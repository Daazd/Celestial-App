In the featured image, Orion was captured by camera showing its full colors last month over a Brazilian copal tree from Brazil's Central-West Region. Here the cool red giant Betelgeuse takes on a strong orange hue as the brightest star on the far left. Otherwise, Orion's hot blue stars are numerous, with supergiant Rigel balancing Betelgeuse at the upper right, Bellatrix at the upper left, and Saiph at the lower right. Lined up in Orion's belt (bottom to top) are Alnitak, Alnilam, and Mintaka all about 1,500 light-years away, born of the constellation's well studied interstellar clouds. And if a ""star"" toward the upper right  Orion's sword looks reddish and fuzzy to you, it should. It's the stellar nursery known as the Great Nebula of Orion.","orion, rising, brazil, seen, next, month, best, seeing, familiar, constellation, rise, night, star, nebula, look, colorful, fantastic, camera, image, featured, captured, showing, full, color, last, brazilian, copal, tree, central-west, region, cool, giant, betelgeuse, take, strong, orange, brightest, left, otherwise, blue, numerous, supergiant, rigel, balancing, upper, right, bellatrix, saiph, lower, lined, belt, bottom, alnitak, alnilam, mintaka, light-year, born, studied, interstellar, cloud, sword, reddish, fuzzy, stellar, nursery, known, great"
Black Hole Safety Video,"If you were a small one-eyed monster, would you want to visit a black hole? Well the one in this video does -- but should it? No, actually, but since our little friend is insistent on going, the video informs it what black holes really are, and how to be as safe as possible when visiting. Black holes are clumps of matter so dense that light cannot escape. Pairs of black holes, each several times the mass of our Sun, have recently been found to merge by detection of unusual gravitational radiation.  The regions surrounding supermassive black holes in the centers of galaxies can light up as stars that near them get shredded. The closest known black hole to the Earth is V616 Mon, which is about 3,300 light years away. The best way for our monster friend to stay safe, the video informs, is to not go too close.","black, hole, safety, small, one-eyed, monster, want, visit, video, little, friend, insistent, going, informs, safe, possible, visiting, clump, matter, dense, light, escape, pair, several, time, mass, found, merge, detection, unusual, gravitational, radiation, region, surrounding, supermassive, center, galaxy, star, shredded, closest, known, earth, v616, year, best, stay"
Molecular Clouds in the Carina Nebula,"They are not alive -- but they are dying. The unusual forms found in the Carina nebula, a few of which are featured here, might best be described as evaporating. Energetic light and winds from nearby stars are breaking apart the dark dust grains that make the iconic forms opaque. Ironically the figures, otherwise known as dark molecular clouds or bright rimmed globules, frequently create in their midst the very stars that later destroy them.  The floating space structures pictured here by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope span a few light months. The Great Nebula in Carina itself spans about 30 light years, lies about 7,500 light years away, and can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of Keel(Carina).","molecular, cloud, carina, alive, dying, unusual, form, found, nebula, featured, best, described, evaporating, energetic, light, wind, nearby, star, breaking, dark, dust, grain, make, iconic, opaque, figure, known, bright, rimmed, globule, create, midst, destroy, floating, space, structure, pictured, orbiting, hubble, telescope, span, month, great, year, seen, small, constellation, keel"
The Hydrogen Clouds of M33,"Gorgeous spiral galaxy M33 seems to have more than its fair share of glowing hydrogen gas. A prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy and lies a mere 3 million light-years away.  The galaxy's inner 30,000 light-years or so are shown in this magnificent 25 panel telescopic mosaic. Based on image data from space and ground-based telescopes, the portrait of M33 shows off the galaxy's reddish ionized hydrogen clouds or HII regions. Sprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core, M33's giant HII regions are some of the largest known stellar nurseries, sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars. Intense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous, massive stars ionizes the surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the characteristic red glow. To enhance this image, broadband data were used to produce a color view of the galaxy and combined with narrowband data recorded through a hydrogen-alpha filter. That filter transmits the light of the strongest visible hydrogen emission line.","hydrogen, cloud, gorgeous, spiral, galaxy, seems, fair, share, glowing, prominent, member, local, group, known, triangulum, light-year, inner, shown, magnificent, panel, telescopic, mosaic, based, image, data, space, ground-based, telescope, portrait, show, reddish, ionized, region, sprawling, loose, wind, core, giant, largest, stellar, nursery, site, formation, short-lived, massive, star, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, luminous, ionizes, surrounding, produce, characteristic, glow, enhance, broadband, used, color, view, combined, recorded, hydrogen-alpha, filter, transmits, light, strongest, visible, emission, line"
InSight on a Cloudy Day,"Clouds drift through the sky as the light fades near sunset in this three frame animated gif. The scene was captured on sol 145 beginning around 6:30pm local time by a camera on the Mars InSight lander. Of course, InSight's martian day, sol 145, corresponds to Earth calendar date April 25, 2019. Under the 69 centimeter (2.3 foot) diameter dome in the foreground is the lander's sensitive seismometer SEIS designed to detect marsquakes. Earthquakes reveal internal structures on planet Earth, and so tremors detected by SEIS can explore beneath the martian surface. In particular, two typical marsquakes were recorded by SEIS on May 22 (sol 173) and July 25 (sol 235). The subtle tremors from the Red Planet are at very low frequencies though, and for listening have to be processed into the audio frequency range. In the sped up recordings external noises more prevalent on cool martian evenings and likely caused by mechanical shifts and contractions have been technically dubbed dinks and donks.","insight, cloudy, cloud, drift, light, fade, sunset, frame, animated, scene, captured, beginning, local, time, camera, lander, course, martian, corresponds, earth, calendar, date, april, centimeter, foot, diameter, dome, foreground, sensitive, seismometer, seis, designed, detect, marsquakes, earthquake, reveal, internal, structure, planet, tremor, detected, beneath, surface, particular, typical, recorded, july, subtle, frequency, listening, processed, audio, range, sped, recording, external, noise, prevalent, cool, evening, caused, mechanical, shift, contraction, dubbed, dink, donks"
Jupiter and the Moons,"After sunset on October 3, some of the Solar System's largest moons stood low along the western horizon with the largest planet. Just after nightfall, a pairing of the Moon approaching first quarter phase and Jupiter was captured in this telephoto field of view. A blend of short and long exposures, it reveals the familiar face of our fair planet's own large natural satellite in stark sunlight and faint earthshine. At lower right are the ruling gas giant and its four Galilean moons. Left to right, the tiny pinpricks of light are Ganymede, [Jupiter], Io, Europa, and Callisto. Our own natural satellite appears to loom large because it's close, but Ganymede, Io, and Callisto are actually larger than Earth's Moon. Water world Europa is only slightly smaller. Of the Solar System's six largest planetary satellites, only Saturn's moon Titan, is missing from this scene. But be sure to check for large moons in your sky tonight.

The Horsehead Nebula,"The Horsehead Nebula is one of the most famous nebulae on the sky.  It is visible as the dark indentation to the red emission nebula in the center of the above photograph.  The horse-head feature is dark because it is really an opaque dust cloud that lies in front of the bright red emission nebula. Like clouds in Earth's atmosphere, this cosmic cloud has assumed a recognizable shape by chance.  After many thousands of years, the internal motions of the cloud will surely alter its appearance.  The emission nebula's red color is caused by electrons recombining with protons to form hydrogen atoms.  On the image left is the Flame Nebula, an orange-tinged nebula that also contains filaments of dark dust. Just to the lower left of the Horsehead nebula featured picture is a blueish reflection nebulae that preferentially reflects the blue light from nearby stars.","horsehead, nebula, famous, visible, dark, indentation, emission, center, photograph, horse-head, feature, opaque, dust, cloud, front, bright, earth, atmosphere, cosmic, assumed, recognizable, shape, chance, many, year, internal, motion, alter, appearance, color, caused, electron, recombining, proton, form, hydrogen, atom, image, left, flame, orange-tinged, contains, filament, featured, picture, blueish, reflection, reflects, blue, light, nearby, star"
Io Eclipse Shadow on Jupiter from Juno,"What's that dark spot on Jupiter? It's the shadow of Jupiter's most volcanic moon Io. Since Jupiter shines predominantly by reflected sunlight, anything that blocks that light leaves a shadow.  If you could somehow be in that shadow, you would see a total eclipse of the Sun by Io.  Io's shadow is about 3600 kilometers across, roughly the same size as Io itself -- and only slightly larger than Earth's Moon. The featured image was taken last month by NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft currently orbiting Jupiter. About every two months, Juno swoops close by Jupiter, takes a lot of data and snaps a series of images -- some of which are made into a video. Among many other things, Juno has been measuring Jupiter's gravitational field, finding surprising evidence that Jupiter may be mostly a liquid. Under unexpectedly thick clouds, the Jovian giant may house a massive liquid hydrogen region that extends all the way to the center.","eclipse, shadow, jupiter, juno, dark, spot, volcanic, moon, shine, reflected, sunlight, anything, block, light, leaf, somehow, total, kilometer, size, larger, earth, featured, image, taken, last, month, nasa, robotic, spacecraft, orbiting, swoop, close, take, data, snap, series, made, video, many, thing, measuring, gravitational, field, finding, surprising, evidence, liquid, thick, cloud, jovian, giant, house, massive, hydrogen, region, extends, center"
Sprite Lightning in HD,"This phenomenon occurs in the sky over our heads, not the sea.  It is a type of lightning known as red sprite, and rarely has it ever been photographed in this detail.  Even though sprites have been recorded for over 30 years, their root cause remains unknown.  Some thunderstorms have them, but most don't. These mysterious bursts of light in the upper atmosphere momentarily resemble gigantic jellyfish. A few years ago high speed videos were taken detailing how red sprites actually develop.  The featured image was captured last month in high definition from Italy.  One unusual feature of sprites is that they are relatively cold -- they operate more like long fluorescent light tubes than hot compact light bulbs.  In general, red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are best seen when powerful thunderstorms are visible from the side.","sprite, lightning, phenomenon, occurs, head, type, known, photographed, detail, recorded, year, root, cause, remains, unknown, thunderstorm, mysterious, burst, light, upper, resemble, gigantic, jellyfish, high, speed, video, taken, detailing, develop, featured, image, captured, last, month, definition, italy, unusual, feature, cold, operate, long, fluorescent, tube, compact, bulb, general, take, fraction, second, occur, best, seen, powerful, visible, side"
NGC 7714: Starburst after Galaxy Collision,"Is this galaxy jumping through a giant ring of stars?  Probably not.  Although the precise dynamics behind the featured image is yet unclear, what is clear is that the pictured galaxy, NGC 7714, has been stretched and distorted by a recent collision with a neighboring galaxy. This smaller neighbor, NGC 7715, situated off to the left of the featured frame, is thought to have charged right through NGC 7714. Observations indicate that the golden ring pictured is composed of millions of older Sun-like stars that are likely co-moving with the interior bluer stars. In contrast, the bright center of NGC 7714 appears to be undergoing a burst of new star formation.  The featured image was captured by the  Hubble Space Telescope.  NGC 7714 is located about 130 million light years away toward the constellation of the Two Fish (Pisces).  The interactions between these galaxies likely started about 150 million years ago and should continue for several hundred million years more, after which a single central galaxy may result.","starburst, galaxy, collision, jumping, giant, ring, star, precise, dynamic, featured, image, unclear, clear, pictured, stretched, distorted, recent, neighboring, smaller, neighbor, situated, left, frame, thought, charged, observation, indicate, golden, composed, older, sun-like, likely, co-moving, interior, bluer, contrast, bright, center, appears, undergoing, burst, formation, captured, hubble, space, telescope, located, light, year, constellation, fish, pisces, interaction, started, continue, several, single, central, result"
Mid-Air Meteor and Milky Way,"On September 24, a late evening commercial flight from Singapore to Australia offered stratospheric views of the southern hemisphere's night sky, if you chose a window seat. In fact, a well-planned seating choice with a window facing toward the Milky Way allowed the set up of a sensitive digital camera on a tripod mount to record the galaxy's central bulge in a series of 10 second long exposures.  By chance, one of the exposures caught this bright fireball meteor in the starry frame. Reflected along the wing of the A380 aircraft, the brilliant greenish streak is also internally reflected in the double layer window, producing a fainter parallel to the original meteor track. In the southern sky Jupiter is the bright source beneath the galactic bulge and seen next to a green beacon, just off the wing tip.","mid-air, meteor, milky, september, late, evening, commercial, flight, singapore, australia, offered, stratospheric, view, southern, night, chose, window, seat, fact, well-planned, seating, choice, facing, allowed, sensitive, digital, camera, tripod, mount, record, galaxy, central, bulge, series, second, long, exposure, chance, caught, bright, fireball, starry, frame, reflected, wing, a380, aircraft, brilliant, greenish, streak, double, layer, producing, fainter, parallel, original, track, jupiter, source, beneath, galactic, seen, next, green, beacon"
Planet Earth at Blue Hour,"Nature photographers and other fans of planet Earth always look forward to the blue hour. That's the transition in twilight, just before sunrise or after sunset, when the Sun is below the horizon but land and sky are still suffused with beautiful bluish hues of light. On August 8 this early morning blue hour panorama scanned along the clear western sky, away from the impending sunrise. A breathtaking scene, it looks down the slopes of Mt. Whitney, from along the John Muir Trail toward rugged peaks of planet Earth's Sierra Nevada mountain range. Above the horizon a faint pinkish band of back scattered sunlight, the anti-twilight arch or Belt of Venus, borders the falling grey shadow of Earth itself. Subtle bands of light across the clear sky are anti-crepuscular rays, defined by shadows of clouds near the sunward horizon. Actually following parallel lines they seem to converge along the horizon at the point opposite the rising Sun due to perspective.","planet, earth, blue, hour, nature, photographer, look, forward, transition, twilight, sunrise, sunset, horizon, land, suffused, beautiful, bluish, light, early, morning, panorama, scanned, clear, western, impending, breathtaking, scene, slope, whitney, john, muir, trail, rugged, peak, sierra, mountain, range, faint, pinkish, band, scattered, sunlight, anti-twilight, arch, belt, venus, border, falling, grey, shadow, subtle, anti-crepuscular, defined, cloud, sunward, following, parallel, line, seem, converge, point, opposite, rising, perspective"
Interplanetary Earth,"In an interplanetary first, on July 19, 2013 Earth was photographed on the same day from two other worlds of the Solar System, innermost planet Mercury and ringed gas giant Saturn. Pictured on the left, Earth is the pale blue dot just below the rings of Saturn, as captured by the robotic Cassini spacecraft then orbiting the outermost gas giant. On that same day people across planet Earth snapped many of their own pictures of Saturn. On the right, the Earth-Moon system is seen against the dark background of space as captured by the robotic MESSENGER spacecraft, then in Mercury orbit. MESSENGER took its image as part of a search for small natural satellites of Mercury, moons that would be expected to be quite dim. In the MESSENGER image, the Earth (left) and Moon (right) are overexposed and shine brightly with reflected sunlight. Destined not to return to their home world, both Cassini and MESSENGER have since retired from their missions of Solar System exploration.","interplanetary, earth, first, july, photographed, world, solar, system, innermost, planet, mercury, ringed, giant, saturn, pictured, left, pale, blue, ring, captured, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, orbiting, outermost, people, snapped, many, picture, right, earth-moon, seen, dark, background, space, messenger, orbit, took, image, part, search, small, natural, satellite, moon, expected, overexposed, shine, reflected, sunlight, destined, return, home, retired, mission, exploration"
A Stellar Jewel Box: Open Cluster NGC 290,"Jewels don't shine this bright -- only stars do.  Like gems in a jewel box, though, the stars of open cluster NGC 290 glitter in a beautiful display of brightness and color.   The photogenic cluster, pictured here, was captured in 2006 by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  Open clusters of stars are younger, contain few stars, and contain a much higher fraction of blue stars than do globular clusters of stars.  NGC 290 lies about 200,000  light-years distant in a neighboring galaxy called the Small Cloud of Magellan (SMC).   The open cluster contains hundreds of stars and spans about 65 light years across.  NGC 290 and other open clusters are good laboratories for studying how stars of different masses evolve, since all the open cluster's stars were born at about the same time.","stellar, jewel, open, cluster, shine, bright, star, glitter, beautiful, display, brightness, color, photogenic, pictured, captured, orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, younger, contain, much, higher, fraction, globular, light-year, distant, neighboring, galaxy, called, small, cloud, magellan, contains, hundred, span, light, year, good, laboratory, studying, different, mass, evolve, born, time"
Andromeda before Photoshop,"What does the Andromeda galaxy really look like? The featured image shows how our Milky Way Galaxy's closest major galactic neighbor really appears in a long exposure through Earth's busy skies and with a digital camera that introduces normal imperfections.  The picture is a stack of 223 images, each a 300 second exposure, taken from a garden observatory in Portugal over the past year.  Obvious image deficiencies include bright parallel airplane trails, long and continuous satellite trails, short cosmic ray streaks, and bad pixels.  These imperfections were actually not removed with Photoshop specifically, but rather greatly reduced with a series of computer software packages that included Astro Pixel Processor, DeepSkyStacker, and PixInsight.  All of this work was done not to deceive you with a digital fantasy that has little to do with the real likeness of the Andromeda galaxy (M31), but to minimize Earthly artifacts that have nothing to do with the distant galaxy and so better recreate what M31 really does look like.","andromeda, photoshop, galaxy, look, featured, image, show, milky, closest, major, galactic, neighbor, appears, long, exposure, earth, busy, digital, camera, introduces, normal, imperfection, picture, stack, second, taken, garden, observatory, portugal, year, obvious, deficiency, include, bright, parallel, airplane, trail, continuous, satellite, short, cosmic, streak, pixel, removed, reduced, series, computer, software, package, included, astro, processor, deepskystacker, pixinsight, work, done, deceive, fantasy, little, real, likeness, minimize, earthly, artifact, nothing, distant, recreate"
The Galaxy Above,"Have you contemplated your home galaxy lately?  If your sky looked like this, perhaps you'd contemplate it more often! The featured picture is actually a composite of two images taken last month from the same location in south Brazil and with the same camera -- but a few hours apart.  The person in the image -- also the astrophotographer -- has much to see in the Milky Way Galaxy above. The central band of our home Galaxy stretches diagonally up from the lower left. This band is dotted with spectacular sights including dark nebular filaments, bright blue stars, and red nebulas.  Millions of fainter and redder stars fill in the deep Galactic background.  To the lower right of the Milky Way are the colorful gas and dust clouds of Rho Ophiuchi, featuring the bright orange star Antares.  On this night, just above and to the right of Antares was the bright planet Jupiter.  The sky is so old and so familiar that humanity has formulated many stories about it, some of which inspired this very picture.","galaxy, contemplated, home, looked, contemplate, featured, picture, composite, image, taken, last, month, location, brazil, camera, hour, person, much, milky, central, band, stretch, lower, left, dotted, spectacular, sight, including, dark, nebular, filament, bright, blue, star, nebula, fainter, redder, fill, deep, galactic, background, right, colorful, dust, cloud, featuring, orange, antares, night, planet, jupiter, familiar, humanity, formulated, many, story, inspired"
BHB2007: A Baby Binary Star in Formation,"How do binary stars form? To help find out, the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) recently captured one of the highest resolution images yet taken of a binary star system in formation.  Most stars are not alone -- they typically form as part of a multiple star systems where star each orbits a common center of gravity.  The two bright spots in the featured image are small disks that surround the forming proto-stars in [BHB2007] 11, while the surrounding pretzel-shaped filaments are gas and dust that have been gravitationally pulled from a larger disk.  The circumstellar filaments span roughly the radius of the orbit of Neptune.  The BHB2007 system is a small part of the Pipe Nebula (also known as Barnard 59), a photogenic network of dust and gas that protrudes from Milky Way's spiral disk in the constellation of Ophiuchus. The binary star formation process should be complete within a few million years.","bhb2007, baby, binary, star, formation, form, help, find, atacama, large, millimeter, array, alma, captured, highest, resolution, image, taken, system, part, multiple, orbit, common, center, gravity, bright, spot, featured, small, disk, surround, forming, proto-stars, surrounding, pretzel-shaped, filament, dust, pulled, larger, circumstellar, span, radius, neptune, pipe, nebula, known, photogenic, network, protrudes, milky, spiral, constellation, process, complete, year"
Moons of Saturn,"On July 29, 2011 the Cassini spacecraft's narrow-angle camera took this snapshot and captured 5 of Saturn's moons, from just above the ringplane. Left to right are small moons Janus and Pandora respectively 179 and 81 kilometers across, shiny 504 kilometer diameter Enceladus, and Mimas, 396 kilometers across, seen just next to Rhea. Cut off by the right edge of the frame, Rhea is Saturn's second largest moon at 1,528 kilometers across. So how many moons does Saturn have? Twenty new found outer satellites bring its total to 82 known moons, and since Jupiter's moon total stands at 79, Saturn is the Solar System's new moon king. The newly announced Saturnian satellites are all very small, 5 kilometers or so in diameter, and most are in retrograde orbits inclined to Saturn's ringplane. You can help name Saturn's new moons, but you should understand the rules. Hint: A knowledge of Norse, Inuit, and Gallic mythology will help.","moon, saturn, cassini, spacecraft, narrow-angle, camera, took, snapshot, captured, ringplane, left, right, small, janus, pandora, kilometer, shiny, diameter, enceladus, mimas, seen, next, rhea, edge, frame, second, largest, many, found, satellite, bring, total, known, jupiter, stand, solar, system, king, announced, saturnian, retrograde, orbit, inclined, help, name, understand, rule, hint, knowledge, norse, inuit, gallic, mythology"
Interstellar Interloper 2I/Borisov,"After the 2017 detecton of 1I/'Oumuamua, comet 2I/Borisov has become the second recognized interstellar interloper. Like 'Oumuamua, Borisov's measured hyperbolic trajectory and speed as it falls toward the Sun confirm that its origin is from beyond our Solar System. But while detailed observations indicate 'Oumuamua is a rocky body with differences from known Solar System objects, Borisov is definitely a far wandering comet. Taken on October 12, 2019 this Hubble Space Telescope image of Borisov reveals a familiar looking comet-like activity and concentration of dust around around its nucleus. Not resolved in the image, some estimates suggest the nucleus could be between 2 and 16 kilometers in diameter. At the time of the Hubble image, comet 2I/Borisov was about 418 million kilometers away. Borisov is still inbound though and will make its closest approach to the Sun on December 7 at a distance of about 300 million kilometers (2 Astronomical units).","interstellar, interloper, detecton, comet, become, second, recognized, 'oumuamua, borisov, measured, hyperbolic, trajectory, speed, fall, confirm, origin, solar, system, detailed, observation, indicate, rocky, body, difference, known, object, wandering, taken, hubble, space, telescope, image, reveals, familiar, looking, comet-like, activity, concentration, dust, resolved, estimate, suggest, nucleus, kilometer, diameter, time, inbound, make, closest, approach, december, distance, astronomical, unit"
All Female Spacewalk Repairs Space Station,"The failed unit was beyond the reach of the robotic Canadarm2.  Therefore, this repair of the International Space Station would require humans. The humans on duty were NASA's Jessica Meir and Christina Koch. This was the fourth spacewalk for Koch, the first for Meir, and the first all-female spacewalk in human history.  The first woman to walk in space was Svetlana Savitskaya in 1984.

Pluto at Night,"The night side of Pluto spans this shadowy scene, a stunning spacebased view with the Sun 4.9 billion kilometers (almost 4.5 light-hours) behind the dim and distant world. It was captured by far flung New Horizons in July of 2015. The spacecraft was at a range of some 21,000 kilometers from Pluto, about 19 minutes after its closest approach. A denizen of the Kuiper Belt in dramatic silhouette, the image also reveals Pluto's tenuous, surprisingly complex layers of hazy atmosphere.

A Mercury Transit Music Video from SDO,"What's that small black dot moving across the Sun? Mercury. Possibly the clearest view of Mercury crossing in front of the Sun in 2016 May was from Earth orbit. The Solar Dynamics Observatory obtained an uninterrupted vista recording it not only in optical light but also in bands of ultraviolet light. Featured here is a composite movie of the crossing set to music. Although the event might prove successful scientifically for better determining components of Mercury' ultra-thin atmosphere, the event surely proved successful culturally by involving people throughout the world in observing a rare astronomical phenomenon.

Night Sky Reflections from the World's Largest Mirror,"What's being reflected in the world's largest mirror?  Stars, galaxies, and a planet.  Many of these stars are confined to the grand arch that runs across the image, an arch that is the central plane of our home Milky Way Galaxy. Inside the arch is another galaxy -- the neighboring Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  Stars that are individually visible include Antares on the far left and Sirius on the far right. The planet Jupiter shines brightly just below Antares. The featured picture is composed of 15 vertical frames taken consecutively over ten minutes from the Uyuni Salt Flat in Bolivia. Uyuni Salt Flat (Salar de Uyuni) is the largest salt flat on Earth and is so large and so extraordinarily flat that, after a rain, it can become the world's largest mirror -- spanning 130 kilometers.

Starry Night by Vincent van Gogh,"The painting Starry Night is one of the most famous icons of the night sky ever created.   The scene was painted by Vincent van Gogh in southern France in 1889.   The swirling style of Starry Night appears, to many, to make the night sky come alive.   Although van Gogh frequently portrayed real settings in his paintings, art historians do not agree on precisely what stars and planets are being depicted in Starry Night.   The style of Starry Night is post-impressionism, a popular painting style at the end of the nineteenth century.

It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within from collapsing cores only visible at long infrared wavelengths. Still, colorful stars in Cepheus add to the pretty, galactic skyscape.","dark, seahorse, cepheus, light-year, suggestive, shape, known, nebula, appears, silhouette, rich, luminous, background, star, seen, royal, northern, constellation, dusty, obscuring, cloud, part, milky, molecular, distant, listed, b150, marking, cataloged, 20th, century, astronomer, mass, forming, collapsing, core, visible, infrared, wavelength, colorful, galactic, skyscape"
The Ghosts of Cassiopeia,"These bright rims and flowing shapes look ghostly on a cosmic scale. A telescopic view toward the constellation Cassiopeia, the colorful skyscape features swept-back, comet-shaped clouds IC 59 (left) and IC 63. About 600 light-years distant, the clouds aren't actually ghosts. They are slowly disappearing though, under the influence of energetic radiation from hot,luminous star gamma Cas. Gamma Cas is physically located only 3 to 4 light-years from the nebulae, the bright star just above and left in the frame. Slightly closer to gamma Cas, IC 63 is dominated by red H-alpha light emitted as hydrogen atoms ionized by the star's ultraviolet radiation recombine with electrons. Farther from the star, IC 59 shows proportionally less H-alpha emission but more of the characteristic blue tint of dust reflected star light. The field of view spans over 1 degree or 10 light-years at the estimated distance of gamma Cas and friends.","ghost, cassiopeia, bright, flowing, shape, look, cosmic, scale, telescopic, view, constellation, colorful, skyscape, feature, swept-back, comet-shaped, cloud, left, light-year, distant, disappearing, influence, energetic, radiation, luminous, star, gamma, located, nebula, frame, dominated, h-alpha, light, emitted, hydrogen, atom, ionized, ultraviolet, recombine, electron, show, emission, characteristic, blue, tint, dust, reflected, field, span, degree, estimated, distance, friend"
Gravity's Grin,"Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, published over 100 years ago, predicted the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. And that's what gives these distant galaxies such a whimsical appearance, seen through the looking glass of X-ray and optical image data from the Chandra and Hubble space telescopes. Nicknamed the Cheshire Cat galaxy group, the group's two large elliptical galaxies are suggestively framed by arcs. The arcs are optical images of distant background galaxies lensed by the foreground group's total distribution of gravitational mass. Of course, that gravitational mass is dominated by dark matter. The two large elliptical ""eye"" galaxies represent the brightest members of their own galaxy groups which are merging. Their relative collisional speed of nearly 1,350 kilometers/second heats gas to millions of degrees producing the X-ray glow shown in purple hues. Curiouser about galaxy group mergers? The Cheshire Cat group grins in the constellation Ursa Major, some 4.6 billion light-years away.","gravity, grin, albert, einstein, general, theory, relativity, published, year, predicted, phenomenon, gravitational, lensing, give, distant, galaxy, whimsical, appearance, seen, looking, glass, x-ray, optical, image, data, chandra, hubble, space, telescope, nicknamed, cheshire, group, large, elliptical, framed, background, lensed, foreground, total, distribution, mass, course, dominated, dark, matter, represent, brightest, member, merging, relative, collisional, speed, kilometers/second, heat, degree, producing, glow, shown, purple, curiouser, merger, constellation, ursa, major, light-year"
Ghost Aurora over Canada,"What does this aurora look like to you? While braving the cold to watch the skies above northern Canada early one morning in 2013, a most unusual aurora appeared.  The aurora definitely appeared to be shaped like something , but what? Two ghostly possibilities recorded by the astrophotographer were ""witch"" and ""goddess of dawn"", but please feel free to suggest your own Halloween-enhanced impressions. Regardless of fantastical pareidolic interpretations, the pictured aurora had a typical green color and was surely caused by the scientifically commonplace action of high energy particles from space interacting with oxygen in Earth's upper atmosphere.  In the image foreground, at the bottom, is a frozen Alexandra Falls, while evergreen trees cross the middle.","ghost, canada, aurora, look, braving, cold, watch, early, morning, unusual, appeared, shaped, something, possibility, recorded, witch, goddess, dawn, please, feel, free, suggest, halloween-enhanced, impression, fantastical, pareidolic, interpretation, pictured, typical, green, color, caused, commonplace, action, high, energy, particle, space, interacting, oxygen, earth, upper, atmosphere, image, foreground, bottom, frozen, alexandra, fall, evergreen, tree, cross, middle"
The Space Station Crosses a Spotless Sun,"Typically, the International Space Station is visible only at night.  Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot about once a month from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS's silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken a month ago from Santa Fe, Argentina with perfect timing.  This image series was later combined with a separate image highlighting the texture of the spotless Sun, and an image bringing up the Sun's prominences around the edge. At an unusually low Solar Minimum, the Sun has gone without sunspots now for most of 2019.

Curiosity Rover Finds a Clay Cache on Mars,"Why is there clay on Mars? On Earth, clay can form at the bottom of a peaceful lake when specific minerals trap water.  At the pictured site on Mars, the robotic rover Curiosity drilled into two rocks and found the highest concentration of clay yet.  The clay cache is considered addition evidence that Gale Crater once held water in the distant past.  Pictured, 57 images taken by Curiosity have been combined into a selfie. The images were taken by a camera at the end of its robotic arm. Many details of the car-sized rover are visible, including its rugged wheels, numerous scientific instruments, and a high mast that contains camera ""eyes"", one of which can shoot out an infrared laser beam.  Curiosity continues to roll around and up Mount Sharp -- in the center of Gale Crater -- in a search for new clues about the ancient history of Mars and whether or not the red planet once had conditions that could support life.","curiosity, rover, find, clay, cache, earth, form, bottom, peaceful, lake, specific, mineral, trap, water, pictured, site, robotic, drilled, rock, found, highest, concentration, considered, addition, evidence, gale, crater, held, distant, past, image, taken, combined, selfie, camera, many, detail, car-sized, visible, including, rugged, wheel, numerous, scientific, instrument, high, mast, contains, shoot, infrared, laser, beam, continues, roll, mount, sharp, center, search, clue, ancient, history, planet, condition, support, life"
M42: Inside the Orion Nebula,"The Great Nebula in Orion, an immense, nearby starbirth region, is probably the most famous of all astronomical nebulas.  Here, glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud only 1500 light-years away.  In the featured deep image in assigned colors highlighted by emission in oxygen and hydrogen, wisps and sheets of dust and gas are particularly evident.  The Great Nebula in Orion can be found with the unaided eye near the easily identifiable belt of three stars in the popular constellation Orion.  In addition to housing a bright open cluster of stars known as the Trapezium, the Orion Nebula contains many stellar nurseries.   These nurseries contain much hydrogen gas, hot young stars, proplyds, and stellar jets spewing material at high speeds.  Also known as M42, the Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.","orion, great, nebula, immense, nearby, starbirth, region, famous, astronomical, glowing, surround, young, star, edge, interstellar, molecular, cloud, light-year, featured, deep, image, assigned, color, highlighted, emission, oxygen, hydrogen, wisp, sheet, dust, evident, found, unaided, identifiable, belt, popular, constellation, addition, housing, bright, open, cluster, known, trapezium, contains, many, stellar, nursery, much, proplyds, spewing, material, high, speed, span, light, year, located, spiral, galaxy"
The Ghostly Veil Nebula,"A ghostly visage on a cosmic scale, these remains of shocked, glowing gas haunt planet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus and form the Veil Nebula. The nebula itself is a large supernova remnant, an expanding cloud born of the death explosion of a massive star. Light from the original supernova explosion likely reached Earth over 5,000 years ago. Also known as the Cygnus Loop, the Veil Nebula now spans nearly 3 degrees or about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon. That translates to over 70 light-years at its estimated distance of 1,500 light-years. In fact, the Veil is so large its brighter parts are recognized as separate nebulae, including The Witch's Broom (NGC 6960) below and right of center.

The Day After Mars,"October 31, 1938 was the day after Martians encountered planet Earth, and everything was calm. Reports of the invasion were revealed to be part of a Halloween radio drama, the now famous broadcast based on H.G. Wells' scifi novel War of the Worlds. On Mars October 20, 2014 was calm too, the day after its close encounter with Comet Siding Spring (C/2013 A1). Not a hoax, this comet really did come within 86,700 miles or so of Mars, about 1/3 the Earth-Moon distance. Earth's spacecraft and rovers in Mars orbit and on the surface reported no ill effects though, and had a ringside seat as a visitor from the outer solar system passed by. Spanning over 2 degrees against stars of the constellation Ophiuchus, this colorful telescopic snapshot captures our view of Mars on the day after.

Inside the Flame Nebula,"The Flame Nebula stands out in this optical image of the dusty, crowded star forming regions toward Orion's belt, a mere 1,400 light-years away. X-ray data from the Chandra Observatory and infrared images from the Spitzer Space Telescope can take you inside the glowing gas and obscuring dust clouds though. Swiping your cursor (or clicking the image) will reveal many stars of the recently formed, embedded cluster NGC 2024, ranging in age from 200,000 years to 1.5 million years young. The X-ray/infrared composite image overlay spans about 15 light-years across the Flame's center. The X-ray/infrared data also indicate that the youngest stars are concentrated near the middle of the Flame Nebula cluster. That's the opposite of the simplest models of star formation for the stellar nursery that predict star formation begins in the denser center of a molecular cloud core. The result requires a more complex model; perhaps star formation continues longer in the center, or older stars are ejected from the center due to subcluster mergers.","flame, nebula, stand, optical, image, dusty, crowded, star, forming, region, orion, belt, light-year, x-ray, data, chandra, observatory, infrared, spitzer, space, telescope, take, glowing, obscuring, dust, cloud, swiping, cursor, clicking, reveal, many, formed, embedded, cluster, ranging, year, young, x-ray/infrared, composite, overlay, span, center, indicate, youngest, concentrated, middle, opposite, simplest, model, formation, stellar, nursery, predict, denser, molecular, core, result, requires, complex, continues, older, ejected, subcluster, merger"
Daphnis and the Rings of Saturn,"What's happening to the rings of Saturn? A little moon making big waves. The moon is 8-kilometer Daphnis and it is making waves in the Keeler Gap of Saturn's rings using just its gravity -- as it bobs up and down, in and out.  The featured image is a colored and more detailed version of a previously released images taken in 2017 by the robotic Cassini spacecraft during one of its Grand Finale orbits. Daphnis can be seen on the far right, sporting ridges likely accumulated from ring particles.  Daphnis was discovered in Cassini images in 2005 and raised mounds of ring particles so high in 2009 -- during Saturn's equinox when the ring plane pointed directly at the Sun -- that they cast notable shadows.","daphnis, ring, saturn, happening, little, moon, making, wave, 8-kilometer, keeler, using, gravity, featured, image, colored, detailed, version, released, taken, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, grand, finale, orbit, seen, right, sporting, ridge, accumulated, particle, discovered, raised, mound, high, equinox, plane, pointed, cast, notable, shadow"
Near the Center of the Lagoon Nebula,"Stars are battling gas and dust in the Lagoon Nebula but the photographers are winning. Also known as M8, this photogenic nebula is visible even without binoculars towards the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius). The energetic processes of star formation create not only the colors but the chaos. The glowing gas results from high-energy starlight striking interstellar hydrogen gas and trace amounts of sulfur, and oxygen gases. The dark dust filaments that lace M8 were created in the atmospheres of cool giant stars and in the debris from supernovae explosions. The light from M8 we see today left about 5,000 years ago. Light takes about 50 years to cross this section of M8.","center, lagoon, nebula, star, battling, dust, photographer, winning, known, photogenic, visible, binoculars, towards, constellation, sagittarius, energetic, process, formation, create, color, chaos, glowing, result, high-energy, starlight, striking, interstellar, hydrogen, trace, amount, sulfur, oxygen, dark, filament, lace, created, cool, giant, debris, supernova, explosion, light, today, left, year, take, cross, section"
Spiral Galaxies Spinning Super-Fast,"Why are these galaxies spinning so fast?  If you estimated each spiral's mass by how much light it emits, their fast rotations should break them apart.  The leading hypothesis as to why these galaxies don't break apart is dark matter -- mass so dark we can't see it. But these galaxies are even out-spinning this break-up limit -- they are the fastest rotating disk galaxies known.  It is therefore further hypothesized that their dark matter halos are so massive -- and their spins so fast -- that it is harder for them to form stars than regular spirals. If so, then these galaxies may be among the most massive spirals possible. Further study of surprising super-spirals like these will continue, likely including observations taken by NASA's James Webb Space Telescope scheduled for launch in 2021.","spiral, galaxy, spinning, super-fast, estimated, mass, light, emits, fast, rotation, break, leading, hypothesis, apart, dark, matter, out-spinning, break-up, limit, fastest, rotating, disk, known, hypothesized, halo, spin, harder, form, star, regular, massive, possible, study, surprising, super-spirals, continue, likely, including, observation, taken, nasa, james, webb, space, telescope, scheduled, launch"
21st Century M101,"One of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is definitely not one of the least. About 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost twice the size of our own Milky Way Galaxy. M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed with Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsonstown. In contrast, this multiwavelength view of the large island universe is a composite of images recorded by space-based telescopes in the 21st century. Color coded from X-rays to infrared wavelengths (high to low energies), the image data was taken from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (purple), the Galaxy Evolution Explorer (blue), Hubble Space Telescope(yellow), and the Spitzer Space Telescope(red). While the X-ray data trace the location of multimillion degree gas around M101's exploded stars and neutron star and black hole binary star systems, the lower energy data follow the stars and dust that define M101's grand spiral arms. Also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101 lies within the boundaries of the northern constellation Ursa Major, about 25 million light-years away.","21st, century, m101, last, entry, charles, messier, famous, catalog, beautiful, spiral, galaxy, least, light-year, enormous, size, milky, original, nebula, observed, lord, rosse, large, 19th, telescope, leviathan, parsonstown, contrast, multiwavelength, view, island, universe, composite, image, recorded, space-based, color, coded, x-ray, infrared, high, energy, data, taken, chandra, observatory, purple, evolution, explorer, blue, hubble, space, yellow, spitzer, trace, location, multimillion, degree, exploded, star, neutron, black, hole, binary, system, follow, dust, define, grand, known, pinwheel, boundary, northern, constellation, major"
Messier 45: The Daughters of Atlas and Pleione,"Hurtling through a cosmic dust cloud a mere 400 light-years away, the lovely Pleiades or Seven Sisters open star cluster is well-known for its striking blue reflection nebulae. It lies in the night sky toward the constellation Taurus and the Orion Arm of our Milky Way Galaxy. The sister stars and cosmic dust cloud are not related though, they just happen to be passing through the same region of space. Known since antiquity as a compact grouping of stars, Galileo first sketched the star cluster viewed through his telescope with stars too faint to be seen by eye.  Charles Messier recorded the position of the cluster as the 45th entry in his famous catalog of things which are not comets. In Greek myth, the Pleiades were seven daughters of the astronomical titan Atlas and sea-nymph Pleione. Their parents names are included in the cluster's nine brightest stars. This deep and wide telescopic image spans over 20 light-years across the Pleides star cluster.","daughter, atlas, pleione, hurtling, cosmic, dust, cloud, light-year, pleiades, sister, open, star, cluster, well-known, striking, blue, reflection, nebula, night, constellation, taurus, orion, milky, galaxy, related, happen, passing, region, space, known, antiquity, compact, grouping, galileo, sketched, viewed, telescope, faint, seen, charles, recorded, position, entry, famous, catalog, thing, comet, greek, myth, astronomical, titan, sea-nymph, parent, name, included, brightest, deep, wide, telescopic, image, span, pleides"
NGC 3572 and the Southern Tadpoles,"This cosmic skyscape features glowing gas and dark dust clouds along side the young stars of NGC 3572. A beautiful emission nebula and star cluster in far southern skies, the region is often overlooked by astroimagers in favor of its brighter neighbor, the nearby Carina Nebula. Stars from NGC 3572 are toward the upper left in the telescopic frame that would measure about 100 light-years across at the cluster's estimated distant of 9,000 light-years. The visible interstellar gas and dust is part of the star cluster's natal molecular cloud. Dense streamers of material within the nebula, eroded by stellar winds and radiation, clearly trail away from the energetic young stars. They are likely sites of ongoing star formation with shapes reminiscent of the cosmic Tadpoles of IC 410 better known to northern skygazers.  In the coming tens to hundreds of millions of years, gas and stars in the cluster will be dispersed though, by gravitational tides and by violent supernova explosions that end the short lives of the massive cluster stars.","southern, tadpole, cosmic, skyscape, feature, glowing, dark, dust, cloud, side, young, star, beautiful, emission, nebula, cluster, region, overlooked, astroimagers, favor, brighter, neighbor, nearby, carina, upper, left, telescopic, frame, measure, light-year, estimated, distant, visible, interstellar, part, natal, molecular, dense, streamer, material, eroded, stellar, wind, radiation, trail, energetic, likely, site, ongoing, formation, shape, reminiscent, better, known, northern, skygazers, coming, year, dispersed, gravitational, tide, violent, supernova, explosion, short, life, massive"
Saturn the Giant,"On May 25, 1961 U.S. president John Kennedy announced the goal of landing astronauts on the Moon by the end of the decade. By November 9, 1967 this Saturn V rocket was ready for launch and the first full test of its capabilities on the Apollo 4 mission. Its development directed by rocket pioneer Wernher Von Braun, the three stage Saturn V stood over 36 stories tall. It had a cluster of five first stage engines fueled by liquid oxygen and kerosene which together were capable of producing 7.9 million pounds of thrust. Giant Saturn V rockets ultimately hurled nine Apollo missions to the Moon and back again with six landing on the lunar surface. The first landing mission, Apollo 11, achieved Kennedy's goal on July 20, 1969.

A Mercury Transit Sequence,"Tomorrow -- Monday --  Mercury will cross the face of the Sun, as seen from Earth. Called a transit, the last time this happened was in 2016.  Because the plane of Mercury's orbit is not exactly coincident with the plane of Earth's orbit, Mercury usually appears to pass over or under the Sun.  The featured time-lapse sequence, superimposed on a single frame, was taken from a balcony in Belgium shows the entire  transit of 2003 May 7.  That solar crossing lasted over five hours, so that the above 23 images were taken roughly 15 minutes apart.  The north pole of the Sun, the Earth's orbit, and Mercury's orbit, although all different, all occur in directions slightly above the left of the image. Near the center and on the far right, sunspots are visible. After Monday, the next transit of Mercury will occur in 2032.

Lunar Craters Langrenus and Petavius,"The history of the Moon is partly written in its craters.  Pictured here is a lunar panorama taken from Earth featuring the large craters Langrenus, toward the left, and Petavius, toward the right. The craters formed in separate impacts. Langrenus spans about 130 km, has a terraced rim, and sports a central peak rising about 3 km.  Petavius is slightly larger with a 180 km diameter and has a distinctive fracture that runs out from its center. Although it is known that Petravius crater is about 3.9 billion years old, the origin of its large fracture is unknown.  The craters are best visible a few days after a new Moon, when shadows most greatly accentuate vertical walls and hills.  The featured image is a composite of the best of thousands of high-resolution, infrared, video images taken through a small telescope.  Although mountains on Earth will likely erode into soil over a billion years, lunar craters Langrenus and Petavius will likely survive many billions more years, possibly until the Sun expands and engulfs both the Earth and Moon.

NGC 3717: A Nearly Sideways Spiral Galaxy,"Some spiral galaxies are seen nearly sideways. Most bright stars in spiral galaxies swirl around the center in a disk, and seen from the side, this disk can appear quite thin.  Some spiral galaxies appear even thinner than NGC 3717, which is actually seen tilted just a bit.  Spiral galaxies form disks because the original gas collided with itself and cooled as it fell inward.  Planets may orbit in disks for similar reasons.  The featured image by the Hubble Space Telescope shows a light-colored central bulge composed of older stars beyond filaments of orbiting dark brown dust.  NGC 3717 spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 60 million light years away toward the constellation of the Water Snake (Hydra).

Mercury in Silhouette,"The small, dark, round spot in this solar close up is planet Mercury. In the high resolution telescopic image, a colorized stack of 61 sharp video frames, a turbulent array of photospheric convection cells tile the bright solar surface.  Mercury's more regular silhouette still stands out though. Of course, only inner planets Mercury and Venus can transit the Sun to appear in silhouette when viewed from planet Earth. For this November 11, 2019 transit of Mercury, the innermost planet's silhouette was a mere 1/200th the solar diameter. So even under clear daytime skies it was difficult to see without the aid of a safe solar telescope. Following its transit in 2016, this was Mercury's 4th of 14 transits across the solar disk in the 21st century. The next transit of Mercury will be on November 13, 2032.","mercury, silhouette, small, dark, round, spot, solar, close, planet, high, resolution, telescopic, image, colorized, sharp, video, frame, turbulent, array, photospheric, convection, cell, tile, bright, surface, regular, stand, course, inner, venus, transit, appear, viewed, earth, innermost, diameter, clear, daytime, difficult, safe, telescope, following, disk, 21st, century, next"
Mercury and the Quiet Sun,"On November 11, 2019 the Sun was mostly quiet, experiencing a minimum in its 11 year cycle of activity. In fact, the only spot visible was actually planet Mercury, making a leisurely 5 1/2 hour transit in front of the calm solar disk. About 1/200th the apparent diameter of the Sun, the silhouette of the solar system's inner most planet is near center in this sharp, full Sun snapshot. Taken with a hydrogen alpha filter and safe solar telescope, the image also captures prominences around the solar limb, the glowing plasma trapped in arcing magnetic fields. Of course, only inner planets Mercury and Venus can transit the Sun to appear in silhouette when viewed from planet Earth.

M16 and the Eagle Nebula,"A star cluster around 2 million years young surrounded by natal clouds of dust and glowing gas, M16 is also known as The Eagle Nebula. This beautifully detailed portrait of the region was made with groundbased narrow and broadband image data. It includes cosmic sculptures made famous in Hubble Space Telescope close-ups of the starforming complex. Described as elephant trunks or Pillars of Creation, dense, dusty columns rising near the center are light-years in length but are gravitationally contracting to form stars. Energetic radiation from the cluster stars erodes material near the tips, eventually exposing the embedded new stars. Extending from the ridge of bright emission at lower left is another dusty starforming column known as the Fairy of Eagle Nebula. M16 lies about 7,000 light-years away, an easy target for binoculars or small telescopes in a nebula rich part of the sky toward the split constellation Serpens Cauda (the tail of the snake).","eagle, nebula, star, cluster, year, young, surrounded, natal, cloud, dust, glowing, known, detailed, portrait, region, made, groundbased, narrow, broadband, image, data, includes, cosmic, sculpture, famous, hubble, space, telescope, close-ups, starforming, complex, described, elephant, trunk, pillar, creation, dense, dusty, column, rising, center, light-year, length, contracting, form, energetic, radiation, erodes, material, exposing, embedded, extending, ridge, bright, emission, left, fairy, easy, target, binoculars, small, rich, part, split, constellation, serpens, cauda, tail, snake"
The Star Streams of NGC 5907,"Grand tidal streams of stars seem to surround galaxy NGC 5907. The arcing structures form tenuous loops extending more than 150,000 light-years from the narrow, edge-on spiral, also known as the Splinter or Knife Edge Galaxy. Recorded only in very deep exposures, the streams likely represent the ghostly trail of a dwarf galaxy - debris left along the orbit of a smaller satellite galaxy that was gradually torn apart and merged with NGC 5907 over four billion years ago. Ultimately this remarkable discovery image, from a small robotic observatory in New Mexico, supports the cosmological scenario in which large spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way, were formed by the accretion of smaller ones.

To help find out, astronomers created this tantalizing false-color composition of dust clouds and embedded newborn stars in infrared wavelengths with WISE, the Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. The cosmic canvas features one of the closest star forming regions, part of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud complex some 400 light-years distant near the southern edge of the pronounceable constellation Ophiuchus. After forming along a large cloud of cold molecular hydrogen gas, young stars heat the surrounding dust to produce the infrared glow. Stars in the process of formation, called young stellar objects or YSOs, are embedded in the compact pinkish nebulae seen here, but are otherwise hidden from the prying eyes of optical telescopes. An exploration of the region in penetrating infrared light has detected emerging and newly formed stars whose average age is estimated to be a mere 300,000 years. That's extremely young compared to the Sun's age of 5 billion years. The prominent reddish nebula at the lower right surrounding the star Sigma Scorpii is a reflection nebula produced by dust scattering starlight. This view from WISE, released in 2012, spans almost 2 degrees and covers about 14 light-years at the estimated distance of the Rho Ophiuchi cloud.","young, star, cloud, form, help, find, astronomer, created, tantalizing, false-color, composition, dust, embedded, newborn, infrared, wavelength, wise, wide-field, survey, explorer, cosmic, canvas, feature, closest, forming, region, part, ophiuchi, complex, light-year, distant, southern, edge, pronounceable, constellation, large, cold, molecular, hydrogen, heat, surrounding, produce, glow, process, formation, called, stellar, object, ysos, compact, pinkish, nebula, seen, hidden, prying, optical, telescope, exploration, penetrating, light, detected, emerging, formed, average, estimated, year, compared, prominent, reddish, lower, right, sigma, scorpii, reflection, produced, scattering, starlight, view, released, span, degree, distance"
Passing Asteroid Arrokoth,"What would it look like to pass asteroid Arrokoth? The robotic New Horizons spacecraft zoomed past Arrokoth in January, 3.5 years after the spacecraft passed Pluto.  If this object's name doesn't sound familiar, that may be because the distant, double-lobed, Kuiper-belt object was unofficially dubbed Ultima Thule until recently receiving its official name: 486958 Arrokoth.  The featured black and white video animates images of Arrokoth taken by New Horizons at different angles as it zoomed by.  The video clearly shows Arrokoth's two lobes, and even hints that the larger lobe is significantly flattened.  New Horizons found that Arrokoth is different from any known asteroid in the inner Solar System and is likely composed of two joined planetesimals -- the building blocks of planets as they existed billions of years ago. New Horizons continues to speed out of our Solar System gaining about three additional Earth-Sun separations every year.","passing, asteroid, look, robotic, horizon, spacecraft, zoomed, past, arrokoth, january, year, passed, pluto, object, name, sound, familiar, distant, double-lobed, kuiper-belt, dubbed, ultima, thule, receiving, official, featured, black, white, video, animates, image, taken, different, angle, show, lobe, hint, larger, flattened, found, known, inner, solar, system, composed, joined, planetesimal, building, block, planet, existed, continues, speed, gaining, additional, earth-sun, separation"
Milky Way over Uruguayan Lighthouse,"Can a lighthouse illuminate a galaxy? No, but in the featured image, gaps in light emanating from the Jose Ignacio Lighthouse in Uruguay appear to match up nicely, although only momentarily and coincidently, with dark dust lanes of our Milky Way Galaxy. The bright dot on the right is the planet Jupiter.  The central band of the Milky Way Galaxy is actually the central spiral disk seen from within the disk. The Milky Way band is not easily visible through city lights but can be quite spectacular to see in dark skies.  The featured picture is actually the addition of ten consecutive images taken by the same camera from the same location.  The images were well planned to exclude direct light from the famous lighthouse.","milky, uruguayan, lighthouse, illuminate, galaxy, featured, image, light, emanating, jose, ignacio, uruguay, appear, match, dark, dust, lane, bright, right, planet, jupiter, central, band, spiral, disk, seen, visible, city, spectacular, picture, addition, consecutive, taken, camera, location, planned, exclude, direct, famous"
Arp 273: Battling Galaxies from Hubble,"What's happening to these spiral galaxies? Although details remain uncertain, there sure seems to be a titanic battle going on.  The upper galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partners is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of the UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. The blue color of the outer ring at the top is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner part of the upper galaxy -- itself an older spiral galaxy -- appears redder and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to colliding galaxies, while several far-distant galaxies are visible in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.  Quite likely, UGC 1810 will devour its galactic sidekicks over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form.","battling, galaxy, hubble, happening, spiral, detail, remain, uncertain, sure, seems, titanic, battle, going, upper, labelled, collisional, partner, known, overall, shape, particular, blue, outer, ring, likely, result, wild, violent, gravitational, interaction, color, caused, massive, star, formed, year, inner, part, older, appears, redder, threaded, cool, filamentary, dust, bright, appear, unrelated, colliding, several, far-distant, visible, background, light, constellation, andromeda, devour, galactic, sidekick, next, classic, form"
Simeis 147: Supernova Remnant,"It's easy to get lost following the intricate looping filaments in this detailed image of supernova remnant Simeis 147. Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240 it goes by the popular nickname, the Spaghetti Nebula. Seen toward the boundary of the constellations Taurus and Auriga, it covers nearly 3 degrees or 6 full moons on the sky. That's about 150 light-years at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years. This composite includes image data taken through narrow-band filters where reddish emission from ionized hydrogen atoms and doubly ionized oxygen atoms in faint blue-green hues trace the shocked, glowing gas. The supernova remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000 years, meaning light from the massive stellar explosion first reached Earth 40,000 years ago. But the expanding remnant is not the only aftermath. The cosmic catastrophe also left behind a spinning neutron star or pulsar, all that remains of the original star's core.","simeis, supernova, remnant, easy, lost, following, intricate, looping, filament, detailed, image, cataloged, sharpless, 2-240, popular, nickname, spaghetti, nebula, seen, boundary, constellation, taurus, auriga, degree, full, moon, light-year, stellar, debris, cloud, estimated, distance, composite, includes, data, taken, narrow-band, filter, reddish, emission, ionized, hydrogen, atom, oxygen, faint, blue-green, trace, shocked, glowing, year, meaning, light, massive, explosion, reached, earth, expanding, aftermath, cosmic, catastrophe, left, spinning, neutron, star, pulsar, remains, original, core"
Orion Rising,"Looking toward the east in the early hours of a September morning this single exposure made with tripod and camera captured a simple visual experience. Rising above the tree-lined slope are familiar stars in planet Earth's northern night and the constellation Orion the Hunter.  Brighter stars marking the celestial Hunter's shoulder (Betelgeuse), foot (Rigel), belt, and sword are clearly reflected in the calm waters from northern Latvia's Vitrupe river. Of course, winter is coming to planet Earth's northern hemisphere.   By then Orion and this beautiful starry vista will be seen rising in early evening skies.","orion, rising, looking, early, hour, september, morning, single, exposure, made, tripod, camera, captured, simple, visual, experience, tree-lined, slope, familiar, star, planet, earth, northern, night, constellation, hunter, brighter, marking, celestial, shoulder, betelgeuse, foot, rigel, belt, sword, reflected, calm, water, latvia, vitrupe, river, course, winter, coming, hemisphere, beautiful, starry, vista, seen, evening"
Apollo 12 and Surveyor 3 Stereo View,"Put on your red/blue glasses and gaze across the western Ocean of Storms on the surface of the Moon. The 3D view features Apollo 12 astronaut Pete Conrad visiting the Surveyor 3 spacecraft 50 years ago in November of 1969. Surveyor 3 had landed at the site on the inside slope of a small crater about 2 1/2 years earlier in April of 1967. Visible on the horizon beyond the far crater wall, Apollo 12's Lunar Module Intrepid touched down less than 200 meters (650 feet) away, easy moonwalking distance from the robotic Surveyor spacecraft. The stereo image was carefully created from two separate pictures (AS12-48-7133, AS12-48-7134) taken on the lunar surface. They depict the scene from only slightly different viewpoints, approximating the separation between human eyes.","surveyor, stereo, view, red/blue, glass, gaze, western, ocean, storm, surface, moon, feature, apollo, astronaut, pete, conrad, visiting, spacecraft, year, landed, site, slope, small, crater, visible, horizon, wall, lunar, module, intrepid, touched, less, meter, foot, easy, moonwalking, distance, robotic, image, created, separate, picture, as12-48-7133, as12-48-7134, taken, depict, scene, different, viewpoint, approximating, separation, human"
Apollo 12: Self-Portrait,"Is this image art?  50 years ago, Apollo 12 astronaut-photographer Charles ""Pete"" Conrad recorded this masterpiece while documenting colleague Alan Bean's lunar soil collection activities on  Oceanus Procellarum.  The featured image is dramatic and stark.  The harsh environment of the Moon's Ocean of Storms is echoed in Bean's helmet, a perfectly composed reflection of Conrad and the lunar horizon.  Works of photojournalists originally intent on recording the human condition on planet Earth, such as Lewis W. Hine's images from New York City in the early 20th century, or Margaret Bourke-White's magazine photography are widely regarded as art.  Similarly many documentary astronomy and space images might also be appreciated for their artistic and esthetic appeal.","self-portrait, image, year, apollo, astronaut-photographer, charles, pete, conrad, recorded, documenting, colleague, alan, bean, lunar, soil, collection, activity, procellarum, featured, dramatic, stark, harsh, environment, moon, ocean, storm, echoed, helmet, composed, reflection, horizon, work, photojournalist, intent, recording, human, condition, planet, earth, lewis, hine, york, city, 20th, century, margaret, bourke-white, magazine, photography, regarded, many, documentary, astronomy, space, appreciated, artistic, esthetic, appeal"
NGC 6995: The Bat Nebula,"Do you see the bat?  It haunts this cosmic close-up of the eastern Veil Nebula.  The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant, the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star. While the Veil is roughly circular in shape and covers nearly 3 degrees on the sky toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus), the Bat Nebula, NGC 6995, spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size of the Moon. That translates to 12 light-years at the Veil's estimated distance, a reassuring 1,400 light-years from planet Earth. In the composite of image data recorded through broad and narrow band filters, emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong emission from oxygen and nitrogen atoms shown in hues of blue. Of course, in the western part of the Veil lies another seasonal apparition: the Witch's Broom Nebula.","haunt, cosmic, close-up, eastern, veil, nebula, large, supernova, remnant, expanding, debris, cloud, death, explosion, massive, star, circular, shape, cover, degree, constellation, swan, cygnus, span, apparent, size, moon, translates, light-year, estimated, distance, reassuring, planet, earth, composite, image, data, recorded, broad, narrow, band, filter, emission, hydrogen, atom, shown, strong, oxygen, nitrogen, blue, course, western, part, seasonal, apparition, witch, broom"
Venus and Jupiter on the Horizon,"What are those two bright objects on the horizon? Venus and Jupiter. The two brightest planets in the night sky passed very close together -- angularly -- just two days ago.  In real space, they were just about as far apart as usual, since Jupiter (on the right) orbits the Sun around seven times farther out than Venus.  The planetary duo were captured together two days ago in a picturesque sunset sky from Llers, Catalonia, Spain between a tree and the astrophotographer's daughter.  These two planets will continue to stand out in the evening sky, toward the west, for the next few days, with a sliver of a crescent Moon and a fainter Saturn also visible nearby.  As November ends, Jupiter will sink lower into the sunset horizon with each subsequent night, while Venus will rise higher.  The next Jupiter-Venus conjunction will occur in early 2021.","venus, jupiter, horizon, bright, object, brightest, planet, night, passed, close, real, space, usual, orbit, time, planetary, captured, picturesque, sunset, llers, catalonia, spain, tree, astrophotographer, daughter, continue, stand, evening, west, next, sliver, crescent, moon, fainter, saturn, visible, nearby, november, sink, lower, subsequent, rise, higher, jupiter-venus, conjunction, early"
Hoag's Object: A Nearly Perfect Ring Galaxy,"Is this one galaxy or two?  This question came to light in 1950 when astronomer Arthur Hoag chanced upon this unusual extragalactic object.  On the outside is a ring dominated by bright blue stars, while near the center lies a ball of much redder stars that are likely much older.  Between the two is a gap that appears almost completely dark.  How Hoag's Object formed, including its nearly perfectly round ring of stars and gas, remains unknown.  Genesis hypotheses include a galaxy collision billions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a central bar that has since vanished. The featured photo was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and recently reprocessed using an artificially intelligent de-noising algorithm.  Observations in radio waves indicate that Hoag's Object has not accreted a smaller galaxy in the past billion years.  Hoag's Object spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 600 million light years away toward the constellation of the Snake (Serpens).  Many galaxies far in the distance are visible toward the right, while coincidentally, visible in the gap at about seven o'clock, is another but more distant ring galaxy.","hoag, object, perfect, ring, galaxy, question, came, light, astronomer, arthur, chanced, unusual, extragalactic, dominated, bright, blue, star, center, much, redder, older, appears, dark, formed, including, round, remains, unknown, genesis, hypothesis, include, collision, year, gravitational, effect, central, vanished, featured, photo, taken, hubble, space, telescope, reprocessed, using, intelligent, de-noising, algorithm, observation, radio, wave, indicate, accreted, smaller, span, constellation, snake, serpens, many, distance, visible, right, o'clock, distant"
Moon and Planets at Twilight,"This week's ongoing conjunction of Venus and Jupiter may have whetted your appetite for skygazing. Tonight is the main course though. On November 28, a young crescent Moon will join them posing next to the two bright planets above the western horizon at twilight. Much like tonight's visual feast, this night skyscape shows a young lunar crescent and brilliant Venus in the western evening twilight on October 29. The celestial beacons are setting over distant mountains and the Minya monastery, Ganzi Tibetan Autonomous Prefecture, Sichuan, China, planet Earth. Then Mercury, not Jupiter, was a celestial companion to Venus and the Moon.

Galileo's Europa Remastered,"Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft recorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered evidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides a deep, global ocean. Galileo's Europa image data has been remastered here, using improved new calibrations to produce a color image approximating what the human eye might see. Europa's long curving fractures hint at the subsurface liquid water.  The tidal flexing the large moon experiences in its elliptical orbit around Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid. But more tantalizing is the possibility that even in the absence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to support life, making Europa one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth. What kind of life could thrive in a deep, dark, subsurface ocean? Consider planet Earth's own extreme shrimp.","galileo, europa, remastered, looping, jovian, system, late, spacecraft, recorded, stunning, view, uncovered, evidence, moon, surface, likely, hide, deep, global, ocean, image, data, using, improved, calibration, produce, color, approximating, human, long, curving, fracture, hint, subsurface, liquid, water, tidal, flexing, large, experience, elliptical, orbit, jupiter, supply, energy, keep, tantalizing, possibility, absence, sunlight, process, support, life, making, best, place, look, earth, kind, thrive, dark, consider, planet, extreme, shrimp"
Star Trails for a Red Planet,"Does Mars have a north star? In long exposures of Earth's night sky, star trails make concentric arcs around the north celestial pole, the direction of our fair planet's axis of rotation. Bright star Polaris is presently the Earth's North Star, close on the sky to Earth's north celestial pole. But long exposures on Mars show star trails too, concentric arcs about a celestial pole determined by Mars' axis of rotation. Tilted like planet Earth's, the martian axis of rotation points in a different direction in space though. It points to a place on the sky between stars in Cygnus and Cepheus with no bright star comparable to Earth's north star Polaris nearby. So even though this ruddy, weathered landscape is remarkably reminiscent of terrain in images from the  martian surface, the view must be from planet Earth, with north star Polaris near the center of concentric star trails. The landforms in the foreground are found in Qinghai Province in northwestern China.","star, trail, planet, north, long, exposure, earth, night, make, concentric, celestial, pole, direction, fair, axis, rotation, bright, polaris, show, determined, tilted, martian, point, different, space, place, cygnus, cepheus, comparable, ruddy, weathered, landscape, reminiscent, terrain, image, surface, view, center, landforms, foreground, found, qinghai, province, northwestern, china"
Starburst Galaxy M94 from Hubble,"Why does this galaxy have a ring of bright blue stars?  Beautiful island universe Messier 94 lies a mere 15 million light-years distant in the northern constellation of the Hunting Dogs (Canes Venatici). A popular target for Earth-based astronomers, the face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across, with spiral arms sweeping through the outskirts of its broad disk. But this Hubble Space Telescope field of view spans about 7,000 light-years across M94's central region. The featured close-up highlights the galaxy's compact, bright nucleus, prominent inner dust lanes, and the remarkable bluish ring of young massive stars. The ring stars are all likely less than 10 million years old, indicating that M94 is a starburst galaxy that is experiencing an epoch of rapid star formation from inspiraling gas. The circular ripple of blue stars is likely a wave propagating outward, having been triggered by the gravity and rotation of a oval matter distributions. Because M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can better explore details of its starburst ring.

Mercury Crosses a Quiet Sun,"What's that black dot crossing the Sun? The planet Mercury. Mercury usually passes over or under the Sun, as seen from Earth, but last month the Solar System's innermost planet appeared to go just about straight across the middle.  Although witnessed by planet admirers across the globe, a particularly clear view was captured by the Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO) in Earth orbit. The featured video was captured by the SDO's HMI instrument in a broad range of visible light, and compresses the 5 1/2 hour transit into about 13 seconds.  The background Sun was unusually quiet -- even for being near Solar Minimum -- and showed no sunspots. The next solar transit by Mercury will occur in 2032.","mercury, cross, quiet, black, crossing, planet, pass, seen, earth, last, month, solar, system, innermost, appeared, straight, middle, witnessed, admirer, globe, clear, view, captured, dynamic, observatory, orbit, featured, video, instrument, broad, range, visible, light, compress, hour, transit, second, background, minimum, showed, sunspot, next"
M27: The Dumbbell Nebula,"Is this what will become of our Sun? Quite possibly.  The first hint of our Sun's future was discovered inadvertently in 1764. At that time, Charles Messier was compiling a list of diffuse objects not to be confused with comets. The 27th object on Messier's list, now known as M27 or the Dumbbell Nebula, is a planetary nebula, the type of nebula our Sun will produce when nuclear fusion stops in its core. M27 is one of the brightest planetary nebulae on the sky, and can be seen toward the constellation of the Fox (Vulpecula) with binoculars. It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27, featured here in colors emitted by hydrogen and oxygen. Understanding the physics and significance of M27 was well beyond 18th century science. Even today, many things remain mysterious about bipolar planetary nebula like M27, including the physical mechanism that expels a low-mass star's gaseous outer-envelope, leaving an X-ray hot white dwarf.

Electric Night,"It may appear, at first, like the Galaxy is producing the lightning, but really it's the Earth. The featured nighttime landscape was taken from a southern tip of the Italian Island of Sardinia in early June. The foreground rocks and shrubs are near the famous Capo Spartivento Lighthouse, and the camera is pointed south toward Algeria in Africa.  In the distance, across the Mediterranean Sea, a thunderstorm is threatening, with several electric lightning strokes caught together during this 25-second wide-angle exposure.  Much farther in the distance, strewn about the sky, are hundreds of stars in the neighborhood of our Sun in the Milky Way Galaxy.

Spiral Galaxy NGC 6744,"Beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 6744 is nearly 175,000 light-years across, larger than our own Milky Way. It lies some 30 million light-years distant in the southern constellation Pavo and appears as only a faint, extended object in small telescopes. We see the disk of the nearby island universe tilted towards our line of sight in this remarkably detailed galaxy portrait, a telescopic view that spans an area about the angular size of a full moon. In it, the giant galaxy's elongated yellowish core is dominated by the light from old, cool stars. Beyond the core, grand spiral arms are filled with young blue star clusters and speckled with pinkish star forming regions.

Pleiades to Hyades,"This cosmic vista stretches almost 20 degrees from top to bottom, across the dusty constellation Taurus. It begins at the Pleiades and ends at the Hyades, two star clusters recognized since antiquity in Earth's night sky. At top, the compact Pleiades star cluster is about 400 light-years away. The lovely grouping of young cluster stars shine through dusty clouds that scatter blue starlight. At bottom, the V-shaped Hyades cluster looks more spread out in comparison and lies much closer, 150 light-years away. The Hyades cluster stars seem anchored by bright Aldebaran, a red giant star with a yellowish appearance. But Aldebaran actually lies only 65 light-years distant and just by chance along the line of sight to the Hyades cluster. Faint and darkly obscuring dust clouds found near the edge of the Taurus Molecular Cloud are also evident throughout the celestial scene.

Lines of Time,"In time stars trace lines through the night sky on a rotating planet. Taken over two hours or more, these digitally added consecutive exposures were made with a camera and wide angle lens fixed to a tripod near Orel farm, Primorsky Krai, Russia, planet Earth. The stars trail in concentric arcs around the planet's south celestial pole below the scene's horizon, and north celestial pole off the frame at the upper right. Combined, the many short exposures also bring out the pretty star colours. Bluish trails are from stars hotter than Earth's Sun, while yellowish trails are from cooler stars.

Looking Sideways from the Parker Solar Probe,"verybody sees the Sun. Nobody's been there. Starting in 2018 though, NASA launched the robotic Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to investigate regions near to the Sun for the first time. The PSP's looping orbit brings it yet closer to the Sun each time around -- every few months. The featured time-lapse video shows the view looking sideways from behind PSP's Sun shield during its first approach to the Sun a year ago -- to about half the orbit of Mercury.  The PSP's Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) cameras took the images over nine days, but they are digitally compressed here into about 14 seconds.  The waving solar corona is visible on the far left, with stars, planets, and even the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy streaming by in the background as the PSP orbits the Sun. PSP has found the solar neighborhood to be surprisingly complex and to include switchbacks -- times when the Sun's magnetic field briefly reverses itself. The Sun is not only Earth's dominant energy source, its variable solar wind compresses Earth's atmosphere, triggers auroras, affects power grids, and can even damage orbiting communication satellites.","looking, sideways, parker, solar, probe, verybody, nobody, starting, nasa, launched, robotic, investigate, region, first, time, looping, orbit, brings, month, featured, time-lapse, video, show, view, shield, approach, year, half, mercury, wide, field, imager, wispr, camera, took, image, compressed, second, waving, corona, visible, left, star, planet, central, band, milky, galaxy, streaming, background, found, neighborhood, complex, include, switchbacks, magnetic, briefly, revers, earth, dominant, energy, source, variable, wind, compress, atmosphere, trigger, aurora, affect, power, grid, damage, orbiting, communication, satellite"
Starlink Satellite Trails over Brazil,"What are those streaks over the horizon? New Starlink satellites reflecting sunlight. SpaceX launched 60 Starlink communication satellites in May and 60 more in November. These satellites and thousands more are planned by communications companies in the next few years that may make streaks like these relatively common. Concern has been voiced by many in the astronomical community about how reflections from these satellites may affect future observations into space.  In the pictured composite of 33 exposures, parallel streaks from Starlink satellites are visible over southern Brazil. Sunflowers dot the foreground, while a bright meteor was caught by chance on the upper right. Satellite reflections are not new -- the constellation of 66 first-generation Iridium satellites launched starting 20 years ago produced some flares so bright that they could be seen during the day. Most of these old Iridium satellites, however, have been de-orbited over the past few years.

N63A: Supernova Remnant in Visible and X-ray,"What has this supernova left behind?  As little as 2,000 years ago, light from a massive stellar explosion in the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) first reached planet Earth. The LMC is a close galactic neighbor of our Milky Way Galaxy and the rampaging explosion front is now seen moving out - destroying or displacing ambient gas clouds while leaving behind relatively dense knots of gas and dust.  What remains is one of the largest supernova remnants in the LMC: N63A.  Many of the surviving dense knots have been themselves compressed and may further contract to form new stars.  Some of the resulting stars may then explode in a supernova, continuing the cycle.  Featured here is a combined image of N63A in the X-ray from the Chandra Space Telescope and in visible light by Hubble.  The prominent knot of gas and dust on the upper right -- informally dubbed the Firefox -- is very bright in visible light, while the larger supernova remnant shines most brightly in X-rays.  N63A spans over 25 light years and lies about 150,000 light years away toward the southern constellation of Dorado.","n63a, supernova, remnant, visible, x-ray, left, behind, little, year, light, massive, stellar, explosion, large, magellanic, cloud, reached, planet, earth, close, galactic, neighbor, milky, galaxy, rampaging, front, seen, moving, destroying, displacing, ambient, leaving, dense, knot, dust, remains, largest, many, surviving, compressed, contract, form, star, resulting, explode, continuing, cycle, featured, combined, image, chandra, space, telescope, hubble, prominent, upper, right, dubbed, firefox, bright, larger, shine, span, southern, constellation, dorado"
Decorating the Sky,"Bright stars, clouds of dust and glowing nebulae decorate this cosmic scene, a skyscape just north of Orion's belt. Close to the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the wide field view spans about 5.5 degrees. Striking bluish M78, a reflection nebula, is on the right. M78's tint is due to dust preferentially reflecting the blue light of hot, young stars. In colorful contrast, the red sash of glowing hydrogen gas sweeping through the center is part of the region's faint but extensive emission nebula known as Barnard's Loop. At lower left, a dark dust cloud forms a prominent silhouette cataloged as LDN 1622. While M78 and the complex Barnard's Loop are some 1,500 light-years away, LDN 1622 is likely to be much closer, only about 500 light-years distant from our fair planet Earth.","decorating, bright, star, cloud, dust, glowing, nebula, decorate, cosmic, scene, skyscape, north, orion, belt, plane, milky, galaxy, wide, field, view, span, degree, striking, bluish, reflection, right, tint, reflecting, blue, light, young, colorful, contrast, sash, hydrogen, sweeping, center, part, region, faint, extensive, emission, known, barnard, loop, left, dark, form, prominent, silhouette, cataloged, complex, light-year, much, closer, distant, fair, planet, earth"
Full Moon Geminids,"The dependable annual Geminid meteor shower will be near its peak tonight (December 13/14) and before tomorrow's dawn. As Earth crosses through the dusty trail of active asteroid 3200 Phaethon the meteors will flash through the sky from the shower's radiant in Gemini. Gemini will be pretty easy for skygazers to find too as it won't be far from a nearly full waning gibbous Moon. You don't have look at the shower's radiant to see meteors though. The almost full moonlight won't hide the brightest of the Geminids from view either, but it will substantially reduce the rate of visible meteors for those who are counting. In fact, the 2019 Geminids should look a lot like the 2016 meteor shower. This composite image from the 2016 Geminids aligns individual short exposures to capture many of the brighter Geminid meteors, inspite of a Full Moon shining near the constellation of the Twins.

Interstellar Comet 2I/Borisov,"From somewhere else in the Milky Way galaxy, Comet 2I/Borisov is just visiting the Solar System. Discovered by Crimean amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov on August 30, 2019, the first known interstellar comet is captured in these two recent Hubble Space Telescope images. On the left, a distant background galaxy near the line-of-sight to Borisov is blurred as Hubble tracked the speeding comet and dust tail about 327 million kilometers from Earth. At right, 2I/Borisov appears shortly after perihelion, its closest approach to Sun. Borisov's closest approach to our fair planet, a distance of about 290 million kilometers, will come on December 28. Even though Hubble's sharp images don't resolve the comet's nucleus, they do lead to estimates of less than 1 kilometer for its diameter.","interstellar, comet, milky, galaxy, visiting, solar, system, discovered, crimean, amateur, astronomer, gennady, borisov, first, known, captured, recent, hubble, space, telescope, image, left, distant, background, line-of-sight, blurred, tracked, speeding, dust, tail, kilometer, earth, appears, perihelion, closest, approach, fair, planet, distance, come, december, sharp, resolve, nucleus, lead, estimate, diameter"
Mammatus Clouds over Nebraska,"When do cloud bottoms appear like bubbles? Normally, cloud bottoms are flat. This is because moist warm air that rises and cools will condense into water droplets at a specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  As water droplets grow, an opaque cloud forms.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a thunderstorm.  Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  The mammatus clouds pictured here were photographed over Hastings, Nebraska during 2004 June.","mammatus, cloud, nebraska, bottom, appear, bubble, flat, moist, warm, rise, cool, condense, water, droplet, specific, temperature, corresponds, height, grow, opaque, form, condition, pocket, develop, contain, large, fall, clear, evaporate, occur, turbulent, thunderstorm, resulting, dramatic, sunlit, side, pictured, photographed, hastings, june"
The Magnetic Fields of Spiral Galaxy M77,"Can magnetic fields help tell us how spiral galaxies form and evolve?  To find out, the HAWC+ instrument on NASA's airborne (747) SOFIA observatory observed nearby spiral galaxy M77. HAWC+ maps magnetism by observing polarized infrared light emitted by elongated dust grains rotating in alignment with the local magnetic field.  The HAWC+ image shows that magnetic fields do appear to trace the spiral arms in the inner regions of M77, arms that likely highlight density waves in the inflowing gas, dust and stars caused by the gravity of the galaxy's oval shape. The featured picture superposes the HAWC+ image over diffuse X-ray emission mapped by NASA's NuSTAR satellite and visible light images taken by Hubble and the SDSS. M77 is located about 47 million light years away toward the constellation of the Sea Monster (Cetus).","magnetic, field, spiral, galaxy, help, tell, form, evolve, find, hawc+, instrument, nasa, airborne, sofia, observatory, observed, nearby, magnetism, observing, polarized, infrared, light, emitted, elongated, dust, grain, rotating, alignment, local, image, show, appear, trace, inner, region, highlight, density, wave, inflowing, star, caused, gravity, oval, shape, featured, picture, superposes, diffuse, x-ray, emission, mapped, nustar, satellite, visible, taken, hubble, sdss, located, year, constellation, monster, cetus"
The Horsehead Nebula,"Sculpted by stellar winds and radiation, a magnificent interstellar dust cloud by chance has assumed this recognizable shape.  Fittingly named the Horsehead Nebula, it is some 1,500 light-years distant, embedded in the vast Orion cloud complex. About five light-years ""tall"", the dark cloud is cataloged as Barnard 33 and is visible only because its obscuring dust is silhouetted against the glowing red emission nebula IC 434.  Stars are forming within the dark cloud. Contrasting blue reflection nebula NGC 2023, surrounding a hot, young star, is at the lower left of the full image.

A Hotspot Map of Neutron Star J0030's Surface,"What do neutron stars look like? Previously these city-sized stars were too small and too far away to resolve. Recently, however, the first maps of the locations and sizes of hotspots on a neutron star's surface have been made by carefully modeling how the rapid spin makes the star's X-ray brightness rise and fall.  Based on a leading model, an illustrative map of pulsar J0030+0451's hotspots is pictured, with the rest of the star's surface filled in with a false patchy blue.  J0030 spins once every 0.0049 seconds and is located about 1000 light years away. The map was computed from data taken by NASA's Neutron star Interior Composition ExploreR (NICER) X-ray telescope attached to the International Space Station.  The computed locations of these hotspots is surprising and not well understood. Because the gravitational lensing effect of neutron stars is so strong, J0300 displays more than half of its surface toward the Earth.  Studying the appearance of pulsars like J0030 allows accurate estimates of the neutron star's mass, radius, and the internal physics that keeps the star from imploding into a black hole.","hotspot, neutron, star, j0030, surface, look, city-sized, small, resolve, first, location, size, made, modeling, rapid, spin, make, x-ray, brightness, rise, fall, based, leading, model, illustrative, pulsar, j0030+0451, pictured, rest, filled, false, patchy, blue, second, located, light, year, computed, data, taken, nasa, interior, composition, explorer, telescope, attached, international, space, station, surprising, understood, gravitational, lensing, effect, strong, j0300, display, half, earth, studying, appearance, allows, accurate, estimate, mass, radius, internal, physic, keep, imploding, black, hole"
Apollo 17's Moonship,"Awkward and angular looking, Apollo 17's lunar module Challenger was designed for flight in the near vacuum of space.  Digitally enhanced and reprocessed, this picture taken from Apollo 17's command module America shows Challenger's ascent stage in lunar orbit. Small reaction control thrusters are at the sides of the moonship with the bell of the ascent rocket engine underneath. The hatch allowing access to the lunar surface is seen at the front, with a round radar antenna at the top. Mission commander Gene Cernan is clearly visible through the triangular window. This spaceship performed gracefully, landing on the Moon and returning the Apollo astronauts to the orbiting command module in December of 1972. So where is Challenger now? Its descent stage remains at the Apollo 17 landing site in the Taurus-Littrow valley. The ascent stage pictured was intentionally crashed nearby after being jettisoned from the command module prior to the astronauts' return to planet Earth. Apollo 17's mission came to an end 47 years ago today.

Solstice to Solstice Solargraph Timelapse,"The 2019 December Solstice, on the first day of winter in planet Earth's northern hemisphere and summer in the south, is at 4:19 Universal Time December 22. That's December 21 for North America, though. Celebrate with a timelapse animation of the Sun's seasonal progression through the sky. It was made with solargraph images from an ingenious array of 27 pinhole cameras. The first frame from the Solarcan camera matrix was recorded near December 21, 2018. The last frame in the series finished near June 21, 2019, the northern summer solstice. All 27 camera exposures were started at the same time, with a camera covered and removed from the array once a week. Viewed consecutively the pinhole camera pictures accumulate the traces of the Sun's daily path from winter (bottom) to summer (top) solstice.

Solstice Illuminated: A Year of Sky,"Can you find which day is the winter solstice?  Each panel shows one day. With 360 movie panels, the sky over (almost) an entire year is shown in time lapse format as recorded by a video camera on the roof of the Exploratorium museum in San Francisco, California. The camera recorded an image every 10 seconds from before sunrise to after sunset and from mid-2009 to mid-2010.  A time stamp showing the local time of day is provided on the lower right. The videos are arranged chronologically, with July 28 shown on the upper left, and January 1 located about half way down.  In the videos, darkness indicates night, blue depicts clear day, while gray portrays pervasive daytime cloud cover. Many videos show complex patterns of clouds moving across the camera's wide field as that day progresses. The initial darkness in the middle depicts the delayed dawn and fewer daylight hours of winter. Although every day lasts 24 hours, nighttime lasts longest in the northern hemisphere in December and the surrounding winter months. Therefore, finding the panel with the longest night will locate the day of winter solstice -- which happens to be today in the northern hemisphere.  As the videos collectively end, sunset and then darkness descend first on the winter days just above the middle, and last on the mid-summer near the bottom.

Places for OSIRIS-REx to Touch Asteroid Bennu,"Where is the best place to collect a surface sample from asteroid Bennu?  Launched in 2016, NASA sent the robotic Origins, Spectral Interpretation, Resource Identification, Security, Regolith Explorer (OSIRIS-REx) to investigate the 500-meter-across asteroid 101955 Bennu. After mapping the near-Earth asteroid's dark surface, OSIRIS-REx will next touch Bennu's surface in 2020 August to collect a surface sample.  The featured 23-second time-lapse video shows four candidate locations for the touch, from which NASA chose just one earlier this month. NASA chose the Nightingale near Bennu's northern hemisphere as the primary touch-down spot because of its relative flatness, lack of boulders, and apparent abundance of fine-grained sand.

An Annular Solar Eclipse over New Mexico,"What is this person doing?  In 2012 an annular eclipse of the Sun was visible over a narrow path that crossed the northern Pacific Ocean and several western US states.  In an annular solar eclipse, the Moon is too far from the Earth to block out the entire Sun, leaving the Sun peeking out over the Moon's disk in a ring of fire.  To capture this unusual solar event, an industrious photographer drove from Arizona to New Mexico to find just the right vista. After setting up and just as the eclipsed Sun was setting over a ridge about 0.5 kilometers away, a person unknowingly walked right into the shot. Although grateful for the unexpected human element, the photographer never learned the identity of the silhouetted interloper. It appears likely, though, that the person is holding a circular device that would enable them to get their own view of the eclipse.  The shot was taken at sunset on 2012 May 20 at 7:36 pm local time from a park near Albuquerque, New Mexico, USA. Tomorrow another annular solar eclipse will become visible, this time along a thin path starting in Saudi Arabia and going through southern India, Singapore, and Guam.

Cosy mountain cabins in the snowy foreground are near the village of Oravska Lesna, Slovakia. The shining celestial beacons marking the well-known asterism are Aldebaran, Capella, Pollux (and Castor), Procyon, Rigel, and Sirius.

A Partial Solar Eclipse Sequence Reflected,"What's happened to the Sun?  Yesterday, if you were in the right place at the right time, you could see the Sun rise partially eclipsed by the Moon. The unusual sight was captured in dramatic fashion in the featured image not only directly, in a sequence of six images, but also in reflection from Soltan Salt Lake in Iran. The almost-white Sun appears dimmer and redder near the horizon primarily because Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatters away more blue light.  Yesterday's partial solar eclipse appeared in the sky over much of Asia and Australia, but those with a clear enough sky in a thin band across the Earth's surface were treated to a more complete annular solar eclipse -- where the Moon appears completely surrounded by the Sun in what is known as a ring of fire. The next annular solar eclipse will occur in 2020 June.

A Distorted Sunrise Eclipse,"Yes, but have you ever seen a sunrise like this?  Here, after initial cloudiness, the Sun appeared to rise in two pieces and during partial eclipse, causing the photographer to describe it as the most stunning sunrise of his life.  The dark circle near the top of the atmospherically-reddened Sun is the Moon -- but so is the dark peak just below it.  This is because along the way, the Earth's atmosphere had a layer of unusually warm air over the sea which acted like a gigantic lens and created a second image.  For a normal sunrise or sunset, this rare phenomenon of atmospheric optics is known as the Etruscan vase effect. The featured picture was captured two mornings ago from Al Wakrah, Qatar.  Some observers in a narrow band of Earth to the east were able to see a full annular solar eclipse -- where the Moon appears completely surrounded by the background Sun in a ring of fire.  The next solar eclipse, also an annular eclipse, will occur in 2020 June.

Cassini Spacecraft Crosses Saturn's Ring Plane,"If this is Saturn, where are the rings?  When Saturn's ""appendages"" disappeared in 1612, Galileo did not understand why.   Later that century, it became understood that Saturn's unusual protrusions were rings and that when the Earth crosses the ring plane, the edge-on rings will appear to disappear.  This is because Saturn's rings are confined to a plane many times thinner, in proportion, than a razor blade.  In modern times, the robot Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn frequently crossed Saturn's ring plane during its mission to Saturn, from 2004 to 2017.  A series of plane crossing images from 2005 February was dug out of the vast online Cassini raw image archive by interested Spanish amateur Fernando Garcia Navarro.  Pictured here, digitally cropped and set in representative colors, is the striking result.  Saturn's thin ring plane appears in blue, bands and clouds in Saturn's upper atmosphere appear in gold. Details of Saturn's rings can be seen in the high dark shadows across the top of this image, taken back in 2005. The moons Dione and Enceladus appear as bumps in the rings.

Messier 20 and 21,"The beautiful Trifid Nebula, also known as Messier 20, is easy to find with a small telescope in the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. About 5,000 light-years away, the colorful study in cosmic contrasts shares this well-composed, nearly 1 degree wide field with open star cluster Messier 21 (top left). Trisected by dust lanes the Trifid itself is about 40 light-years across and a mere 300,000 years old. That makes it one of the youngest star forming regions in our sky, with newborn and embryonic stars embedded in its natal dust and gas clouds. Estimates of the distance to open star cluster M21 are similar to M20's, but though they share this gorgeous telescopic skyscape there is no apparent connection between the two. In fact, M21's stars are much older, about 8 million years old.","beautiful, trifid, nebula, known, easy, find, small, telescope, rich, constellation, sagittarius, light-year, colorful, study, cosmic, contrast, share, well-composed, degree, wide, field, open, star, cluster, left, trisected, dust, lane, year, make, youngest, forming, region, newborn, embryonic, embedded, natal, cloud, estimate, distance, similar, gorgeous, telescopic, skyscape, apparent, connection, fact, much, older"

About 3 million light-years from the Milky Way, M33 is itself thought to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy and astronomers in these two galaxies would likely have spectacular views of each other's grand spiral star systems. As for the view from planet Earth, this sharp image shows off M33's blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along the galaxy's loosely wound spiral arms. In fact, the cavernous NGC 604 is the brightest star forming region, seen here at about the 7 o'clock position from the galaxy center. Like M31, M33's population of well-measured variable stars have helped make this nearby spiral a cosmic yardstick for establishing the distance scale of the Universe.","triangulum, galaxy, small, northern, constellation, harbor, magnificent, face-on, spiral, popular, name, include, pinwheel, light-year, diameter, third, largest, local, group, milky, thought, andromeda, astronomer, spectacular, view, grand, star, system, planet, earth, sharp, image, show, blue, cluster, pinkish, forming, region, wound, fact, cavernous, brightest, seen, o'clock, position, center, population, well-measured, variable, helped, make, nearby, cosmic, yardstick, establishing, distance, scale, universe"
Betelgeuse Imagined,"Why is Betelgeuse fading?  No one knows.  Betelgeuse, one of the brightest and most recognized stars in the night sky, is only half as bright as it used to be only five months ago.  Such variability is likely just  normal behavior for this famously variable supergiant, but the recent dimming has rekindled discussion on how long it may be before Betelgeuse does go supernova.  Known for its red color, Betelgeuse is one of the few stars to be resolved by modern telescopes, although only barely.  The featured artist's illustration imagines how Betelgeuse might look up close. Betelgeuse is thought to have a complex and tumultuous surface that frequently throws impressive flares.  Were it to replace the Sun (not recommended), its surface would extend out near the orbit of Jupiter, while gas plumes would bubble out past Neptune.  Since Betelgeuse is about 700 light years away, its eventual supernova will not endanger life on Earth even though its brightness may rival that of a full Moon.  Astronomers -- both amateur and professional -- will surely continue to monitor Betelgeuse as this new decade unfolds.

The Fainting of Betelgeuse,"Begirt with many a blazing star, Orion the Hunter is one of the most recognizable constellations. In this night skyscape the Hunter's stars rise in the northern hemisphere's winter sky on December 30, 2019, tangled in bare trees near Newnan, Georgia, USA. Red supergiant star Betelgeuse stands out in yellowish hues at Orion's shoulder left of center, but it no longer so strongly rivals the blue supergiant star Rigel at the Hunter's foot. In fact, skygazers around planet Earth can see a strikingly fainter Betelgeuse now, its brightness fading by more than half in the final months of 2019. Betelgeuse has long been known to be a variable star, changing its brightness in multiple cycles with approximate short and long term periods of hundreds of days to many years. The star is now close to its faintest since photometric measurements in 1926/27, likely due in part to a near coincidence in the minimum of short and long term cycles. Betelgeuse is also recognized as a nearby red supergiant star that will end its life in a core collapse supernova explosion sometime in the next 100,000 years, though that cosmic cataclysm will take place a safe 700 light-years or so from our fair planet.","fainting, betelgeuse, begirt, many, blazing, star, orion, hunter, recognizable, constellation, night, skyscape, rise, northern, hemisphere, winter, december, tangled, bare, tree, newnan, georgia, supergiant, stand, yellowish, shoulder, left, center, rival, blue, rigel, foot, fact, skygazers, planet, earth, fainter, brightness, fading, half, final, month, known, variable, changing, multiple, cycle, approximate, short, long, term, period, hundred, year, faintest, photometric, measurement, likely, part, coincidence, minimum, recognized, life, core, collapse, supernova, explosion, next, cosmic, cataclysm, take, place, safe, light-year, fair"
Quadrantids over the Great Wall,"Named for a forgotten constellation, the Quadrantid Meteor Shower is an annual event for planet Earth's northern hemisphere skygazers The shower's radiant on the sky lies within the old, astronomically obsolete constellation Quadrans Muralis. That location is not far from the Big Dipper, at the boundaries of the modern constellations Bootes and Draco. With the radiant out of the frame at the upper right, Quadrantid meteors streak through this night skyscape composed of digital frames recorded in the hours around the shower's peak on January 4, 2013. The last quarter moon illuminates rugged terrain and a section of the Great Wall in Hebei Province, China. A likely source of the dust stream that produces Quadrantid meteors was identified in 2003 as an asteroid. As usual, in 2020 the shower is expected to peak briefly on the night of January 3/4. Meteor fans in North America can anticipate a good show to celebrate the new year in moonless skies before tomorrow's dawn.

Aurora Slathers Up the Sky,"Like salsa verde on your favorite burrito, a green aurora slathers up the sky in this 2017 June 25 snapshot from the International Space Station. About 400 kilometers (250 miles) above Earth, the orbiting station is itself within the upper realm of the auroral displays. Aurorae have the signature colors of excited molecules and atoms at the low densities found at extreme altitudes. Emission from atomic oxygen dominates this view. The tantalizing glow is green at lower altitudes, but rarer reddish bands extend above the space station's horizon. The orbital scene was captured while passing over a point south and east of Australia, with stars above the horizon at the right belonging to the constellation Canis Major, Orion's big dog. Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major, is the brightest star near the Earth's limb.","aurora, slathers, salsa, favorite, burrito, green, june, snapshot, international, space, station, kilometer, mile, earth, orbiting, upper, realm, auroral, display, signature, color, excited, molecule, density, found, extreme, altitude, emission, atomic, oxygen, dominates, view, tantalizing, glow, lower, rarer, reddish, band, extend, horizon, orbital, scene, captured, passing, point, south, east, australia, star, belonging, constellation, canis, major, orion, sirius, alpha, brightest, limb"
A Starry Night of Iceland,"On some nights, the sky is the best show in town. On this night, the sky was not only the best show in town, but a composite image of the sky won an international competition for landscape astrophotography. The featured winning image was taken in 2011 over J�kuls�rl�n, the largest glacial lake in Iceland.  The photographer combined six exposures to capture not only two green auroral rings, but their reflections off the serene lake. Visible in the distant background sky is the band of our Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda galaxy. A powerful coronal mass ejection from the Sun caused auroras to be seen as far south as Wisconsin, USA.  As the Sun progresses away from its current low in surface activity toward a solar maximum a few years away, many more spectacular images of aurora are expected.","starry, night, iceland, best, show, town, composite, image, international, competition, landscape, astrophotography, featured, winning, taken, j�kuls�rl�n, largest, glacial, lake, photographer, combined, exposure, capture, green, auroral, ring, reflection, serene, visible, distant, background, band, milky, galaxy, andromeda, powerful, coronal, mass, ejection, caused, aurora, seen, south, wisconsin, progress, current, surface, activity, solar, maximum, year, many, spectacular, expected"
Tumultuous Clouds of Jupiter,"Some cloud patterns on Jupiter are quite complex. The featured tumultuous clouds were captured in May by NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft currently orbiting our Solar System's largest planet.  The image was taken when Juno was only about 15,000 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops, so close that less than half of the giant planet is visible.  The rough white clouds on the far right are high altitude clouds known as pop-up clouds.  Juno's mission, now extended into 2021, is to study Jupiter in new ways. Among many other things, Juno has been measuring Jupiter's gravitational field, finding surprising evidence that Jupiter may be mostly a liquid.","tumultuous, cloud, jupiter, pattern, complex, featured, captured, nasa, robotic, juno, spacecraft, orbiting, solar, system, largest, planet, image, taken, kilometer, half, giant, visible, rough, white, high, altitude, known, pop-up, mission, extended, study, many, thing, measuring, gravitational, field, finding, surprising, evidence, liquid"
IC 405: The Flaming Star Nebula,"Rippling dust and gas lanes give the Flaming Star Nebula its name.  The orange and purple colors of the nebula are present in different regions and are created by different processes.  The bright star AE Aurigae, visible toward the image left, is so hot it is blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas.  When a proton recaptures an electron, red light is frequently emitted (depicted here in orange). The purple region's color is a mix of this red light and blue light emitted by AE Aurigae but reflected to us by surrounding dust. The two regions are referred to as emission nebula and reflection nebula, respectively.  Pictured here in the Hubble color palette, the Flaming Star Nebula, officially known as IC 405, lies about 1500 light years distant, spans about 5 light years, and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga).","flaming, star, nebula, rippling, dust, lane, give, name, orange, purple, color, present, different, region, created, process, bright, aurigae, visible, image, left, blue, emitting, light, energetic, knock, electron, surrounding, proton, recapture, emitted, depicted, reflected, referred, emission, reflection, pictured, hubble, palette, known, year, distant, span, small, telescope, constellation, charioteer, auriga"
Galaxies in the River,"Large galaxies grow by eating small ones. Even our own galaxy engages in a sort of galactic cannibalism, absorbing small galaxies that are too close and are captured by the Milky Way's gravity. In fact, the practice is common in the universe and illustrated by this striking pair of interacting galaxies from the banks of the southern constellation Eridanus, The River. Located over 50 million light years away, the large, distorted spiral NGC 1532 is seen locked in a gravitational struggle with dwarf galaxy NGC 1531 (right of center), a struggle the smaller galaxy will eventually lose. Seen edge-on, spiral NGC 1532 spans about 100,000 light-years. Nicely detailed in this sharp image, the NGC 1532/1531 pair is thought to be similar to the well-studied system of face-on spiral and small companion known as M51.","galaxy, river, large, grow, eating, small, engages, sort, galactic, cannibalism, absorbing, captured, milky, gravity, fact, practice, common, universe, illustrated, striking, pair, interacting, bank, southern, constellation, eridanus, located, light, year, distorted, spiral, seen, locked, gravitational, struggle, dwarf, right, center, smaller, lose, edge-on, span, light-year, detailed, sharp, image, thought, similar, well-studied, system, face-on, companion, known"
Perihelion to Aphelion,"Perihelion for 2020, the point in Earth's elliptical orbit when it is closest to the Sun, occurred on January 5th. The distance from the Sun doesn't determine the seasons, though. Those are governed by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation, so January is still winter in the north and summer in southern hemisphere. But it does mean that on January 5 the Sun was at its largest apparent size. This composite neatly compares two pictures of the Sun, both taken from planet Earth with the same telescope and camera. The left half was captured on the date of the 2020 perihelion. The right was recorded only a week before the July 4 date of the 2019 aphelion, the farthest point in Earth's orbit. Otherwise difficult to notice, the change in the Sun's apparent diameter between perihelion and aphelion amounts to a little over 3 percent. The 2020 perihelion and the preceding 2019 aphelion correspond to the closest and farthest perihelion and aphelion of the 21st century.","perihelion, aphelion, point, earth, elliptical, orbit, closest, occurred, january, distance, determine, season, governed, tilt, axis, rotation, north, summer, southern, mean, largest, apparent, size, composite, compare, picture, taken, planet, telescope, camera, left, half, captured, date, recorded, week, farthest, difficult, notice, change, diameter, amount, little, percent, preceding, correspond, century"
Nacreous Clouds over Sweden,"Vivid and lustrous, wafting iridescent waves of color filled this mountain and skyscape near Tanndalen, Sweden on January 3. Known as nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, they are rare. This northern winter season they have been making unforgettable appearances at high latitudes, though. A type of polar stratospheric cloud, they form when unusually cold temperatures in the usually cloudless lower stratosphere form ice crystals. Still sunlit at altitudes of around 15 to 25 kilometers the clouds can diffract sunlight after sunset and before the dawn.","nacreous, cloud, sweden, vivid, lustrous, wafting, iridescent, wave, color, filled, mountain, skyscape, tanndalen, january, known, mother-of-pearl, rare, northern, winter, season, making, unforgettable, appearance, high, latitude, type, polar, stratospheric, form, cold, temperature, cloudless, lower, stratosphere, crystal, sunlit, altitude, kilometer, diffract, sunlight, sunset, dawn"
NGC 602 and Beyond,"Near the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy some 200 thousand light-years distant, lies 5 million year young star cluster NGC 602. Surrounded by natal gas and dust, NGC 602 is featured in this stunning Hubble image of the region, augmented by images in the X-ray by Chandra,  and in the infrared by Spitzer. Fantastic ridges and swept back shapes strongly suggest that energetic radiation and shock waves from NGC 602's massive young stars have eroded the dusty material and triggered a progression of star formation moving away from the cluster's center. At the estimated distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud, the Picture spans about 200 light-years, but a tantalizing assortment of background galaxies are also visible in this sharp multi-colored view.

Stars and Dust in Corona Australis,"Cosmic dust clouds and young, energetic stars inhabit this telescopic vista, less than 500 light-years away toward the northern boundary of Corona Australis, the Southern Crown. The dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way. But the striking complex of reflection nebulae cataloged as NGC 6726, 6727, and IC 4812 produce a characteristic blue color as light from the region's young hot stars is reflected by the cosmic dust. The dust also obscures from view stars still in the process of formation. At the left, smaller yellowish nebula NGC 6729 bends around young variable star R Coronae Australis. Just below it, glowing arcs and loops shocked by outflows from embedded newborn stars are identified as Herbig-Haro objects. On the sky this field of view spans about 1 degree. That corresponds to almost 9 light-years at the estimated distance of the nearby star forming region.

A Desert Eclipse,"A good place to see a ring-of-fire eclipse, it seemed, would be from a desert. In a desert, there should be relatively few obscuring clouds and trees.  Therefore late last December a group of photographers traveled to the United Arab Emirates and Rub al-Khali, the largest continuous sand desert in world, to capture clear images of an unusual eclipse that would be passing over.  A ring-of-fire eclipse is an annular eclipse that occurs when the Moon is far enough away on its elliptical orbit around the Earth so that it appears too small, angularly, to cover the entire Sun. At the maximum of an annular eclipse, the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun. This particular eclipse, they knew, would peak soon after sunrise.  After seeking out such a dry and barren place, it turned out that some of the most interesting eclipse images actually included a tree in the foreground, because, in addition to the sand dunes, the tree gave the surreal background a contrasting sense of normalcy, scale, and texture.

Evidence of an Active Volcano on Venus,"Are volcanoes still active on Venus?  More volcanoes are known on Venus than Earth, but when Venusian volcanoes last erupted is not directly known. Evidence bolstering very recent volcanism on Venus has recently been uncovered, though, right here on Earth. Lab results showed that images of surface lava would become dim in the infrared in only months in the dense Venusian atmosphere, a dimming not seen in ESA's Venus Express images. Venus Express entered orbit around Venus in 2006 and remained in contact with Earth until 2014. Therefore, the infrared glow (shown in false-color red) recorded by Venus Express for Idunn Mons and featured here on a NASA Magellan image indicates that this volcano erupted very recently -- and is still active today.  Understanding the volcanics of Venus might lead to insight about the volcanics on Earth, as well as elsewhere in our Solar System.

Iridescent Clouds over Sweden,"Why would these clouds multi-colored?  A relatively rare phenomenon in clouds known as iridescence can bring up unusual colors vividly or even a whole spectrum of colors simultaneously. These polar stratospheric clouds clouds, also known as nacreous and mother-of-pearl clouds,  are formed of small water droplets of nearly uniform size. When the Sun is in the right position and, typically, hidden from direct view, these thin clouds can be seen significantly diffracting sunlight in a nearly coherent manner, with different colors being deflected by different amounts. Therefore, different colors will come to the observer from slightly different directions. Many clouds start with uniform regions that could show iridescence but quickly become too thick, too mixed, or too angularly far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors.

NGC 247 and Friends,"About 70,000 light-years across, NGC 247 is a spiral galaxy smaller than our Milky Way. Measured to be only 11 million light-years distant it is nearby though. Tilted nearly edge-on as seen from our perspective, it dominates this telescopic field of view toward the southern constellation Cetus. The pronounced void on one side of the galaxy's disk recalls for some its popular name, the Needle's Eye galaxy. Many background galaxies are visible in this sharp galaxy portrait, including the remarkable string of four galaxies just below and left of NGC 247 known as Burbidge's Chain.

Apollo 17: A Stereo View from Lunar Orbit,"Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this awesome stereo view of another world. The scene was recorded by Apollo 17 mission commander Eugene Cernan on December 11, 1972, one orbit before descending to land on the Moon. The stereo anaglyph was assembled from two photographs (AS17-147-22465, AS17-147-22466) captured from his vantage point on board the Lunar Module Challenger as he and Dr. Harrison Schmitt flew over Apollo 17's landing site in the Taurus-Littrow Valley.

An Almost Eclipse of the Moon,"This composited series of images follows the Moon on January 10, the first Full Moon of 2020, in Hungarian skies. The lunar disk is in mid-eclipse at the center of the sequence though. It looks only slightly darker there as it passes through the light outer shadow or penumbra of planet Earth. In fact during this penumbral lunar eclipse the Moon almost crossed into the northern edge of Earth's dark central shadow or umbra. Subtle and hard to see, this penumbral lunar eclipse was the first of four lunar eclipses in 2020, all of which will be penumbral lunar eclipses.","eclipse, moon, composited, series, image, follows, january, first, full, hungarian, lunar, disk, mid-eclipse, center, sequence, look, darker, pass, light, outer, shadow, penumbra, planet, earth, fact, penumbral, crossed, northern, edge, dark, central, umbra, subtle, hard"
M1: The Incredible Expanding Crab Nebula,"Are your eyes good enough to see the Crab Nebula expand?  The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first on Charles Messier's famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across today, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of over 1,000 kilometers per second. Over the past decade, its expansion has been documented in this stunning time-lapse movie. In each year from 2008 to 2017, an image was produced with the same telescope and camera from a remote observatory in Austria. Combined in the time-lapse movie, the 10 images represent 32 hours of total integration time. The sharp, processed frames even reveal the dynamic energetic emission within the incredible expanding Crab. The Crab Nebula lies about 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.

Quadrantid Meteors through Orion,"Why are these meteor trails nearly parallel? Because they were all shed by the same space rock and so can be traced back to the same direction on the sky: the radiant of the Quadrantid Meteor Shower.  This direction used to be toward the old constellation of Quadrans Muralis, hence the name Quadrantids, but when the International Astronomical Union formulated its list of modern constellations in 1922, this constellation did not make the list. Even though the meteors are now considered to originate from the recognized constellation of Bootes, the old name stuck. Regardless of the designation, every January the Earth moves through a dust stream and bits of this dust glow as meteors as they heat up in Earth's atmosphere.  The featured image composite was taken on January 4 with a picturesque snowy Slovakian landscape in the foreground, and a deep-exposure sky prominently featuring the constellation Orion in the background.

Parker: Sounds of the Solar Wind,"What does the solar wind sound like? A wind of fast moving particles blows out from our Sun, and although space transmits sound poorly, particle impact and variable-field data from NASA's near-Sun Parker Solar Probe is being translated into  sound. The disarming audio track of the featured video recounts several of these reverberations, including spooky-sounding Langmuir Waves (heard first), hurricane-sounding Whistler Mode Waves (heard next), and hard-to-describe Dispersive Chirping Waves (heard last). Also impressive is the video's time-lapse visual track which shows Parker's view to the side of its sun shield, and where the planets Earth, Jupiter, Mercury and Venus appear in succession, interspersed with bursts of powerful cosmic rays impacting the imager.

The Hyades Star Cluster,"It is the closest cluster of stars to the Sun. The Hyades open cluster is bright enough to have been remarked on even thousands of years ago, yet is not as bright or compact as the nearby Pleiades (M45) star cluster. Pictured here is a particularly deep image of the Hyades which has brings out vivid star colors and faint coincidental nebulas.  The brightest star in the field is yellow Aldebaran, the eye of the bull toward the constellation of Taurus. Aldebaran, at 65 light-years away, is now known to be unrelated to the Hyades cluster, which lies about 150 light-years away.  The central Hyades stars are spread out over about 15 light-years. Formed about 625 million years ago, the Hyades likely shares a common origin with the Beehive cluster (M44), a naked-eye open star cluster toward the constellation of Cancer, based on M44's motion through space and remarkably similar age.","hyades, star, cluster, closest, open, bright, remarked, year, compact, nearby, pleiades, pictured, deep, image, brings, vivid, color, faint, coincidental, nebula, brightest, field, yellow, aldebaran, bull, constellation, taurus, light-year, known, unrelated, central, spread, formed, likely, share, common, origin, beehive, naked-eye, cancer, based, motion, space, similar"
Globular Star Cluster NGC 6752,"Some 13,000 light-years away toward the southern constellation Pavo, the globular star cluster NGC 6752 roams the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Over 10 billion years old, NGC 6752 follows clusters Omega Centauri and 47 Tucanae as the third brightest globular in planet Earth's night sky. It holds over 100 thousand stars in a sphere about 100 light-years in diameter. Telescopic explorations of the NGC 6752 have found that a remarkable fraction of the stars near the cluster's core, are multiple star systems. They also reveal the presence of blue straggle stars, stars which appear to be too young and massive to exist in a cluster whose stars are all expected to be at least twice as old as the Sun. The blue stragglers are thought to be formed by star mergers and collisions in the dense stellar environment at the cluster's core. This sharp color composite also features the cluster's ancient red giant stars in yellowish hues. (Note: The bright, spiky blue star at 11 o'clock from the cluster center is a foreground star along the line-of-sight to NGC 6752)","globular, star, cluster, light-year, southern, constellation, pavo, roams, halo, milky, year, follows, omega, centauri, tucanae, third, brightest, planet, earth, night, hold, diameter, telescopic, exploration, found, remarkable, fraction, core, multiple, system, reveal, presence, blue, straggle, appear, young, massive, exist, expected, least, straggler, thought, formed, merger, collision, dense, stellar, environment, sharp, color, composite, feature, ancient, giant, yellowish, note, bright, spiky, center, foreground, line-of-sight"
Into the  Shadow,"On January 21, 2019 moonwatchers on planet Earth saw a total lunar eclipse. In 35 frames this composite image follows the Moon that night as it crossed into Earth's dark umbral shadow. Taken 3 minutes apart, they almost melt together in a continuous screen that captures the dark colors within the shadow itself and the northern curve of the shadow's edge. Sunlight scattered by the atmosphere into the shadow causes the lunar surface to appear reddened during totality (left), but close to the umbra's edge, the limb of the eclipsed Moon shows a remarkable blue hue. The blue eclipsed moonlight originates as rays of sunlight pass through layers high in Earth's upper stratosphere, colored by ozone that scatters red light and transmits blue.  The Moon's next crossing into Earth's umbral shadow, will be on May 26, 2021.","shadow, january, moonwatchers, planet, earth, total, lunar, eclipse, frame, composite, image, follows, night, crossed, dark, umbral, taken, minute, melt, continuous, screen, capture, color, northern, curve, edge, sunlight, scattered, cause, surface, appear, reddened, totality, left, close, umbra, limb, eclipsed, moon, show, remarkable, blue, moonlight, originates, layer, high, upper, colored, ozone, scatter, light, transmits, next, crossing"
Rubin's Galaxy,"In this Hubble Space Telescope image the bright, spiky stars lie in the foreground toward the heroic northern constellation Perseus and well within our own Milky Way galaxy. In sharp focus beyond is UGC 2885, a giant spiral galaxy about 232 million light-years distant. Some 800,000 light-years across compared to the Milky Way's diameter of 100,000 light-years or so, it has around 1 trillion stars. That's about 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way. Part of a current investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of astronomer Vera Rubin's pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies. Her work was the first to convincingly demonstrate the dominating presence of dark matter in our universe.","rubin, galaxy, hubble, space, telescope, image, bright, spiky, star, foreground, heroic, northern, constellation, perseus, milky, sharp, focus, giant, spiral, light-year, distant, compared, diameter, time, many, part, current, investigation, understand, grow, enormous, size, astronomer, vera, pioneering, study, rotation, work, demonstrate, dominating, presence, dark, matter, universe"
"Hills, Ridges, and Tracks on Mars","Sometimes, even rovers on Mars stop to admire the scenery. Just late last November the Curiosity rover on Mars paused to photograph its impressive surroundings. One thing to admire, straight ahead, was Central Butte, an unusual flat hill studied by Curiosity just a few days before this image was taken. To its right was distant Mount Sharp, the five-kilometer central peak of entire Gale crater, the interior of which Curiosity is exploring. Mount Sharp, covered in sulfates, appears quite bright in this colorized, red-filtered image. To the far left, shrouded in a very dark shadow, was the south slope of Vera Rubin ridge, an elevation explored previously by Curiosity.  Between the ridge and butte were tracks left by Curiosity's wheels as they rolled forward, out of the scene. In the image foreground is, of course, humanity's current eyes on Mars: the complex robotic rover Curiosity itself.  Later this year, if all goes well, NASA will have another rover -- and more eyes -- on Mars.

Comet CG Evaporates,"Where do comet tails come from?  There are no obvious places on the nuclei of comets from which the jets that create comet tails emanate.  One of the best images of emerging jets is shown in the featured picture, taken in 2015 by ESA's robotic Rosetta spacecraft that orbited Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (Comet CG) from 2014 to 2016.  The picture shows plumes of gas and dust escaping numerous places from Comet CG's nucleus as it neared the Sun and heated up.  The comet has two prominent lobes, the larger one spanning about 4 kilometers, and a smaller 2.5-kilometer lobe connected by a narrow neck. Analyses indicate that evaporation must be taking place well inside the comet's surface to create the jets of dust and ice that we see emitted through the surface.  Comet CG (also known as Comet 67P) loses in jets about a meter of radius during each of its 6.44-year orbits around the Sun, a rate at which will completely destroy the comet in only thousands of years. In 2016, Rosetta's mission ended with a controlled impact onto Comet CG's surface.

Star Formation in the Tadpole Nebula,"What's all of the commotion in the Tadpole Nebula? Star formation.  Dusty emission in the Tadpole Nebula, IC 410, lies about 12,000 light-years away in the northern constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga). The cloud of glowing gas is over 100 light-years across, sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from embedded open star cluster NGC 1893. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, bright newly formed cluster stars are seen all around the star-forming nebula.  Notable near the image center are two relatively dense streamers of material trailing away from the nebula's central regions. Potentially sites of ongoing star formation in IC 410, these cosmic tadpole shapes are about 10 light-years long. The featured image was taken in infrared light by NASA's Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) satellite.

Milky Way over Yellowstone,"The Milky Way was not created by an evaporating lake. The pool of vivid blue water, about 10 meters across, is known as Silex Spring and is located in Yellowstone National Park in Wyoming, USA. Steam rises off the spring, heated by a magma chamber deep underneath known as the Yellowstone hotspot.  The steam blurs the image of Jupiter, making it seem unusually large.  Unrelated and far in the distance, the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy rises high overhead, a band lit by billions of stars.  The featured picture is a 3-image panorama taken last August.  If the Yellowstone hotspot causes another supervolcanic eruption as it did 640,000 years ago, a large part of North America would be affected.","milky, yellowstone, created, evaporating, lake, pool, vivid, blue, water, meter, known, silex, spring, located, national, park, wyoming, steam, rise, heated, magma, chamber, deep, underneath, hotspot, blur, image, jupiter, making, seem, large, unrelated, distance, central, band, galaxy, high, overhead, star, featured, picture, 3-image, panorama, taken, last, august, cause, supervolcanic, eruption, year, part, north, america, affected"
Two Clusters and a Comet,"This lovely starfield spans some four full moons (about 2 degrees) across the heroic northern constellation of Perseus. In telescopic exposures made during the nights of January 24, 26, and 28 it holds the famous pair of open or galactic star clusters h and Chi Persei with comet PanSTARRS (C/2017 T2) captured each night as it swept left to right across the field of view. Also cataloged as NGC 869 (right) and NGC 884, both star clusters are about 7,000 light-years away and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  Separated by only a few hundred light-years, the clusters are both 13 million years young based on the ages of their individual stars, evidence that they were likely a product of the same star-forming region. Discovered in 2017 while still beyond the orbit of Saturn, Comet PanSTARRs is a new visitor to the inner solar system and just over 13 light-minutes from planet Earth. Always a rewarding sight in binoculars, the Double Cluster is even visible to the unaided eye from dark locations. C/2017 T2 could remain a telescopic comet though. One of the brightest comets anticipated in 2020 it makes its closest approach to the Sun in early May.","cluster, comet, starfield, full, moon, degree, heroic, northern, constellation, perseus, telescopic, exposure, made, night, january, hold, famous, pair, open, galactic, star, persei, panstarrs, c/2017, captured, swept, left, right, field, view, cataloged, light-year, contain, much, younger, hotter, separated, year, young, based, individual, evidence, likely, product, star-forming, region, discovered, orbit, saturn, visitor, inner, solar, system, light-minutes, planet, earth, rewarding, sight, binoculars, double, visible, unaided, dark, location, remain, brightest, anticipated, make, closest, approach, early"
Goldilocks Zones and Stars,"The Goldilocks zone is the habitable zone around a star where it's not too hot and not too cold for liquid water to exist on the surface of orbiting planets. This intriguing infographic includes relative sizes of those zones for yellow G stars like the Sun, along with orange K dwarf stars and red M dwarf stars, both cooler and fainter than the Sun. M stars (top) have small, close-in Goldilocks zones. They are also seen to live long (100 billion years or so) and are very abundant, making up about 73 percent of the stars in the Milky Way. Still, they have very active magnetic fields and may produce too much radiation harmful to life, with an estimated X-ray irradiance 400 times the quiet Sun. Sun-like G stars (bottom) have large Goldilocks zones and are relatively calm, with low amounts of harmful radiation. But they only account for 6 percent of Milky Way stars and are much shorter lived. In the search for habitable planets, K dwarf stars could be just right, though. Not too rare they have 40 billion year lifetimes, much longer than the Sun. With a relatively wide habitable zone they produce only modest amounts of harmful radiation. These Goldilocks stars account for about 13 percent of the stars of the Milky Way.","goldilocks, star, zone, habitable, cold, liquid, water, exist, surface, orbiting, planet, intriguing, infographic, includes, relative, size, yellow, orange, dwarf, cooler, fainter, small, close-in, seen, live, year, abundant, making, percent, milky, active, magnetic, field, produce, much, radiation, harmful, life, estimated, x-ray, irradiance, time, quiet, sun-like, bottom, large, calm, amount, account, shorter, lived, search, right, rare, wide, modest"
Apollo 14 Heads for Home,"When leaving lunar orbit in February 1971, the crew of Apollo 14 watched this Earthrise from their command module Kitty Hawk. With Earth's sunlit crescent just peeking over the lunar horizon, the cratered terrain in the foreground is along the lunar farside. Of course, while orbiting the Moon, the crew could watch Earth rise and set, but the Earth hung stationary in the sky over Fra Mauro Base, their landing site on the lunar surface.

Zeta Oph: Runaway Star,"Like a ship plowing through cosmic seas, runaway star Zeta Ophiuchi produces the arcing interstellar bow wave or bow shock seen in this stunning infrared portrait. In the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more massive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving toward the left at 24 kilometers per second. Its strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty interstellar material and shaping the curved shock front. What set this star in motion? Zeta Oph was likely once a member of a binary star system, its companion star was more massive and hence shorter lived. When the companion exploded as a supernova catastrophically losing mass, Zeta Oph was flung out of the system. About 460 light-years away, Zeta Oph is 65,000 times more luminous than the Sun and would be one of the brighter stars in the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring dust. The image spans about 1.5 degrees or 12 light-years at the estimated distance of Zeta Ophiuchi.

Solar Granules at Record High Resolution,"Why does the Sun's surface keep changing?  The help find out, the US National Science Foundation (NSF) has built the Daniel K. Inouye Solar Telescope in Hawaii, USA. The Inouye telescope has a larger mirror that enables the capturing of images of higher resolution, at a faster rate, and in more colors than ever before.  Featured are recently-released first-light images taken over 10 minutes and combined into a 5-second time-lapse video.  The video captures an area on the Sun roughly the size of our Earth, features granules roughly the size of a country, and resolves features as small as 30-kilometers across. Granule centers are bright due to the upwelling hot solar plasma, while granule edges are dim due to the cooled plasma falling back.  Some regions between granules edges are very bright as they are curious magnetic windows into a deep and hotter solar interior.  How the Sun's magnetic field keeps changing, channeling energy, and affecting the distant Earth, among many other topics, will be studied for years to come using data from the new Inouye telescope.

A Sunset Night Sky over the Grand Canyon,"Seeing mountain peaks glow red from inside the Grand Canyon was one of the most incredible sunset experiences of this amateur photographer's life. They appeared even more incredible later, when digitally combined with an exposure of the night sky -- taken by the same camera and from the same location -- an hour later.  The two images were taken last August from the 220 Mile Canyon campsite on the Colorado River, Arizona, USA. The peaks glow red because they were lit by an unusually red sunset.  Later, high above, the band of the Milky Way Galaxy angled dramatically down, filled with stars, nebula, and dark clouds of dust. To the Milky Way's left is the planet Saturn, while to the right is the brighter Jupiter.

Lunar Eclipse Perspectives,"Do we all see the same Moon?  Yes, but we all see it differently. One difference is the apparent location of the Moon against background stars -- an effect known as parallax. We humans use the parallax between our eyes to judge depth. To see lunar parallax, though, we need eyes placed at a much greater separations -- hundreds to thousands of kilometers apart.  Another difference is that observers around the Earth all see a slightly different face of our spherical Moon -- an effect known as libration. The featured image is a composite of many views across the Earth, as submitted to APOD, of the total lunar eclipse of 2019 January 21.  These images are projected against the same background stars to illustrate both effects.  The accurate superposition of these images was made possible by a serendipitous meteorite impact on the Moon during the lunar eclipse, labeled here L1-21J -- guaranteeing that these submitted images were all taken within a split second.  With the simultaneous observations made by independent amateur astronomers across the globe, a group of astronomers were able to use their citizen-science images to narrow down the location, orbit, and energy of this rare event.","lunar, eclipse, perspective, moon, difference, apparent, location, background, star, effect, known, parallax, human, judge, depth, need, placed, greater, separation, hundred, thousand, kilometer, earth, different, face, spherical, libration, featured, image, composite, many, view, submitted, apod, total, january, projected, illustrate, accurate, superposition, made, possible, serendipitous, meteorite, impact, labeled, guaranteeing, taken, split, second, simultaneous, observation, independent, amateur, astronomer, globe, group, able, citizen-science, narrow, orbit, energy, rare, event"

At the Moon's third quarter phase the lunar terminator, the sunset shadow line, is approaching from the left. The scene's foreshortened perspective heightens the impression of a dense field of craters and makes the craters themselves appear more oval shaped close to the lunar limb. Below and left of center is sharp-walled crater Tycho, 85 kilometers in diameter. Young Tycho's central peak is still in sunlight, but casts a long shadow across the crater floor. The large prominent crater to the south (above) Tycho is Clavius. Nearly 231 kilometers in diameter its walls and floor are pocked with smaller, more recent, overlaying impact craters.

NGC 7331 Close Up,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 7331 is often touted as an analog to our own Milky Way. About 50 million light-years distant in the northern constellation Pegasus, NGC 7331 was recognized early on as a spiral nebula and is actually one of the brighter galaxies not included in Charles Messier's famous 18th century catalog. Since the galaxy's disk is inclined to our line-of-sight, long telescopic exposures often result in an image that evokes a strong sense of depth. This Hubble Space Telescope close-up spans some 40,000 light-years. The galaxy's magnificent spiral arms feature dark obscuring dust lanes, bright bluish clusters of massive young stars, and the telltale reddish glow of active star forming regions.

It mixes reddish emission nebulae excited by energetic light from newborn stars with dark dust clouds. Where the otherwise obscuring dust clouds lie close to hot, young stars they also reflect starlight, forming blue reflection nebulae. A few light-years across, a simple sculpted shape known as the Cone Nebula is near center. Outlined by the red glow of hydrogen gas, the cone points toward the left and bright, blue-white S Monocerotis. Itself a multiple system of massive, hot stars S Mon is adjacent to bluish reflection nebulae and the convoluted Fox Fur nebula.

To Fly Free in Space,"What would it be like to fly free in space?  At about 100 meters from the cargo bay of the space shuttle Challenger, Bruce McCandless II was living the dream -- floating farther out than anyone had ever been before.  Guided by a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), astronaut McCandless, pictured, was floating free in space. McCandless and fellow NASA astronaut Robert Stewart were the first to experience such an ""untethered space walk"" during Space Shuttle mission 41-B in 1984.  The MMU worked by shooting jets of nitrogen and was used to help deploy and retrieve satellites.  With a mass over 140 kilograms, an MMU is heavy on Earth, but, like everything, is weightless when drifting in orbit. The MMU was later replaced with the SAFER backpack propulsion unit.","free, space, like, meter, cargo, shuttle, challenger, bruce, mccandless, living, dream, floating, anyone, guided, manned, maneuvering, unit, astronaut, pictured, fellow, robert, stewart, first, experience, untethered, walk, mission, 41-b, worked, shooting, nitrogen, used, help, deploy, retrieve, satellite, mass, kilogram, heavy, earth, everything, weightless, drifting, orbit, replaced, safer, backpack, propulsion"
Solar Eclipse over the UAE,"What's happening behind that camel? A partial eclipse of the Sun. About six and a half weeks ago, the Moon passed completely in front of the Sun as seen from a narrow band on the Earth. Despite (surely) many camels being located in this narrow band, only one found itself stationed between this camera, the distant Moon, and the even more distant Sun. To create this impressive superposition, though, took a well-planned trip to the United Arab Emirates, careful alignments, and accurate timings on the day of the eclipse.  Although the resulting featured image shows a partially eclipsed Sun rising, the Moon went on to appear completely engulfed by the Sun in an annular eclipse known as a ring of fire.

Pictured, a long duration exposure of the launch of the Solar Orbiter shows the graceful arc of the bright engines of United Launch Alliance's Atlas V rocket as they lifted the satellite off the Earth.  Over the next few years, the Solar Orbiter will use the gravity of Earth and Venus to veer out of the plane of the planets and closer to the Sun than Mercury.

Star Trails of the North and South,"What divides the north from the south? It all has to do with the spin of the Earth. On Earth's surface, the equator is the dividing line, but on Earth's sky, the dividing line is the Celestial Equator -- the equator's projection onto the sky.  You likely can't see the Earth's equator around you, but anyone with a clear night sky can find the Celestial Equator by watching stars move.  Just locate the dividing line between stars that arc north and stars that arc south.  Were you on Earth's equator, the Celestial Equator would go straight up and down.  In general, the angle between the Celestial Equator and the vertical is your latitude.  The featured image combines 325 photos taken every 30 seconds over 162 minutes.

Spitzer's Trifid,"The Trifid Nebula, also known as Messier 20, is easy to find with a small telescope. About 30 light-years across and 5,500 light-years distant it's a popular stop for cosmic tourists in the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. As its name suggests, visible light pictures show the nebula divided into three parts by dark, obscuring dust lanes. But this penetrating infrared image reveals the Trifid's filaments of glowing dust clouds and newborn stars. The spectacular false-color view is courtesy of the Spitzer Space Telescope. Astronomers have used the infrared image data to count newborn and embryonic stars which otherwise can lie hidden in the natal dust and gas clouds of this intriguing stellar nursery.

The Pale Blue Dot,"On Valentine's Day in 1990, cruising four billion miles from the Sun, the Voyager 1 spacecraft looked back one last time to make the first ever Solar System family portrait. The portrait consists of the Sun and six planets in a 60 frame mosaic made from a vantage point 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane. Planet Earth was captured within a single pixel in this single frame. It's the pale blue dot within the sunbeam just right of center in this reprocessed version of the now famous view from Voyager. Astronomer Carl Sagan originated the idea of using Voyager's camera to look back toward home from a distant perspective. Thirty years later, on this Valentine's day, look again at the pale blue dot.","pale, blue, valentine, cruising, mile, voyager, spacecraft, looked, last, time, make, first, solar, system, family, portrait, consists, planet, frame, mosaic, made, vantage, point, degree, ecliptic, plane, earth, captured, single, pixel, sunbeam, center, reprocessed, version, famous, view, astronomer, carl, sagan, originated, idea, using, camera, look, home, distant, perspective, thirty, year"
Carina Nebula Close Up,"A jewel of the southern sky, the Great Carina Nebula, also known as NGC 3372, spans over 300 light-years, one of our galaxy's largest star forming regions. Like the smaller, more northerly Great Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is easily visible to the unaided eye, though at a distance of 7,500 light-years it is some 5 times farther away. This gorgeous telescopic close-up reveals remarkable details of the region's central glowing filaments of interstellar gas and obscuring cosmic dust clouds in a field of view nearly 20 light-years across. The Carina Nebula is home to young, extremely massive stars, including the still enigmatic and violently variable Eta Carinae, a star system with well over 100 times the mass of the Sun. In the processed composite of space and ground-based image data a dusty, two-lobed Homunculus Nebula appears to surround Eta Carinae itself just below and left of center. While Eta Carinae is likely on the verge of a supernova explosion, X-ray images indicate that the Great Carina Nebula has been a veritable supernova factory.","carina, nebula, jewel, southern, great, known, span, light-year, galaxy, largest, star, forming, region, smaller, orion, visible, unaided, distance, time, farther, gorgeous, telescopic, close-up, reveals, remarkable, detail, central, glowing, filament, interstellar, obscuring, cosmic, dust, cloud, field, view, home, young, massive, including, enigmatic, variable, system, mass, processed, composite, space, ground-based, image, data, dusty, two-lobed, homunculus, appears, surround, left, center, likely, verge, supernova, explosion, x-ray, indicate, veritable, factory"
NGC 2392: Double-Shelled Planetary Nebula,"To some, this huge nebula resembles a person's head surrounded by a parka hood.  In 1787, astronomer William Herschel discovered this unusual planetary nebula:  NGC 2392.  More recently, the Hubble Space Telescope imaged the nebula in visible light,  The featured image  of the nebula shows gas clouds so complex they are not fully understood.  NGC 2392 is a double-shelled planetary nebula, with the more distant gas having composed the outer layers of a Sun-like star only 10,000 years ago.  The outer shell contains unusual light-year long orange filaments. The inner filaments visible are being ejected by strong wind of particles from the central star.  The NGC 2392 Nebula spans about 1/3 of a light year and lies in our Milky Way Galaxy, about 3,000 light years distant, toward the constellation of the Twins (Gemini).","double-shelled, planetary, nebula, huge, resembles, person, head, surrounded, parka, hood, astronomer, william, herschel, discovered, unusual, hubble, space, telescope, imaged, visible, light, featured, image, show, cloud, complex, understood, distant, composed, outer, layer, sun-like, star, year, shell, contains, light-year, long, orange, filament, inner, ejected, strong, wind, particle, central, span, milky, galaxy, constellation, twin, gemini"
The Changing Surface of Fading Betelgeuse,"Besides fading, is Betelgeuse changing its appearance? Yes. The famous red supergiant star in the familiar constellation of Orion is so large that telescopes on Earth can actually resolve its surface -- although just barely. The two featured images taken with the European Southern Observatory's Very Large Telescope show how the star's surface appeared during the beginning and end of last year.  The earlier image shows Betelgeuse having a much more uniform brightness than the later one, while the lower half of Betelgeuse became significantly dimmer than the top. Now during the first five months of 2019 amateur observations show Betelgeuse actually got slightly brighter, while in the last five months the star dimmed dramatically. Such variability is likely just normal behavior for this famously variable supergiant, but the recent dimming has rekindled discussion on how long it may be before Betelgeuse does go supernova. 	 Since Betelgeuse is about 700 light years away, its eventual supernova -- probably thousands of years in the future -- will likely be an amazing night-sky spectacle, but will not endanger life on Earth.","changing, surface, fading, betelgeuse, appearance, famous, supergiant, star, familiar, constellation, orion, large, telescope, earth, resolve, featured, image, taken, european, southern, observatory, show, appeared, beginning, last, year, much, uniform, brightness, lower, half, became, dimmer, month, amateur, observation, dimmed, variability, normal, variable, recent, dimming, rekindled, discussion, supernova, light, eventual, future, likely, amazing, night-sky, spectacle, endanger, life"
Orion over the Central Bohemian Highlands,"Do you recognize this constellation? Setting past the Central Bohemian Highlands in the Czech Republic is Orion, one of the most identifiable star groupings on the sky and an icon familiar to humanity for over 30,000 years. Orion has looked pretty much the same during this time and should continue to look the same for many thousands of years into the future.  Prominent Orion is high in the sky at sunset this time of year, a recurring sign of (modern) winter in Earth's northern hemisphere and summer in the south. The featured picture is a composite of over thirty images taken from the same location and during the same night last month.  Below and slightly to the left of Orion's three-star belt is the Orion Nebula, while four of the bright stars surrounding the belt are, clockwise, Sirius (far left, blue), Betelgeuse (top, orange, unusually faint), Aldebaran (far right), and Rigel (below).

UGC 12591: The Fastest Rotating Galaxy Known,"Why does this galaxy spin so fast?  To start, even identifying which type of galaxy UGC 12591 is difficult -- featured on the lower left, it has dark dust lanes like a spiral galaxy but a large diffuse bulge of stars like a lenticular. Surprisingly observations show that UGC 12591 spins at about 480 km/sec, almost twice as fast as our Milky Way, and the fastest rotation rate yet measured.  The mass needed to hold together a galaxy spinning this fast is several times the mass of our Milky Way Galaxy. Progenitor scenarios for UGC 12591 include slow growth by accreting ambient matter, or rapid growth through a recent galaxy collision or collisions -- future observations may tell.  The light we see today from UGC 12591 left about 400 million years ago, when trees were first developing on Earth.","fastest, rotating, galaxy, known, spin, fast, start, identifying, type, difficult, featured, lower, left, dark, dust, lane, spiral, large, diffuse, bulge, star, lenticular, observation, show, km/sec, milky, rotation, rate, measured, mass, needed, hold, spinning, several, time, progenitor, scenario, include, slow, growth, accreting, ambient, matter, rapid, recent, collision, future, tell, light, today, year, tree, first, developing, earth"
Trifecta at Twilight,"On February 18, as civil twilight began in northern New Mexico skies, the International Space Station, a waning crescent Moon, and planet Mars for a moment shared this well-planned single field of view. From the photographer's location the sky had just begun to grow light, but the space station orbiting 400 kilometers above the Earth was already bathed in the morning sunlight. At 6:25am local time it took about a second to cross in front of the lunar disk moving right to left in the composited successive frames. At the time, Mars itself had already emerged from behind the Moon following its much anticipated lunar occultation. The yellowish glow of the Red Planet is still in the frame at the upper right, beyond the Moon's dark edge.","trifecta, twilight, february, civil, began, northern, mexico, international, space, station, waning, crescent, moon, planet, moment, shared, well-planned, single, field, view, photographer, location, begun, grow, light, orbiting, kilometer, earth, bathed, morning, sunlight, local, time, took, second, cross, front, lunar, disk, moving, composited, successive, frame, emerged, following, much, anticipated, occultation, yellowish, glow, upper, right, dark, edge"
LDN 1622: Dark Nebula in Orion,"The silhouette of an intriguing dark nebula inhabits this cosmic scene. Lynds' Dark Nebula (LDN) 1622 appears against a faint background of glowing hydrogen gas only visible in long telescopic exposures of the region. In contrast, the brighter reflection nebula vdB 62 is more easily seen, just above and right of center. LDN 1622 lies near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, close on the sky to Barnard's Loop, a large cloud surrounding the rich complex of emission nebulae found in the Belt and Sword of Orion. With swept-back outlines, the obscuring dust of LDN 1622 is thought to lie at a similar distance, perhaps 1,500 light-years away. At that distance, this 1 degree wide field of view would span about 30 light-years. Young stars do lie hidden within the dark expanse and have been revealed in Spitzer Space telescope infrared images. Still, the foreboding visual appearance of LDN 1622 inspires its popular name, the Boogeyman Nebula.","dark, nebula, orion, silhouette, intriguing, inhabits, cosmic, scene, lynds, appears, faint, background, glowing, hydrogen, visible, long, telescopic, exposure, region, contrast, brighter, reflection, seen, right, center, plane, milky, galaxy, close, barnard, loop, large, cloud, surrounding, rich, complex, emission, found, sword, swept-back, outline, obscuring, dust, thought, similar, distance, light-year, degree, wide, field, view, span, young, star, hidden, expanse, revealed, spitzer, space, telescope, infrared, image, foreboding, visual, appearance, inspires, popular, name, boogeyman"
Central Centaurus A,"A mere 11 million light-years away, Centaurus A is the closest active galaxy to planet Earth. Also known as NGC 5128, the peculiar elliptical galaxy is over 60,000 light-years across. A region spanning about 8,500 light-years, including the galaxy's center (upper left), is framed in this sharp Hubble Space telescope close-up. Centaurus A is apparently the result of a collision of two otherwise normal galaxies resulting in a violent jumble of star forming regions, massive star clusters, and imposing dark dust lanes. Near the galaxy's center, left over cosmic debris is steadily being consumed by a central black hole with about 60 million times the mass of the Sun. As in other active galaxies, that process likely generates the radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray energy radiated by Centaurus A.","central, centaurus, light-year, closest, active, galaxy, planet, earth, known, peculiar, elliptical, region, spanning, including, center, upper, left, framed, sharp, hubble, space, telescope, close-up, result, collision, normal, resulting, violent, jumble, star, forming, massive, cluster, imposing, dark, dust, lane, cosmic, debris, consumed, black, hole, time, mass, process, likely, generates, radio, x-ray, gamma-ray, energy, radiated"
Illustris Simulation of the Universe,"How did we get here? Click play, sit back, and watch.  A computer simulation of the evolution of the universe provides insight into how galaxies formed and perspectives into humanity's place in the universe.  The Illustris project exhausted 20 million CPU hours in 2014 following 12 billion resolution elements spanning a cube 35 million light years on a side as it evolved over 13 billion years. The simulation tracks matter into the formation of a wide variety of galaxy types. As the virtual universe evolves, some of the matter expanding with the universe soon gravitationally condenses to form filaments, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. The featured video takes the perspective of a virtual camera circling part of this changing universe, first showing the evolution of dark matter, then hydrogen gas coded by temperature (0:45), then heavy elements such as helium and carbon (1:30), and then back to dark matter (2:07). On the lower left the time since the Big Bang is listed, while on the lower right the type of matter being shown is listed.  Explosions (0:50) depict galaxy-center supermassive black holes expelling bubbles of hot gas.

"Moon Corona, Halo, and Arcs over Manitoba","Yes, but could you get to work on time if the Moon looked like this? As the photographer was preparing to drive to work, refraction, reflection, and even diffraction of moonlight from millions of falling ice crystals turned the familiar icon of our Moon into a menagerie of other-worldly halos and arcs. The featured scene was captured with three combined exposures two weeks ago on a cold winter morning in Manitoba, Canada. The colorful rings are a corona caused by quantum diffraction by small drops of water or ice near the direction of the Moon. Outside of that, a 22-degree halo was created by moonlight refracting through six-sided cylindrical ice crystals. To the sides are moon dogs, caused by light refracting through thin, flat, six-sided ice platelets as they flittered toward the ground.  Visible at the top and bottom of the 22-degree halo are upper and lower tangent arcs, created by moonlight refracting through nearly horizontal hexagonal ice cylinders. A few minutes later, from a field just off the road to work, the halo and arcs had disappeared, the sky had returned to normal -- with the exception of a single faint moon dog.","moon, corona, halo, manitoba, work, time, looked, photographer, preparing, drive, refraction, reflection, diffraction, moonlight, falling, crystal, turned, familiar, icon, menagerie, featured, scene, captured, combined, exposure, week, cold, winter, morning, canada, colorful, ring, caused, quantum, small, drop, water, direction, 22-degree, created, refracting, six-sided, cylindrical, side, light, thin, flat, platelet, flittered, ground, visible, bottom, lower, tangent, horizontal, hexagonal, cylinder, minute, field, road, disappeared, returned, normal, exception, single, faint"
Jupiter's Magnetic Field from Juno,"How similar is Jupiter's magnetic field to Earth's? NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft has found that Jupiter's magnetic field is surprisingly complex, so that the Jovian world does not have single magnetic poles like our Earth.  A snapshot of Jupiter's magnetic field at one moment in time, as animated from Juno data, appears in the featured video. Red and blue colors depict cloud-top regions of strong positive (south) and negative (north) magnetic fields, respectively. Surrounding the planet are imagined magnetic field lines. The first sequence of the animated video starts off by showing what appears to be a relatively normal dipole field, but soon a magnetic region now known as the Great Blue Spot rotates into view, which is not directly aligned with Jupiter's rotation poles.  Further, in the second sequence, the illustrative animation takes us over one of Jupiter's spin poles where red magnetic hotspots are revealed to be extended and sometimes even annular.  A better understanding of Jupiter's magnetic field may give clues toward a better understanding of Earth's enigmatic planetary magnetism.","jupiter, magnetic, field, juno, similar, earth, nasa, robotic, spacecraft, found, complex, jovian, world, single, pole, snapshot, moment, time, animated, data, appears, featured, video, blue, color, depict, cloud-top, region, strong, positive, south, negative, north, surrounding, planet, imagined, line, sequence, start, showing, normal, dipole, known, great, spot, rotates, view, aligned, rotation, second, illustrative, animation, take, spin, hotspot, revealed, extended, annular, understanding, give, clue, better, enigmatic, planetary, magnetism"
NGTS-10b: Discovery of a Doomed Planet,"This hot jupiter is doomed.  Hot jupiters are giant planets like Jupiter that orbit much closer to their parent stars than Mercury does to our Sun.  But some hot jupiters are more extreme than others.  NGTS-10b, illustrated generically, is the closest and fastest-orbiting giant planet yet discovered, circling its home star in only 18 hours.  NGTS-10b is a little larger than Jupiter, but it orbits less than two times the diameter of its parent star away from the star’s surface.  When a planet orbits this close, it is expected to spiral inward, pulled down by tidal forces to be eventually ripped apart by the star’s gravity.  NGTS-10b, discovered by researchers at the University of Warwick, is named after the Next Generation Transit Survey, which detected the imperiled planet when it passed in front of its star, blocking some of the light.  Although the violent demise of NGTS-10b will happen eventually, we don't yet know when.","ngts-10b, discovery, doomed, planet, jupiter, giant, much, parent, star, mercury, extreme, others, illustrated, closest, fastest-orbiting, discovered, circling, home, hour, little, larger, orbit, less, time, diameter, surface, expected, spiral, inward, pulled, tidal, force, ripped, gravity, researcher, university, warwick, named, next, generation, transit, survey, detected, imperiled, passed, front, blocking, light, violent, demise, happen, know"
Two Hemisphere Night Sky,"The Sun is hidden by a horizon that runs across the middle in this two hemisphere view of Earth's night sky. The digitally stitched mosaics were recorded from corresponding latitudes, one 29 degrees north and one 29 degrees south of the planet's equator. On top is the northern view from the IAC observatory at La Palma taken in February 2020. Below is a well-matched southern scene from the ESO La Silla Observatory recorded in April 2016. In this projection, the Milky Way runs almost vertically above and below the horizon. Its dark clouds and and bright nebulae are prominent near the galactic center in the lower half of the frame. In the upper half, brilliant Venus is immersed in zodiacal light. Sunlight faintly scattered by interplanetary dust, the zodiacal light traces the Solar System's ecliptic plane in a complete circle through the starry sky.

South Celestial Rocket Launch,"At sunset on December 6 a Rocket Lab Electron rocket was launched from a rotating planet. With multiple small satellites on board it departed on a mission to low Earth orbit dubbed Running Out of Fingers from Mahia Peninsula on New Zealand's north island. The fiery trace of the Electron's graceful launch arc is toward the south in this southern sea and skyscape. Drifting vapor trails and rocket exhaust plumes catch the sunlight even as the sky grows dark though, the setting Sun still shinning at altitude along the rocket's trajectory. Fixed to a tripod, the camera's perspective nearly aligns the peak of the rocket arc with the South Celestial Pole, but no bright star marks that location in the southern hemisphere's evening sky. Still, it's easy to find at the center of the star trail arcs in the timelapse composite.","south, celestial, rocket, launch, sunset, december, electron, launched, rotating, planet, multiple, small, board, departed, mission, earth, orbit, dubbed, running, finger, mahia, peninsula, zealand, north, island, fiery, trace, graceful, southern, skyscape, drifting, vapor, trail, exhaust, plume, catch, sunlight, grows, dark, setting, shinning, altitude, trajectory, fixed, camera, perspective, aligns, peak, pole, bright, star, mark, location, evening, easy, find, center, timelapse, composite"
Julius Caesar and Leap Days,"In 46 BC Julius Caesar reformed the calendar system. Based on advice by astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria, the Julian calendar included one leap day every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long. In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days. So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for Julius Caesar himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter. By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the Julian calendar year would drift much less. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400. This Gregorian Calendar system is the one in wide use today. Of course, tidal friction in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 1.4 milliseconds per century. That means that leap days like today will not be necessary ... about 4 million years from now.","julius, caesar, leap, reformed, calendar, system, based, astronomer, sosigenes, alexandria, julian, included, year, account, fact, long, modern, term, time, take, planet, orbit, mean, solar, contained, drift, earth, named, occur, winter, adopting, extra, less, pope, gregory, xiii, provided, fine-tuning, ending, divisible, gregorian, wide, today, course, tidal, friction, earth-moon, slows, rotation, lengthens, millisecond, century, necessary"
A Hole in Mars,"What created this unusual hole in Mars? The hole was discovered by chance in 2011 on images of the dusty slopes of Mars' Pavonis Mons volcano taken by the HiRISE instrument aboard the robotic Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter currently circling Mars. The hole, shown in representative color, appears to be an opening to an underground cavern, partly illuminated on the image right.  Analysis of this and follow-up images revealed the opening to be about 35 meters across, while the interior shadow angle indicates that the underlying cavern is roughly 20 meters deep. Why there is a circular crater surrounding this hole remains a topic of speculation, as is the full extent of the underlying cavern. Holes such as this are of particular interest because their interior caves are relatively protected from the harsh surface of Mars, making them relatively good candidates to contain Martian life. These pits are therefore prime targets for possible future spacecraft, robots, and even human interplanetary explorers.","hole, created, unusual, discovered, chance, image, dusty, slope, pavonis, volcano, taken, hirise, instrument, robotic, reconnaissance, circling, shown, representative, color, appears, opening, underground, cavern, illuminated, right, analysis, follow-up, revealed, meter, interior, shadow, angle, indicates, underlying, deep, circular, crater, surrounding, remains, topic, speculation, full, extent, particular, interest, cave, protected, harsh, surface, making, good, candidate, contain, martian, life, prime, target, possible, future, spacecraft, robot, human, interplanetary, explorer"
Sharpless-308: The Dolphin Nebula,"Blown by fast winds from a hot, massive star, this cosmic bubble is much larger than the dolphin it appears to be. Cataloged as Sharpless 2-308 it lies some 5,200 light-years away toward the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major) and covers slightly more of the sky than a Full Moon. That corresponds to a diameter of 60 light-years at its estimated distance. The massive star that created the bubble, a Wolf-Rayet star, is the bright one near the center of the nebula. Wolf-Rayet stars have over 20 times the mass of the Sun and are thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova phase of massive star evolution. Fast winds from this Wolf-Rayet star create the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution. The windblown nebula has an age of about 70,000 years. Relatively faint emission captured in the featured expansive image is dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atoms mapped to a blue hue.","sharpless-308, dolphin, nebula, blown, massive, star, cosmic, bubble, larger, appears, cataloged, sharpless, 2-308, light-year, constellation, canis, major, cover, full, moon, corresponds, diameter, estimated, distance, created, wolf-rayet, bright, center, time, mass, thought, brief, pre-supernova, phase, evolution, create, bubble-shaped, sweep, slower, moving, material, year, faint, emission, captured, featured, expansive, image, dominated, glow, ionized, oxygen, atom, mapped, blue"
Apollo 13 Views of the Moon,"What if the only way to get back to Earth was to go around the far side of the Moon? Such was the dilemma of the Apollo 13 Crew in 1970 as they tried to return home in their unexpectedly damaged spacecraft. With the Moon in the middle, their perilous journey substituted spectacular views of the lunar farside for radio contact with NASA's Mission Control. These views have now been digitally recreated from detailed images of the Moon taken by the robotic Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter. The featured video starts by showing Earth disappear behind a dark lunar limb, while eight minutes later the Sun rises around the opposite side of the Moon and begins to illuminate the Moon's unusual and spectacularly cratered surface.  Radio contact was only re-established several minutes after that, as a crescent Earth rose into view.  With the gravity of the Moon and the advice of many industrious NASA engineers and scientists, a few days later Apollo 13 opened its parachutes over the Pacific Ocean and landed safely back on Earth.","view, moon, earth, side, dilemma, apollo, crew, tried, return, home, damaged, spacecraft, middle, perilous, journey, substituted, spectacular, lunar, farside, radio, contact, nasa, mission, control, recreated, detailed, image, taken, robotic, reconnaissance, orbiter, featured, video, start, showing, disappear, dark, limb, minute, rise, opposite, begin, illuminate, unusual, cratered, surface, re-established, several, crescent, rose, gravity, advice, many, industrious, engineer, scientist, opened, parachute, pacific, ocean, landed"
The Slow Dance of Galaxies NGC 5394 and 5395,"If you like slow dances, then this may be one for you.  A single turn in this dance takes several hundred million years.  Two galaxies, NGC 5394 and NGC 5395, slowly whirl about each other in a gravitational interaction that sets off a flourish of sparks in the form of new stars.  The featured image, taken with the Gemini North 8-meter telescope on Maunakea, Hawaii, USA, combines four different colors.  Emission from hydrogen gas, colored red, marks stellar nurseries where new stars drive the evolution of the galaxies.  Also visible are dark dust lanes that mark gas that will eventually become stellar nurseries.

Mars Panorama from Curiosity,"The Mars Rover named Curiosity recorded high-resolution, 360 degree views of its location on Mars late last year. The panoramic scene was stitched from over 1,000 images from Curiosity's Mast camera or Mastcam. In this version, captured with Mastcam's medium angle lens, the rover's deck and robotic arm are in the foreground, stretched and distorted by the extreme wide perspective. Just beyond the rover are regions of clay rich rock, evidence for an ancient watery environment, with a clear view toward more distant martian ridges and buttes. Gale crater wall runs across the center (toward the north) in the background over 30 kilometers in the distance. The upper reaches of Mt. Sharp are at the far right. Images to construct the panorama were recorded over 4 consecutive sols between local noon and 2pm to provide consistent lighting.

Pic du Midi Panorama,"A surreal night skyscape, this panorama stitched from 12 photos looks to the west at an evening winter sky over Pic du Midi Observatory, Pyrenees Mountains, Planet Earth. Telescope domes and a tall communications tower inhabit the rugged foreground. On the right, lights from Tarbes, France about 35 kilometers away impinge on the designated dark sky site though, but more distant terrestrial lights seen toward the left are from cities in Spain. Stars and nebulae of the northern winter's Milky Way arc through the sky above. Known to the planet's night skygazers, the Pleiades and Hyades star clusters still hang over the western horizon near center.

Wolf-Rayet Star 124: Stellar Wind Machine,"Some stars explode in slow motion.  Rare, massive Wolf-Rayet stars are so tumultuous and hot that they are slowly disintegrating right before our telescopes.  Glowing gas globs each typically over 30 times more massive than the Earth are being expelled by violent stellar winds.  Wolf-Rayet star WR 124, visible near the featured image center spanning six light years across, is thus creating the surrounding nebula known as M1-67.  Details of why this star has been slowly blowing itself apart over the past 20,000 years remains a topic of research.  WR 124 lies 15,000 light-years away towards the constellation of the Arrow (Sagitta).  The fate of any given Wolf-Rayet star likely depends on how massive it is, but many are thought to end their lives with spectacular explosions such as supernovas or gamma-ray bursts.","wolf-rayet, star, stellar, wind, machine, explode, slow, motion, rare, massive, tumultuous, disintegrating, right, telescope, glowing, glob, time, earth, expelled, violent, visible, featured, image, center, spanning, light, year, creating, surrounding, nebula, known, m1-67, detail, blowing, remains, topic, research, light-year, constellation, arrow, sagitta, fate, given, likely, depends, many, thought, life, spectacular, explosion, supernova, gamma-ray, burst"
Milky Way and Zodiacal Light over Chile,"What is the band of light connecting the ground to the Milky Way?  Zodiacal light -- a stream of dust that orbits the Sun in the inner Solar System. It is most easily seen just before sunrise, where it has been called a false dawn, or just after sunset. The origin of zodiacal dust remains a topic of research, but is hypothesized to result from asteroid collisions and comet tails.  The featured wide-angle image shows the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy arching across the top, while the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), a satellite galaxy to our Milky Way, is visible on the far left. The image is a combination of over 30 exposures taken last July near La Serena among the mountains of Chile.  During the next two months, zodiacal light can appear quite prominent in northern skies just after sunset.

"Wide Field: Fox Fur, Unicorn, and Christmas Tree","What do the following things have in common: a cone, the fur of a fox, and a Christmas tree?  Answer: they all occur in the constellation of the unicorn (Monoceros).  Pictured as a star forming region and cataloged as NGC 2264, the complex jumble of cosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light-years distant and mixes reddish emission nebulae excited by energetic light from newborn stars with dark interstellar dust clouds. Where the otherwise obscuring dust clouds lie close to the hot, young stars they also reflect starlight, forming blue reflection nebulae. The featured wide-field image spans over three times the diameter of a full moon, covering over 100 light-years at the distance of NGC 2264. Its cast of cosmic characters includes the Fox Fur Nebula, whose convoluted pelt lies just to the lower right of the image center, bright variable star S Mon visible just above the Fox Fur, and the Cone Nebula just to the left.  Given their distribution, the stars of NGC 2264 are also known as the Christmas Tree star cluster.","wide, field, unicorn, christmas, tree, following, thing, common, cone, answer, occur, constellation, monoceros, pictured, star, forming, region, cataloged, complex, jumble, cosmic, dust, light-year, distant, reddish, emission, excited, energetic, light, newborn, dark, interstellar, cloud, obscuring, close, young, reflect, starlight, blue, reflection, nebula, featured, wide-field, image, span, time, full, moon, covering, distance, cast, character, includes, convoluted, pelt, lower, right, center, bright, variable, visible, left, given, distribution, known, cluster"
An Extreme Black Hole Outburst,"Astronomers believe they have now found the most powerful example of a black hole outburst yet seen in our Universe.  The composite, false-color featured image is of a cluster of galaxies in the constellation of Ophiuchus, the serpent-bearer.  The composite includes X-ray images (from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and XMM-Newton) in purple, and a radio image (from India's Giant Metrewave Radio Telescope) in blue (along with an infrared image of the galaxies and stars in the field in white for good measure).  The dashed line marks the border of a cavity blown out by the supermassive black hole which lurks at the center of the galaxy marked by the cross.  Radio emission fills this cavity.  This big blowout is believed to be due to the black hole eating too much and experiencing a transient bout of ""black hole nausea"", which resulted in the ejection of a powerful radio jet blasting into intergalactic space.  The amount of energy needed to blow this cavity is equivalent to about 10 billion supernova explosions.","extreme, black, hole, outburst, astronomer, believe, found, powerful, example, seen, universe, composite, false-color, featured, image, cluster, galaxy, constellation, serpent-bearer, includes, x-ray, chandra, observatory, xmm-newton, purple, radio, india, giant, metrewave, telescope, blue, infrared, star, field, white, good, measure, dashed, line, mark, border, cavity, blown, supermassive, lurks, center, marked, cross, emission, fill, blowout, believed, eating, much, experiencing, transient, nausea, resulted, ejection, blasting, intergalactic, space, amount, energy, needed, blow, equivalent, supernova, explosion"
Falcon 9 Boostback,"Short star trails appear in this single 84 second long exposure, taken on March 6 from a rotating planet. The remarkable scene also captures the flight of a Falcon 9 rocket and Dragon cargo spacecraft over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station shortly after launch, on a resupply mission bound for the International Space Station. Beginning its return to a landing zone about 9 kilometers from the launch site, the Falcon 9 first stage boostback burn arcs toward the top of the frame. The second stage continues toward low Earth orbit though, its own fiery arc traced below the first stage boostback burn from the camera's perspective, along with expanding exhaust plumes from the two stages. This Dragon spacecraft was a veteran of two previous resupply missions. Successfully returning to the landing zone, this Falcon 9 first stage had flown before too. Its second landing marked the 50th landing of a SpaceX orbital class rocket booster.","falcon, boostback, short, star, trail, appear, single, second, long, exposure, taken, rotating, planet, remarkable, scene, capture, flight, rocket, dragon, cargo, spacecraft, cape, canaveral, force, station, launch, resupply, mission, international, space, beginning, return, landing, kilometer, site, first, stage, burn, frame, continues, earth, orbit, fiery, traced, camera, perspective, expanding, exhaust, plume, veteran, previous, returning, zone, flown, marked, spacex, orbital, class, booster"
Starry Night by Jean-Francois Millet,"A dramatic nocturnal landscape from around 1850, this oil painting is the work of French artist Jean-Francois Millet. In the dark and atmospheric night sky are shooting stars, known too as meteors, above a landscape showing a path through the faintly lit countryside that leads toward trees and a cart in silhouette on the horizon. Millet was raised in a farming family in Normandy and is known for his paintings of rural scenes and peasant life. This Starry Night was painted after the artist moved to Barbizon, about 30 kilometers southeast of any 19th century light pollution from Paris. Millet wrote to his brother at this time, ""If only you knew how beautiful the night is ... the calm and grandeur of it are so awesome that I find that I actually feel overwhelmed."" Dutch artist Vincent van Gogh was an admirer of Millet's work, and later also painted two dramatic starry nights.","starry, night, jean-francois, millet, dramatic, nocturnal, landscape, painting, work, french, artist, dark, atmospheric, shooting, star, known, meteor, showing, path, countryside, lead, tree, cart, silhouette, horizon, raised, farming, family, rural, scene, peasant, life, painted, moved, kilometer, southeast, 19th, century, light, pollution, paris, wrote, brother, time, knew, beautiful, calm, grandeur, awesome, find, feel, overwhelmed, dutch, vincent, gogh, admirer"
Moonrise and Mountain Shadow,"What phase of the Moon is 3.14 radians from the Sun? The Full Moon, of course. Even though the Moon might look full for several days, the Moon is truly at its full phase when it is 3.14 radians (aka 180 degrees) from the Sun in ecliptic longitude. That's opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky. Rising as the Sun set on March 9, only an hour or so after the moment of its full phase, this orange tinted and slightly flattened Moon still looked full. It was photographed opposite the setting Sun from Teide National Park on the Canary Island of Tenerife. Also opposite the setting Sun, seen from near the Teide volcano peak about 3,500 meters above sea level, is the mountain's rising triangular shadow extending into Earth's dense atmosphere.

The Snows of Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"You couldn't really be caught in this blizzard while standing by a cliff on Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Orbiting the comet -- frequently abbreviated as 67P or CG -- in June of 2016, the Rosetta spacecraft's narrow angle camera did record streaks of dust and ice particles -- similar to snow -- as they drifted across the field of view near the camera and above the comet's surface. Some of the bright specks in the scene, however, are likely due to a rain of energetic charged particles or cosmic rays hitting the camera, and the dense background of stars in the direction of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). In the featured video, these background stars are easy to spot trailing from top to bottom. The stunning movie was constructed from 33 consecutive images taken over 25 minutes while Rosetta cruised some 13 kilometers from the comet's nucleus.","snow, churyumov-gerasimenko, caught, blizzard, standing, cliff, orbiting, comet, abbreviated, june, rosetta, spacecraft, narrow, angle, camera, record, streak, dust, particle, similar, drifted, field, view, surface, bright, speck, scene, likely, rain, energetic, charged, cosmic, hitting, dense, background, star, direction, constellation, canis, major, featured, video, easy, spot, trailing, bottom, stunning, movie, constructed, consecutive, image, taken, minute, cruised, kilometer, nucleus"
A Moon Dressed Like Saturn,"Why does Saturn appear so big? It doesn't -- what is pictured are foreground clouds on Earth crossing in front of the Moon. The Moon shows a slight crescent phase with most of its surface visible by reflected Earthlight known as ashen glow. The Sun directly illuminates the brightly lit lunar crescent from the bottom, which means that the Sun must be below the horizon and so the image was taken before sunrise.  This double take-inducing picture was captured on 2019 December 24, two days before the Moon slid in front of the Sun to create a solar eclipse. In the foreground, lights from small Guatemalan towns are visible behind the huge volcano Pacaya.

M77: Spiral Galaxy with an Active Center,"What's happening in the center of nearby spiral galaxy M77? The face-on galaxy lies a mere 47 million light-years away toward the constellation of the Sea Monster (Cetus).  At that estimated distance, this gorgeous island universe is about 100 thousand light-years across.  Also known as NGC 1068, its compact and very bright core is well studied by astronomers exploring the mysteries of supermassive black holes in active Seyfert galaxies.  M77 and its active core glows bright at x-ray, ultraviolet, visible, infrared, and radio wavelengths.  The featured sharp image of M77 was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and is dominated by the (visible) red light emitted by hydrogen.  The image shows details of the spiral's winding spiral arms as traced by obscuring dust clouds, and red-tinted star forming regions close in to the galaxy's luminous core.

Anticrepuscular Rays over Florida,"What's happening behind those clouds?  Although the scene may appear somehow supernatural, nothing more unusual is occurring than a Sun setting on the other side of the sky.  Pictured here are anticrepuscular rays.  To understand them, start by picturing common crepuscular rays that are seen any time that sunlight pours though scattered clouds. Now although sunlight indeed travels along straight lines, the projections of these lines onto the spherical sky are great circles.  Therefore, the crepuscular rays from a setting (or rising) sun will appear to re-converge on the other side of the sky.  At the anti-solar point 180 degrees around from the Sun, they are referred to as anticrepuscular rays.  Featured here is a particularly striking display of anticrepuscular rays photographed in 2016 over Dry Tortugas National Park in Florida, USA.","anticrepuscular, florida, happening, cloud, scene, appear, supernatural, nothing, unusual, occurring, setting, side, pictured, understand, start, picturing, common, crepuscular, seen, time, sunlight, pours, scattered, travel, straight, line, projection, spherical, great, circle, rising, re-converge, anti-solar, point, degree, referred, featured, striking, display, photographed, tortugas, national, park"
M13: The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules,"In 1716, English astronomer Edmond Halley noted, ""This is but a little Patch, but it shews itself to the naked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent."" Of course, M13 is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, one of the brightest globular star clusters in the northern sky. Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core and reveals three subtle dark lanes forming the apparent shape of a propeller just below and slightly left of center. Distant background galaxies in the medium-wide field of view include NGC 6207 at the upper left.","great, globular, cluster, hercules, english, astronomer, edmond, halley, noted, little, patch, shews, naked, serene, moon, absent, course, recognized, brightest, star, northern, sharp, telescopic, view, reveal, spectacular, hundred, distance, light-year, crowd, region, diameter, approaching, core, upwards, contained, cube, side, comparison, closest, remarkable, range, brightness, recorded, image, follows, dense, reveals, subtle, dark, lane, forming, apparent, shape, propeller, left, center, distant, background, galaxy, medium-wide, field, include, upper"
"Morning, Planets, Moon and Montreal","Dawn's early light came to Montreal, northern planet Earth, on March 18, the day before the vernal equinox. At the end of that nearly equal night the Moon stands above a dense constellation of urban lights in this serene city and skyscape. Of course the Moon's waning crescent faces toward the rising Sun. Skygazers could easily spot bright Jupiter just above the Moon, close on the sky to a fainter Mars. Saturn, a telescopic favorite, is just a pinprick of light below and farther left of the closer conjunction of Moon, Jupiter and Mars. Near the ecliptic, even Mercury is rising along a line extended to the horizon from Jupiter and Saturn. The elusive inner planet is very close to the horizon though, and not quite visible in this morning's sky.","morning, planet, moon, montreal, dawn, early, light, came, northern, earth, march, vernal, equinox, equal, night, stand, dense, constellation, urban, serene, city, skyscape, course, waning, crescent, face, rising, skygazers, spot, bright, jupiter, fainter, saturn, telescopic, favorite, pinprick, left, closer, conjunction, ecliptic, mercury, line, extended, horizon, elusive, inner, close, visible"
Comet ATLAS and the Mighty Galaxies,"Comet ATLAS C/2019 Y4 was discovered by the NASA funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System, the last comet discovery reported in 2019. Now growing brighter in northern night skies, the comet's pretty greenish coma is at the upper left of this telescopic skyview captured from a remotely operated observatory in New Mexico on March 18. At lower right are M81 and M82, well-known as large, gravitationally interacting galaxies. Seen through faint dust clouds above the Milky Way, the galaxy pair lies about 12 million light-years distant, toward the constellation Ursa Major. In bound Comet ATLAS is about 9 light-minutes from Earth, still beyond the orbit of Mars. The comet's elongated orbit is similar to orbit of the Great Comet of 1844 though, a trajectory that will return this comet to the inner Solar System in about 6,000 years.  Comet ATLAS will reach a perihelion or closest approach to the Sun on May 31 inside the orbit of Mercury and may become a naked-eye comet in the coming days.","comet, atlas, mighty, galaxy, c/2019, discovered, funded, asteroid, terrestrial-impact, last, alert, system, discovery, reported, growing, brighter, northern, night, pretty, greenish, coma, upper, left, telescopic, skyview, captured, operated, observatory, mexico, march, lower, right, well-known, large, interacting, seen, faint, dust, cloud, milky, pair, light-year, distant, constellation, major, bound, light-minutes, earth, orbit, elongated, similar, great, trajectory, return, inner, solar, year, reach, perihelion, closest, approach, inside, mercury, become, naked-eye, coming"
Moon Setting Behind Teide Volcano,"These people are not in danger. What is coming down from the left is just the Moon, far in the distance. Luna appears so large here because she is being photographed through a telescopic lens.  What is moving is mostly the Earth, whose spin causes the Moon to slowly disappear behind Mount Teide, a volcano in the Canary Islands off the northwest coast of Africa. The people pictured are 16 kilometers away and  many are facing the camera because they are watching the Sun rise behind the photographer. It is not a coincidence that a full moon rises just when the Sun sets because the Sun is always on the opposite side of the sky from a full moon.

From the Pleiades to the Eridanus Loop,"If you stare at an interesting patch of sky long enough, will it look different? In the case of Pleiades and Hyades star clusters -- and surrounding regions -- the answer is: yes, pretty different. Long duration camera exposures reveal an intricate network of interwoven interstellar dust and gas that was previously invisible not only to the eye but to lower exposure images. In the featured wide and deep mosaic, the dust stands out spectacularly, with the familiar Pleaides star cluster visible as the blue patch near the top of the image.  Blue is the color of the Pleiades' most massive stars, whose distinctive light reflects from nearby fine dust. On the upper left is the Hyades star cluster surrounding the bright, orange, foreground-star Aldebaran.  Red glowing emission nebula highlight the bottom of the image, including the curving vertical red ribbon known as the Eridanus Loop.

A Black Hole Disrupts a Passing Star,"What happens to a star that goes near a black hole? If the star directly impacts a massive black hole, then the star falls in completely -- and everything vanishes. More likely, though, the star goes close enough to have the black hole's gravity pull away the outer layers of the star, or disrupt the star. Then most of the star's gas does not fall into the black hole.  These stellar tidal disruption events can be as bright as a supernova, and an increasing amount of them are being discovered by automated sky surveys. In the featured artist's illustration, a star has just passed a massive black hole and sheds gas that continues to orbit.  The inner edge of a disk of gas and dust surrounding the black hole is heated by the disruption event and may glow long after the star  is gone.","black, hole, disrupts, passing, star, happens, impact, massive, fall, everything, vanishes, likely, enough, gravity, pull, outer, layer, disrupt, stellar, tidal, disruption, event, bright, increasing, amount, discovered, automated, survey, featured, artist, illustration, passed, shed, continues, orbit, inner, edge, disk, dust, surrounding, heated, glow, long, gone"
Star Forming Region S106,"Massive star IRS 4 is beginning to spread its wings.  Born only about 100,000 years ago, material streaming out from this newborn star has formed the nebula dubbed Sharpless 2-106 Nebula (S106), featured here.  A large disk of dust and gas orbiting Infrared Source 4 (IRS 4), visible in brown near the image center, gives the nebula an hourglass or butterfly shape.  S106 gas near IRS 4 acts as an emission nebula as it emits light after being ionized, while dust far from IRS 4 reflects light from the central star and so acts as a reflection nebula.  Detailed inspection of a relevant  infrared image of S106  reveal hundreds of low-mass brown dwarf stars lurking in the nebula's gas.  S106 spans about 2 light-years and lies about 2000 light-years away toward the  constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).","star, forming, region, massive, beginning, spread, wing, born, year, material, streaming, newborn, formed, nebula, dubbed, sharpless, 2-106, s106, featured, large, disk, dust, orbiting, infrared, source, visible, brown, image, center, give, hourglass, butterfly, shape, emission, emits, light, ionized, reflects, central, reflection, detailed, inspection, relevant, reveal, hundred, low-mass, dwarf, lurking, span, light-year, constellation, swan, cygnus"
Andromeda Station,"This surreal picture isn't from a special effects sci-fi movie. It is a digital composite of frames of the real Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, rising over a real mountain. Exposures tracking the galaxy and background stars have been digitally combined with separate exposures of the foreground terrain. All background and foreground exposures were made back to back with the same camera and telephoto lens on the same night from the same location. In the ""Deepscape"" combination they produce a stunning image that reveals a range of brightness and color that your eye can't quite see on its own. Still, it does look like you could ride a cable car up this mountain and get off at the station right next to Andromeda. But at 2.5 million light-years from Earth the big beautiful spiral galaxy really is a little out of reach as a destination. Don't worry, though. Just wait 5 billion years and the Andromeda Galaxy will come to you.

A Little Drop of Galaxy,"A drop of water seems to hold an entire galaxy in this creative macro-astrophotograph. In the imaginative work of cosmic nature photography a close-up lens was used to image a previously made picture of a galaxy, viewed through a water drop suspended from a stem. A favorite of many telescope-wielding astroimagers, the galaxy is the Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31. About 100,000 light-years across that majestic galaxy's spiral arms and dust lanes are curved and distorted in the image contained in the centimeter-sized droplet. Andromeda is some 2.5 million light-years distant, but this project was still carried out while spending time indoors.","little, drop, galaxy, water, seems, hold, entire, creative, macro-astrophotograph, imaginative, work, cosmic, nature, photography, close-up, lens, used, image, made, picture, viewed, suspended, stem, favorite, many, telescope-wielding, astroimagers, andromeda, known, light-year, majestic, spiral, dust, lane, curved, distorted, contained, centimeter-sized, droplet, distant, project, carried, spending, time, indoors"
Stars Trail over Ragusa,"In trying times, stars still trail in the night. Taken on March 14, this night skyscape was made by combining 230 exposures each 15 seconds long to follow the stars' circular paths. The camera was fixed to a tripod on an isolated terrace near the center of Ragusa, Italy, on the island of Sicily. But the night sky was shared around the rotating planet. A friend to celestial navigators and astrophotographers alike Polaris, the north star, makes the short bright trail near the center of the concentric celestial arcs.","star, trail, ragusa, trying, time, night, taken, skyscape, made, combining, exposure, second, follow, circular, path, camera, fixed, isolated, terrace, center, italy, island, shared, rotating, planet, friend, celestial, navigator, astrophotographers, polaris, north, make, short, bright, concentric"
A 212-Hour Exposure of Orion,"The constellation of Orion is much more than three stars in a row. It is a direction in space that is rich with impressive nebulas. To better appreciate this well-known swath of sky, an extremely long exposure was taken over many clear nights in 2013 and 2014. After 212 hours of camera time and an additional year of processing, the featured 1400-exposure collage spanning over 40 times the angular diameter of the Moon emerged.  Of the many interesting details that have become visible, one that particularly draws the eye is Barnard's Loop, the bright red circular filament arcing down from the middle. The Rosette Nebula is not the giant red nebula near the top of the image -- that is a larger but lesser known nebula known as Lambda Orionis.  The Rosette Nebula is visible, though: it is the red and white nebula on the upper left.  The bright orange star just above the frame center is Betelgeuse, while the bright blue star on the lower right is Rigel. Other famous nebulas visible include the Witch Head Nebula, the Flame Nebula, the Fox Fur Nebula, and, if you know just where to look, the comparatively small Horsehead Nebula. About those famous three stars that cross the belt of Orion the Hunter -- in this busy frame they can be hard to locate, but a discerning eye will find them just below and to the right of the image center.","212-hour, exposure, orion, constellation, star, direction, space, rich, impressive, nebula, appreciate, well-known, swath, long, taken, many, clear, night, hour, camera, time, additional, year, processing, featured, 1400-exposure, collage, spanning, angular, diameter, moon, emerged, interesting, detail, become, visible, draw, barnard, loop, bright, circular, filament, arcing, middle, rosette, giant, image, larger, lesser, known, lambda, orionis, white, upper, left, orange, frame, center, betelgeuse, blue, lower, right, rigel, famous, include, witch, head, flame, know, look, small, horsehead, cross, belt, hunter, busy, hard, locate, discerning, find"
The Colors of Saturn from Cassini,"What creates Saturn's colors?  The featured picture of Saturn only slightly exaggerates what a human would see if hovering close to the giant ringed world.   The image was taken in 2005 by the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Here Saturn's majestic rings appear directly only as a curved line, appearing brown, in part, from its infrared glow.  The rings best show their complex structure in the dark shadows they create across the upper part of the planet.   The northern hemisphere of Saturn can appear partly blue for the same reason that Earth's skies can appear blue -- molecules in the cloudless portions of both planet's atmospheres are better at scattering blue light than red.  When looking deep into Saturn's clouds, however, the natural gold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant.   It is not known why southern Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- one hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there.   It is also not known why some of Saturn's clouds are colored gold.

The Galactic Center from Radio to X-ray,"In how many ways does the center of our Galaxy glow?  This enigmatic region, about 26,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius), glows in every type of light that we can see.  In the featured image, high-energy X-ray emission captured by NASA's orbiting Chandra X-Ray Observatory appears in green and blue, while low-energy radio emission captured by SARAO's ground-based MeerKAT telescope array is colored red. Just on the right of the colorful central region lies Sagittarius A (Sag A), a strong radio source that coincides with Sag A*, our Galaxy's central supermassive black hole. Hot gas surrounds Sag A, as well as a series of parallel radio filaments known as the Arc, seen just left of the image center.  Numerous unusual single radio filaments are visible around the image. Many stars orbit in and around Sag A, as well as numerous small black holes and dense stellar cores known as neutron stars and white dwarfs.  The Milky Way's central supermassive black hole is currently being imaged by the Event Horizon Telescope.

Asteroid or Potato?,"Is this asteroid Arrokoth or a potato? Perhaps, after all the data was beamed back to Earth from NASA's  robotic New Horizons spacecraft, the featured high resolution image of asteroid Arrokoth was constructed.  Perhaps, alternatively, the featured image is of a potato. Let's consider some facts.  Arrokoth is the most distant asteroid ever visited and a surviving remnant of the early years of our Solar System. A potato is a root vegetable that you can eat.  Happy April Fool's Day from the folks at APOD!  Although asteroid Arrokoth may look like a potato, in fact very much like the featured potato, Arrokoth (formerly known as Ultima Thule) is about 200,000 times wider and much harder to eat.

Venus and the Pleiades in April,"Venus is currently the brilliant evening star. Shared around world, in tonight's sky Venus will begin to wander across the face of the lovely Pleiades star cluster. This digital sky map illustrates the path of the inner planet as the beautiful conjunction evolves, showing its position on the sky over the next few days. The field of view shown is appropriate for binocular equipped skygazers but the star cluster and planet are easily seen with the naked-eye. As viewed from our fair planet, Venus passed in front of the stars of the Seven Sisters 8 years ago, and will again 8 years hence. In fact, orbiting the Sun 13 Venus years are almost equal to 8 years on planet Earth. So we can expect our sister planet to visit nearly the same place in our sky every 8 years.","venus, pleiades, april, brilliant, evening, star, shared, world, tonight, begin, wander, face, cluster, digital, illustrates, path, inner, planet, beautiful, conjunction, evolves, showing, position, next, field, view, shown, appropriate, binocular, equipped, skygazers, seen, naked-eye, viewed, fair, passed, front, sister, year, hence, fact, orbiting, equal, earth, expect, visit, place"
The Traffic in Taurus,"There's a traffic jam in Taurus lately. On April 1, this celestial frame from slightly hazy skies over Tapiobicske, Hungary recorded an impressive pile up toward the zodiacal constellation of the Bull and the Solar System's ecliptic plane. Streaking right to left the International Space Station speeds across the bottom of the telescopic field of view. Wandering about as far from the Sun in planet Earth's skies as it can get, inner planet Venus is bright and approaching much slower, overexposed at the right. Bystanding at the upper left are the sister stars of the Pleiades. No one has been injured in the close encounter though, because it really isn't very close. Continuously occupied since November 2000, the space station orbits some 400 kilometers above the planet's surface. Venus, currently the brilliant evening star, is almost 2/3 of an astronomical unit away. A more permanent resident of Taurus, the Pleiades star cluster is 400 light-years distant.","traffic, taurus, april, celestial, frame, hazy, tapiobicske, hungary, recorded, impressive, pile, zodiacal, constellation, bull, solar, system, ecliptic, plane, streaking, right, left, international, space, station, speed, bottom, telescopic, field, view, wandering, planet, earth, inner, venus, bright, approaching, slower, overexposed, bystanding, upper, sister, star, pleiades, injured, encounter, close, occupied, november, orbit, kilometer, surface, brilliant, evening, astronomical, unit, permanent, resident, cluster, light-year, distant"
Venus and the Sisters,"After wandering about as far from the Sun on the sky as Venus can get, the brilliant evening star is crossing paths with the sister stars of the Pleiades cluster. Look west after sunset and you can share the ongoing conjunction with skygazers around the world. Taken on April 2, this celestial group photo captures the view from Portal, Arizona, USA. Even bright naked-eye Pleiades stars prove to be much fainter than Venus though. Apparent in deeper telescopic images, the cluster's dusty surroundings and familiar bluish reflection nebulae aren't quite visible, while brighter Venus itself is almost overwhelming in the single exposure. And while Venus and the Sisters do look a little star-crossed, their spiky appearance is the diffraction pattern caused by multiple leaves in the aperture of the telephoto lens. The last similar conjunction of Venus and Pleiades occurred nearly 8 years ago.","venus, sister, wandering, brilliant, evening, star, crossing, path, pleiades, cluster, look, west, sunset, share, ongoing, conjunction, skygazers, world, taken, celestial, group, photo, capture, view, portal, arizona, bright, naked-eye, much, fainter, apparent, deeper, telescopic, image, dusty, surroundings, familiar, bluish, reflection, nebula, visible, brighter, overwhelming, single, exposure, little, star-crossed, spiky, appearance, diffraction, pattern, caused, multiple, leaf, aperture, telephoto, lens, last, similar, occurred, year"
Color the Universe,"Wouldn't it be fun to color in the universe? If you think so, please accept this famous astronomical illustration as a preliminary substitute.  You, your friends, your parents or children, can print it out or even color it digitally.  While coloring, you might be interested to know that even though this illustration has appeared in numerous places over the past 100 years, the actual artist remains unknown.  Furthermore, the work has no accepted name -- can you think of a good one?  The illustration, first appearing in a book by Camille Flammarion in 1888, is used frequently to show that humanity's present concepts are susceptible to being supplanted by greater truths.

NGC 1672: Barred Spiral Galaxy from Hubble,"Many spiral galaxies have bars across their centers.  Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar. Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 1672, featured here, was captured in spectacular detail in an image taken by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Visible are dark filamentary dust lanes, young clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bright bar of stars across the center, and a bright active nucleus that likely houses a supermassive black hole.  Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 1672, which spans about 75,000 light years across. NGC 1672, which appears toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish (Dorado), has been studied to find out how a spiral bar contributes to star formation in a galaxy's central regions.

A Path North,"What happens if you keep going north? The direction north on the Earth, the place on your horizon below the northern spin pole of the Earth -- around which other stars appear to slowly swirl, will remain the same. This spin-pole-of-the-north will never move from its fixed location on the sky -- night or day -- and its height will always match your latitude.  The further north you go, the higher the north spin pole will appear.  Eventually, if you can reach the Earth's North Pole, the stars will circle a point directly over your head.  Pictured, a four-hour long stack of images shows stars trailing in circles around this north celestial pole.  The bright star near the north celestial pole is Polaris, known as the North Star.  The bright path was created by the astrophotographer's headlamp as he zigzagged up a hill just over a week ago in Lower Saxony, Germany. The astrophotographer can be seen, at times, in shadow. Actually, the Earth has two spin poles -- and much the same would happen if you started below the Earth's equator and went south.","path, north, happens, keep, going, direction, earth, place, horizon, northern, spin, pole, star, appear, swirl, remain, spin-pole-of-the-north, move, fixed, location, night, height, match, latitude, higher, reach, circle, point, head, pictured, four-hour, long, stack, image, show, trailing, celestial, bright, polaris, known, created, astrophotographer, headlamp, zigzagged, hill, week, lower, saxony, germany, seen, time, shadow, happen, started, equator, went"
Country Sky versus City Sky,"Dark skies are disappearing from the world.  With modernization comes artificial lighting that brightens the night.  While these lights allow modern humans to see, much light is wasted up into the sky.  This light pollution not only wastes energy, but, when reflected by the Earth's atmosphere back down, creates a nighttime brightness that  disrupts wildlife and harms human health, while doing very little to prevent crime.  Light pollution is also making a dark night sky a scarcity for new generations.  While there is little that can be done in large cities, rural country areas could benefit from lighting that is fully shielded from exposing the night sky where it is not needed.  The featured panorama contains 6 adjacent vertical segments taken from different locations across Slovakia -- but with the same equipment and at the same time of night, and then subjected to the same digital post-processing.  Although no stars are visible on the left-most city sky, the right-most country sky is magnificently dark.  You can help protect the wonders of your night sky by favoring, when possible, dark sky friendly lighting.","country, versus, city, dark, disappearing, world, modernization, come, artificial, lighting, brightens, night, light, allow, modern, human, much, wasted, pollution, waste, energy, reflected, earth, atmosphere, creates, nighttime, brightness, disrupts, wildlife, harm, health, little, prevent, crime, making, scarcity, generation, done, large, rural, area, benefit, shielded, exposing, needed, featured, panorama, contains, adjacent, vertical, segment, taken, different, location, slovakia, equipment, time, subjected, digital, post-processing, star, visible, left-most, right-most, help, protect, wonder, favoring, possible, friendly"
A Flow of Time,"This surreal timelapse, landscape, panorama spans predawn, blue hour, and sunrise skies. Close to the start of planet Earth's northern hemisphere spring, the flow of time was captured between 4:30 and 7:00 am from a location overlooking northern New Mexico's Rio Grande Valley. In tracked images of the night sky just before twilight begins, the Milky Way is cast across the southern (right) edge of the panoramic frame. Toward the east, a range of short and long exposures resolves the changing brightness as the Sun rises over the distant peaks of the Sangre de Cristo Mountains. In between, exposures made during the spring morning's tantalizing blue hour are used to blend the night sky and sunrise over the high desert landscape.","flow, time, surreal, timelapse, landscape, panorama, span, predawn, blue, hour, sunrise, close, start, planet, earth, northern, hemisphere, spring, captured, location, overlooking, mexico, grande, valley, tracked, image, night, twilight, begin, milky, cast, southern, right, edge, panoramic, frame, east, range, short, long, exposure, resolve, changing, brightness, rise, distant, peak, sangre, mountain, made, morning, tantalizing, used, blend, high, desert"
Full Moon of Spring,"From home this Full Moon looked bright. Around our fair planet it rose as the Sun set on April 7/8, the first Full Moon after the vernal equinox and the start of northern hemisphere spring. April's full lunar phase was also near perigee, the closest point in the Moon's elliptical orbit. In fact, it was nearer perigee than any other Full Moon of 2020 making it the brightest Full Moon of the year. To create the visual experience a range of exposures was blended to capture the emerging foreground foliage and bright lunar disk. The hopefull image of spring was recorded from a home garden in skies over Chongqing, China.

Venus and the Pleiades in April,"Shared around world in early April skies Venus, our brilliant evening star, wandered across the face of the lovely Pleiades star cluster. This timelapse image follows the path of the inner planet during the beautiful conjunction showing its daily approach to the stars of the Seven Sisters. From a composite of tracked exposures made with a telephoto lens, the field of view is also appropriate for binocular equipped skygazers. While the star cluster and planet were easily seen with the naked-eye, the spiky appearance of our sister planet in the picture is the result of a diffraction pattern produced by the camera's lens. All images were taken from a home garden in Chiuduno, Bergamo, Lombardy, Italy, fortunate in good weather and clear spring nights.

The Horsehead Nebula in Infrared from Hubble,"While drifting through the cosmos, a magnificent interstellar dust cloud became sculpted by stellar winds and radiation to assume a recognizable shape.  Fittingly named the Horsehead Nebula, it is embedded in the vast and complex Orion Nebula (M42).  A potentially rewarding but difficult object to view personally with a small telescope, the above gorgeously detailed image was taken in 2013 in infrared light by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope in honor of the 23rd anniversary of Hubble's launch. The dark molecular cloud, roughly 1,500 light years distant, is cataloged as Barnard 33 and is seen above primarily because it is backlit by the nearby massive star Sigma Orionis. The Horsehead Nebula will slowly shift its apparent shape over the next few million years and will eventually be destroyed by the high energy starlight.

A Sailing Stone across Death Valley,"How did this big rock end up on this strange terrain? One of the more unusual places here on Earth occurs inside Death Valley, California, USA.  There a dried lakebed named Racetrack Playa exists that is almost perfectly flat, with the odd exception of some very large stones, one of which is pictured here in April of 2019 beneath a dark, Milky-Way filled sky.  Now the flatness and texture of large playa like Racetrack are fascinating but not scientifically puzzling -- they are caused by mud flowing, drying, and cracking after a heavy rain.  Only recently, however, has a viable scientific hypothesis been given to explain how heavy  sailing stones end up near the middle of such a large flat surface.  Unfortunately, as frequently happens in science, a seemingly surreal problem ends up having a relatively mundane solution.  It turns out that in winter thin floating ice sheets form in a rare ephemeral lake, and light winds push ice sections that then push even heavy rocks across the temporarily flooded playa when sunlight begins to melt the ice.","sailing, stone, death, valley, rock, strange, terrain, unusual, place, earth, occurs, california, dried, lakebed, named, racetrack, playa, exists, flat, exception, large, pictured, april, beneath, dark, milky-way, filled, flatness, texture, fascinating, puzzling, caused, flowing, drying, cracking, heavy, rain, viable, scientific, hypothesis, given, explain, middle, surface, happens, science, surreal, problem, mundane, solution, turn, winter, thin, floating, sheet, form, rare, ephemeral, lake, light, wind, push, section, flooded, sunlight, begin"
NGC 253: The Silver Coin Galaxy,"NGC 253 is one of the brightest spiral galaxies visible, but also one of the dustiest.  Dubbed the Silver Coin for its appearance in smalltelescopes, it is more formally known as the Sculptor Galaxy for its location within the boundaries of the southern constellation Sculptor.  Discovered in 1783 by mathematician and astronomer Caroline Herschel, the dusty island universe lies a mere 10 million light-years away. About 70 thousand light-years across, NGC 253, pictured, is the largest member of the Sculptor Group of Galaxies, the nearest to our own Local Group of galaxies.  In addition to its spiral dust lanes, tendrils of dust seem to be rising from a galactic disk laced with young star clusters and star forming regions in this sharp color image. The high dust content accompanies frantic star formation, earning NGC 253 the designation of a starburst galaxy. NGC 253 is also known to be a strong source of high-energy x-rays and gamma rays, likely due to massive black holes near the galaxy's center.

A Cosmic Triangle,"It was an astronomical triple play. Setting on the left, just after sunset near the end of last month, was our Moon -- showing a bright crescent phase.  Setting on the right was Venus, the brightest planet in the evening sky last month -- and this month, too.  With a small telescope, you could tell that Venus' phase was half, meaning that only half of the planet, as visible from Earth, was exposed to direct sunlight and brightly lit. High above and much further in the distance was the Pleiades star cluster.  Although the Moon and Venus move with respect to the background stars, the Pleiades do not -- because they are background stars. In the beginning of this month, Venus appeared to move right in front of the Pleiades, a rare event that happens only once every eight years.  The featured image captured this cosmic triangle with a series of exposures taken from the same camera over 70 minutes near Avonlea, Saskatchewan, Canada. The positions of the celestial objects was predicted. The only thing unpredicted was the existence of the foreground tree -- and the astrophotographer is still unsure what type of tree that is.","cosmic, triangle, astronomical, triple, play, setting, left, sunset, last, month, moon, showing, bright, crescent, phase, right, venus, brightest, planet, evening, small, telescope, tell, half, meaning, visible, earth, exposed, direct, sunlight, much, distance, pleiades, star, cluster, move, respect, background, beginning, appeared, rare, event, happens, year, featured, image, captured, series, exposure, taken, camera, minute, avonlea, saskatchewan, canada, position, celestial, object, predicted, thing, unpredicted, existence, foreground, tree, unsure, type"
Comet ATLAS Breaks Up,"Cruising through the inner solar system, Comet ATLAS (C/2019 Y4) has apparently fragmented. Multiple separate condensations within its diffuse coma are visible in this telescopic close-up from April 12, composed of frames tracking the comet's motion against trailing background stars. Discovered at the end of December 2019, this comet ATLAS showed a remarkably rapid increase in brightness in late March. Northern hemisphere comet watchers held out hope that it would become a bright naked-eye comet as it came closer to Earth in late April and May. But fragmenting ATLAS is slowly fading in northern skies. The breakup of comets is not uncommon though. This comet ATLAS is in an orbit similar to the Great Comet of 1844 (C/1844 Y1) and both may be fragments of a single larger comet.","comet, atlas, break, cruising, inner, solar, system, c/2019, fragmented, multiple, separate, condensation, diffuse, coma, visible, telescopic, close-up, april, composed, frame, tracking, motion, trailing, background, star, discovered, december, showed, rapid, increase, brightness, late, march, northern, held, hope, become, bright, naked-eye, came, earth, fragmenting, fading, breakup, uncommon, similar, great, c/1844, fragment, single, larger"
The Windmill and the Star Trails,"Stars can't turn these old wooden arms, but it does look like they might in this scene from a rotating planet. The well-composed night skyscape was recorded from Garafia, a municipality on the island of La Palma, Canary Islands, planet Earth. The center of the once working windmill, retired since 1953, is lined-up with the north celestial pole, the planet's rotation axis projected on to the northern sky. From a camera fixed to a tripod, the star trails are a reflection of the planet's rotation traced in a digital composite of 39 sequential exposures each 25 seconds long. Brought out by highlighting the final exposure in the sequence, the stars themselves appear at the ends of their short concentric arcs. A faint band of winter's Milky Way and even a diffuse glow from our neighboring Andromeda Galaxy also shine in the night.","windmill, star, trail, turn, wooden, look, scene, rotating, planet, well-composed, night, skyscape, recorded, garafia, municipality, island, canary, earth, center, working, retired, lined-up, north, celestial, pole, rotation, axis, projected, northern, camera, fixed, tripod, reflection, traced, digital, composite, sequential, exposure, second, brought, highlighting, final, sequence, appear, short, concentric, faint, band, winter, milky, glow, neighboring, andromeda, galaxy, shine"
Just Another Day on Aerosol Earth,"It was just another day on aerosol Earth. For August 23, 2018, the identification and distribution of aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere is shown in this dramatic, planet-wide digital visualization. Produced in real time, the Goddard Earth Observing System Forward Processing (GEOS FP) model relies on a combination of Earth-observing satellite and ground-based data to calculate the presence of types of aerosols, tiny solid particles and liquid droplets, as they circulate above the entire planet. This August 23rd model shows black carbon particles in red from combustion processes, like smoke from the fires in the United States and Canada, spreading across large stretches of North America and Africa. Sea salt aerosols are in blue, swirling above threatening typhoons near South Korea and Japan, and the hurricane looming near Hawaii. Dust shown in purple hues is blowing over African and Asian deserts.

Cassini Approaches Saturn,"What would it look like to approach Saturn in a spaceship? One doesn't have to just imagine -- the Cassini spacecraft did just this in 2004, recording thousands of images along the way, and hundreds of thousands more since entering orbit. Some of Cassini's early images have been digitally tweaked, cropped, and compiled into the featured inspiring video which is part of a larger developing IMAX movie project named In Saturn's Rings.  In the concluding sequence, Saturn looms increasingly large on approach as cloudy Titan swoops below. With Saturn whirling around in the background, Cassini is next depicted flying over Mimas, with large Herschel Crater clearly visible. Saturn's majestic rings then take over the show as Cassini crosses Saturn's thin ring plane. Dark shadows of the ring appear on Saturn itself. Finally, the enigmatic ice-geyser moon Enceladus appears in the distance and then is approached just as the video clip ends. After more than a decade of exploration and discovery, the Cassini spacecraft ran low on fuel in 2017 was directed to enter Saturn's atmosphere, where it surely melted.","cassini, approach, saturn, look, spaceship, imagine, spacecraft, recording, image, along, hundred, entering, orbit, early, tweaked, cropped, compiled, featured, inspiring, video, part, larger, developing, imax, movie, project, named, ring, concluding, sequence, loom, large, cloudy, titan, swoop, whirling, depicted, flying, herschel, crater, visible, majestic, take, show, cross, thin, plane, dark, shadow, appear, enigmatic, ice-geyser, moon, enceladus, appears, distance, approached, clip, decade, exploration, discovery, fuel, directed, atmosphere, melted"
IC 2944: The Running Chicken Nebula,"To some, it looks like a giant chicken running across the sky. To others, it looks like a gaseous nebula where star formation takes place. Cataloged as IC 2944, the Running Chicken Nebula spans about 100 light years and lies about 6,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Centaur (Centaurus).  The featured image, shown in scientifically assigned colors, was captured recently in a 12-hour exposure. The star cluster Collinder 249 is visible embedded in the nebula's glowing gas.

Eye on the Milky Way,"Have you ever had stars in your eyes? It appears that the eye on the left does, and moreover it appears to be gazing at even more stars. The featured 27-frame mosaic was taken last July from Ojas de Salar in the Atacama Desert of Chile.  The eye is actually a small lagoon captured reflecting the dark night sky as the Milky Way Galaxy arched overhead. The seemingly smooth band of the Milky Way is really composed of billions of stars, but decorated with filaments of light-absorbing dust and red-glowing nebulas. Additionally, both Jupiter (slightly left the galactic arch) and Saturn (slightly to the right) are visible.  The lights of small towns dot the unusual vertical horizon.  The rocky terrain around the lagoon appears to some more like the surface of Mars than our Earth.","milky, star, appears, left, moreover, gazing, featured, 27-frame, mosaic, taken, last, july, atacama, desert, chile, small, lagoon, captured, reflecting, dark, night, galaxy, arched, overhead, smooth, band, composed, decorated, filament, light-absorbing, dust, red-glowing, nebula, galactic, arch, saturn, right, visible, light, town, unusual, vertical, horizon, rocky, terrain, surface, earth"
Planet Earth at Twilight,"No sudden, sharp boundary marks the passage of day into night in this gorgeous view of ocean and clouds over our fair planet Earth. Instead, the shadow line or terminator is diffuse and shows the gradual transition to darkness we experience as twilight. With the Sun illuminating the scene from the right, the cloud tops reflect gently reddened sunlight filtered through the dusty troposphere, the lowest layer of the planet's nurturing atmosphere. A clear high altitude layer, visible along the dayside's upper edge, scatters blue sunlight and fades into the blackness of space.

Lyrid Meteor Streak,"rth's annual Lyrid Meteor Shower peaked before dawn yesterday, as our fair planet plowed through debris from the tail of long-period comet Thatcher. In crisp, clear and moonless predawn skies over Brown County, Indiana this streak of vaporizing comet dust briefly shared a telephoto field of view with stars and nebulae along the Milky Way. Alpha star of the constellation Cygnus, Deneb lies near the bright meteor's path along with the region's dark interstellar clouds of dust and the recognizable glow of the North America nebula (NGC 7000). The meteor's streak points back to the shower's radiant, its apparent point of origin on the sky. That would be in the constellation Lyra, near bright star Vega and off the top edge of the frame.

Hubble's Cosmic Reef,"These bright ridges of interstellar gas and dust are bathed in energetic starlight. With its sea of young stars, the massive star-forming region NGC 2014 has been dubbed the Cosmic Reef. Drifting just off shore, the smaller NGC 2020, is an expansive blue-hued structure erupting from a single central Wolf-Rayet star, 200,000 times brighter than the Sun. The cosmic frame spans some 600 light-years within the Large Magellanic Cloud 160,000 light-years away, a satellite galaxy of our Milky Way. A magnificent Hubble Space Telescope portrait, the image was released this week as part of a celebration to mark Hubble's 30th year exploring the Universe from Earth orbit.","hubble, cosmic, reef, bright, ridge, interstellar, dust, bathed, energetic, starlight, young, star, massive, star-forming, region, dubbed, drifting, smaller, expansive, blue-hued, structure, erupting, single, central, wolf-rayet, time, brighter, frame, span, light-year, large, magellanic, cloud, satellite, galaxy, milky, magnificent, space, telescope, portrait, image, released, week, part, celebration, mark, year, exploring, universe, earth, orbit"
Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe,"How big is our universe? This very question, among others, was debated by two leading astronomers 100 years ago today in what has become known as astronomy's Great Debate.  Many astronomers then believed that our Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.  Many others, though, believed that our galaxy was just one of many.  In the Great Debate, each argument was detailed, but no consensus was reached.  The answer came over three years later with the detected variation of single spot in the Andromeda Nebula, as shown on the original glass discovery plate digitally reproduced here. When Edwin Hubble compared images, he noticed that this spot varied, and so wrote ""VAR!"" on the plate.  The best explanation, Hubble knew, was that this spot was the image of a variable star that was very far away. So M31 was really the Andromeda Galaxy -- a galaxy possibly similar to our own.  The featured image may not be pretty, but the variable spot on it opened a door through which humanity gazed knowingly, for the first time, into a surprisingly vast cosmos.

Fresh Tiger Stripes on Saturn's Enceladus,"How will humanity first learn of extraterrestrial life? One possibility is to find it under the icy surface of Saturn's moon Enceladus. A reason to think that life may exist there are long features -- dubbed tiger stripes -- that are known to be spewing ice from the moon's icy interior into space. These surface cracks create clouds of fine ice particles over the moon's South Pole and create  Saturn's mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown from a close flyby.  The unusual surface tiger stripes are shown in false-color blue.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. A recent analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus' surface could contain life. Another Solar System moon that might contain underground life is Europa.

The Kepler-90 Planetary System,"Do other stars have planetary systems like our own? Yes -- one such system is Kepler-90. Cataloged by the  Kepler satellite that operated from Earth orbit between 2009 and 2018,  eight planets were discovered, giving Kepler-90 the same number of known planets as our Solar System. Similarities between Kepler-90 and our system include a G-type star comparable to our Sun, rocky planets comparable to our Earth, and large planets comparable in size to Jupiter and Saturn. Differences include that all of the known Kepler-90 planets orbit relatively close in -- closer than Earth's orbit around the Sun -- making them possibly too hot to harbor life. However, observations over longer time periods may discover cooler planets farther out. Kepler-90 lies about 2,500 light years away, and at magnitude 14 is visible with a medium-sized telescope toward the constellation of the Dragon (Draco).  The exoplanet-finding mission TESS was launched in 2018, while missions with exoplanet finding capability planned for launch in the next decade include NASA's JWST and WFIRST.

The Ion Tail of New Comet SWAN,"Newly discovered Comet SWAN has already developed an impressive tail.  The comet came in from the outer Solar System and has just passed inside the orbit of the Earth. Officially designated C/2020 F8 (SWAN), this outgassing interplanetary iceberg will pass its closest to the Earth on May 13, and closest to the Sun on May 27.  The comet was first noticed in late March by an astronomy enthusiast looking through images taken by ESA's and NASA's Sun-orbiting SOHO spacecraft, and is named for this spacecraft's Solar Wind Anisotropies (SWAN) camera. The featured image, taken from the dark skies in Namibia in mid-April, captured Comet SWAN's green-glowing coma and unexpectedly long, detailed, and blue ion-tail.   Although the brightness of comets are notoriously hard to predict, some models have Comet SWAN becoming bright enough to see with the unaided eye during June.

Andromeda Island Universe,"The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy some two and a half million light-years away. But without a telescope, even this immense spiral galaxy - spanning over 200,000 light years - appears as a faint, nebulous cloud in the constellation Andromeda. In contrast, a bright yellow nucleus, dark winding dust lanes, expansive blue spiral arms and star clusters are recorded in this stunning telescopic image. While even casual skygazers are now inspired by the knowledge that there are many distant galaxies like M31, astronomers debated this fundamental concept 100 years ago. Were these ""spiral nebulae"" simply outlying components of our own Milky Way Galaxy or were they instead ""island universes"", distant systems of stars comparable to the Milky Way itself? This question was central to the famous Shapley-Curtis debate of 1920, which was later resolved by observations of M31 in favor of Andromeda, island universe.

A View Toward M106,"Big, bright, beautiful spiral, Messier 106 dominates this cosmic vista. The nearly two degree wide telescopic field of view looks toward the well-trained constellation Canes Venatici, near the handle of the Big Dipper. Also known as NGC 4258, M106 is about 80,000 light-years across and 23.5 million light-years away, the largest member of the Canes II galaxy group. For a far far away galaxy, the distance to M106 is well-known in part because it can be directly measured by tracking this galaxy's remarkable maser, or microwave laser emission. Very rare but naturally occurring, the maser emission is produced by water molecules in molecular clouds orbiting its active galactic nucleus. Another prominent spiral galaxy on the scene, viewed nearly edge-on, is NGC 4217 below and right of M106. The distance to NGC 4217 is much less well-known, estimated to be about 60 million light-years, but the bright spiky stars are in the foreground, well inside our own Milky Way galaxy. Even the existence of galaxies beyond the Milky Way was questioned 100 years ago in astronomy's Great Debate.

"Radio, The Big Ear, and the Wow! Signal","Since the early days of radio and television we have been freely broadcasting signals into space. For some time now, we have been listening too. A large radio telescope at Ohio State University known as affectionately The Big Ear was one of the first listeners. The Big Ear was about the size of three football fields and consisted of an immense metal ground plane with two fence-like reflectors, one fixed and one tiltable. It relied on the Earth's rotation to help scan the sky. This photo, taken by former Big Ear student volunteer Rick Scott, looks out across the ground plane toward the fixed reflector with the radio frequency receiver horns in the foreground. Starting in 1965, the Big Ear was used in an ambitious survey of the radio sky. In the 1970s, it became the first telescope to continuously listen for signals from extraterrestrial civilizations. For an exciting moment during August 1977 a very strong, unexpected signal, dubbed the Wow! Signal, was detected by the Big Ear. But alas, heard only once, the source of the signal could not be determined. In May 1998 the final pieces of the Big Ear were torn down.

A Message from Earth,"What are these Earthlings trying to tell us?  The featured message was broadcast from Earth towards the globular star cluster M13 in 1974.  During the dedication of the Arecibo Observatory - still one of the largest single radio telescopes in the world - a string of 1's and 0's representing the diagram was sent.   This attempt at extraterrestrial communication was mostly ceremonial - humanity regularly broadcasts radio and television signals out into space accidentally.  Even were this message received, M13 is so far away we would have to wait almost 50,000 years to hear an answer.   The featured message gives a few simple facts about humanity and its knowledge: from left to right are numbers from one to ten, atoms including hydrogen and carbon, some interesting molecules, DNA, a human with description, basics of our Solar System, and basics of the sending telescope.

Earth Flyby of BepiColombo,"What it would look like to approach planet Earth?  Such an event was recorded visually in great detail by ESA's and JAXA's robotic BepiColombo spacecraft last month as it swung back past Earth on its journey in to the planet Mercury.  Earth can be seen rotating on approach as it comes out from behind the spacecraft's high-gain antenna in this nearly 10-hour time-lapse video.  The Earth is so bright that no background stars are visible.  Launched in 2018, the robotic BepiColombo used the gravity of Earth to adjust its course, the first of nine planetary flybys over the next seven years -- but the only one involving Earth. Scheduled to enter orbit in 2025, BepiColombo will take images and data of the surface and magnetic field of Mercury in an effort to better understand the early evolution of our Solar System and its innermost planet.

Carina in Perspective,"You need to be in the south, looking south, to see such a sky.  And only then if you're lucky.  Just above the picturesque tree is the impressive Carina Nebula, one of the few nebulas in the sky that is visible to the unaided eye.  The featured image had to be taken from a very dark location to capture the Carina Nebula with such perspective and so near the horizon.  The Great Nebula in Carina, cataloged as NGC 3372, is home to the wildly variable star Eta Carinae that sometimes flares to become one of the brightest stars in the sky.  Above Carina is IC 2944, the Running Chicken Nebula, a nebula that not only looks like a chicken, but contains impressive dark knots of dust.  Above these red-glowing emission nebulas are the bright stars of the Southern Cross, while on the upper left of the image is the dark Coalsack Nebula. This image was composed from six consecutive exposures taken last summer from Padre Bernardo, Goiás, Brazil.  Even with careful planning, the astrophotographer felt lucky to get this shot because clouds -- some still visible near the horizon -- kept getting in the way.

LDN 1471: A Windblown Star Cavity,"What is the cause of this unusual parabolic structure?  This illuminated cavity, known as LDN 1471, was created by a newly forming star, seen as the bright source at the peak of the parabola.  This protostar is experiencing a stellar outflow which is then interacting with the surrounding material in the Perseus Molecular Cloud, causing it to brighten.  We see only one side of the cavity -- the other side is hidden by dark dust.  The parabolic shape is caused by the widening of the stellar-wind blown cavity over time. Two additional structures can also be seen either side of the protostar, these are known as Herbig-Haro objects, again caused by the interaction of the outflow with the surrounding material.  What causes the striations on the cavity walls, though, remains unknown.  The featured image was taken by NASA and ESA’s Hubble Space Telescope after an original detection by the Spitzer Space Telescope.","windblown, star, cavity, cause, unusual, parabolic, structure, illuminated, known, created, forming, seen, bright, source, peak, parabola, protostar, experiencing, stellar, interacting, surrounding, material, perseus, molecular, cloud, causing, brighten, side, hidden, dark, dust, shape, caused, widening, stellar-wind, blown, time, additional, herbig-haro, object, interaction, striation, wall, remains, unknown, featured, image, taken, nasa, hubble, space, telescope, original, detection, spitzer"
Analemma of the Moon,"An analemma is that figure-8 curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun at the same time each day for one year. But the trick to imaging an analemma of the Moon is to wait bit longer. On average the Moon returns to the same position in the sky about 50 minutes and 29 seconds later each day. So photograph the Moon 50 minutes 29 seconds later on successive days. Over one lunation or lunar month it will trace out an analemma-like curve as the Moon's actual position wanders due to its tilted and elliptical orbit. To create this composite image of a lunar analemma, astronomer Gyorgy Soponyai chose a lunar month from March 26 to April 18 with a good stretch of weather and a site close to home near Mogyorod, Hungary. Crescent lunar phases too thin and faint to capture around the New Moon are missing though. Facing southwest, the lights of Budapest are in the distance of the base image taken on March 27.","analemma, moon, figure-8, curve, mark, position, time, year, trick, imaging, wait, longer, average, return, minute, second, photograph, successive, lunation, lunar, month, trace, analemma-like, actual, wanders, tilted, elliptical, orbit, create, composite, image, astronomer, gyorgy, soponyai, chose, march, april, good, stretch, weather, site, close, home, mogyorod, hungary, crescent, phase, thin, faint, capture, missing, facing, southwest, light, budapest, distance, base, taken"
Long Tailed Comet SWAN,"Blowing in the solar wind the spectacular ion tail of Comet SWAN (C/2020 F8) extends far across this 10 degree wide telephoto field of view. Captured on May 2 its greenish coma was about 6 light-minutes from Earth. The pretty background starfield lies near the border of the constellations Cetus and Aquarius. This comet SWAN was discovered at home by Australian amateur Michael Mattiazzo by checking images from the Sun-staring SOHO spacecraft's SWAN (Solar Wind ANisotropies) camera. The comet has now become just visible to the naked-eye as it sweeps from southern to northern skies.

Full Flower Moonrise,"Rising as the Sun set, the Moon was bright and full in planet Earth skies on May 7 and known to some as a Flower Moon. Near the horizon it does seem to take on rose pink hues of reddened sunlight in this reflective twilight scene. In fact one of the brighter Full Moons of the year, this month's full lunar phase occurred within about 32 hours of perigee. That's the closest point in the Moon's elliptical orbit.

The Porpoise Galaxy from Hubble,"What's happening to this spiral galaxy? Just a few hundred million years ago, NGC 2936, the upper of the two large galaxies shown, was likely a normal spiral galaxy -- spinning, creating stars -- and minding its own business. But then it got too close to the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 2937 below and took a dive. Dubbed the Porpoise Galaxy for its iconic shape, NGC 2936 is not only being deflected but also being distorted by the close gravitational interaction. A burst of young blue stars forms the nose of the porpoise toward the right of the upper galaxy, while the center of the spiral appears as an eye.  Alternatively, the galaxy pair, together known as Arp 142, look to some like a penguin protecting an egg. Either way, intricate dark dust lanes and bright blue star streams trail the troubled galaxy to the lower right. The featured re-processed image showing Arp 142 in unprecedented detail was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope last year. Arp 142 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation, coincidently, of the Water Snake (Hydra). In a billion years or so the two galaxies will likely merge into one larger galaxy.","porpoise, galaxy, hubble, happening, spiral, year, upper, large, shown, likely, normal, spinning, creating, star, minding, business, massive, elliptical, took, dive, dubbed, iconic, shape, deflected, distorted, close, gravitational, interaction, burst, young, blue, form, nose, right, center, appears, pair, known, look, penguin, protecting, intricate, dark, dust, lane, bright, stream, trail, troubled, lower, featured, re-processed, image, showing, unprecedented, detail, taken, space, telescope, last, light, constellation, water, snake, hydra, merge, larger"
Behind Betelgeuse,"What's behind Betelgeuse? One of the brighter and more unusual stars in the sky, the red supergiant star Betelgeuse can be found in the direction of famous constellation Orion. Betelgeuse, however, is actually well in front of many of the constellation's other bright stars, and also in front of the greater Orion Molecular Cloud Complex.  Numerically, light takes about 700 years to reach us from Betelgeuse, but about 1,300 years to reach us from the Orion Nebula and its surrounding dust and gas.  All but the largest telescopes see Betelgeuse as only a point of light, but a point so bright that the inherent blurriness created by the telescope and Earth's atmosphere make it seem extended.  In the featured long-exposure image, thousands of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy can be seen in the background behind Betelgeuse, as well as dark dust from the Orion Molecular Cloud, and some red-glowing emission from hydrogen gas on the outskirts of the more distant Lambda Orionis Ring. Betelgeuse has recovered from appearing unusually dim over the past six months, but is still expected to explode in a spectacular supernova sometime in the next (about) 100,000 years.","betelgeuse, brighter, unusual, star, supergiant, found, direction, famous, constellation, orion, front, many, bright, greater, molecular, cloud, complex, light, take, year, reach, surrounding, dust, largest, telescope, point, inherent, blurriness, created, earth, atmosphere, make, seem, extended, featured, long-exposure, image, milky, galaxy, seen, background, dark, red-glowing, emission, hydrogen, outskirt, distant, lambda, orionis, ring, recovered, appearing, month, expected, explode, spectacular, supernova, next"
Lyrid Meteors from the Constellation Lyra,"Where are all of these meteors coming from?  In terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the constellation of Small Harp (Lyra).  That is why the famous meteor shower that peaks every April is known as the Lyrids -- the meteors all appear to came from a radiant toward Lyra. In terms of parent body, though, the sand-sized debris that makes up the Lyrid meteors come from Comet Thatcher. The comet follows a well-defined orbit around our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches Earth is superposed in front of Lyra. Therefore, when Earth crosses this orbit, the radiant point of falling debris appears in Lyra. Featured here, a composite image containing over 33 meteors (can you find them all?) from last month's  Lyrid meteor shower shows several bright meteors that streaked over a shore of Seč Lake in the Czech Republic.

Jupiter in Infrared from Gemini,"In infrared, Jupiter lights up the night.  Recently, astronomers at the Gemini North Observatory in Hawaii, USA, created some of the best infrared photos of Jupiter ever taken from Earth’s surface, pictured.  Gemini was able to produce such a clear image using a technique called lucky imaging, by taking many images and combining only the clearest ones that, by chance, were taken when Earth's atmosphere was the most calm.  Jupiter’s jack-o’-lantern-like appearance is caused by the planet’s different layers of clouds.  Infrared light can pass through clouds better than visible light, allowing us to see deeper, hotter layers of Jupiter's atmosphere, while the thickest clouds appear dark.  These pictures, together with ones from the Hubble Space Telescope and the Juno spacecraft, can tell us a lot about weather patterns on Jupiter, like where its massive, planet-sized storms form.

Comet Halley vs Comet SWAN,"The pre-dawn hours of May 3rd were moonless as grains of cosmic dust streaked through southern skies above Reunion Island. Swept up as planet Earth plowed through dusty debris streams left behind periodic Comet 1/P Halley, the annual meteor shower is known as the Eta Aquarids. This inspired exposure captures a bright aquarid meteor flashing left to right over a sea of clouds. The meteor streak points back to the shower's radiant in the constellation Aquarius, well above the eastern horizon and off the top of the frame. Known for speed Eta Aquarid meteors move fast, entering the atmosphere at about 66 kilometers per second, visible at altitudes of 100 kilometers or so. Then about 6 light-minutes from Earth, the pale greenish coma and long tail of Comet C/2020 F8 SWAN were not to be left out of the celestial scene, posing above the volcanic peaks left of center.

On the left, with grand spiral arms and bright yellow core is spiral galaxy M81, some 100,000 light-years across.  On the right marked by red gas and dust clouds, is irregular galaxy M82.  The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years. Gravity from each galaxy has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters.  Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81's spiral arms.  M82 was left with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic the galaxy glows in X-rays.  In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a single galaxy will remain.","galaxy, light-year, distant, northern, constellation, great, bear, left, grand, spiral, bright, yellow, core, right, marked, dust, cloud, irregular, pair, locked, gravitational, combat, year, gravity, affected, series, cosmic, close, encounter, last, go-round, lasted, raised, density, wave, rippling, resulting, richness, violent, star, forming, region, colliding, energetic, glow, x-ray, next, continuing, result, merger, single, remain"
The Dark River to Antares,"A dark river seems to flow through this sky from the horizon toward colorful clouds near red giant star Antares. Murky looking, the dark river is a dusty nebula obscuring background starlight near the central Milky Way, although the dark dust nebula contains mostly hydrogen molecular gas.  Dust scattering starlight around Antares, alpha star of Scorpius, creates the unusual yellow-hued reflection nebula. Above it, bright blue double star Rho Ophiuchi is embedded in more typical dusty bluish reflection nebulae, with red emission nebulae also scattered through the interstellar space. Globular star cluster M4 looks almost like a bright star just above and right of Antares, though it lies far behind the colorful clouds, at a distance of some 7,000 light-years. The dark river itself is about 500 light years away.  To create the startling night sky view, all background and foreground exposures were made back to back with the same camera and telephoto lens on the same night from the same location. In combination they produce a stunning image that reveals a range of brightness and color that your eye can't quite perceive. Recorded in the early hours of January 31, the composite also captures Mars still near the eastern horizon and rising to join rival Antares on the celestial stage. Bright Mars and its watery reflection are left of a lonely tree in the Bosque del Apache National Wildlife Refuge, New Mexico, planet Earth.","dark, river, antares, seems, flow, horizon, colorful, cloud, giant, star, murky, looking, dusty, nebula, obscuring, background, starlight, central, milky, dust, contains, hydrogen, molecular, scattering, alpha, scorpius, creates, unusual, yellow-hued, reflection, bright, blue, double, ophiuchi, embedded, typical, bluish, emission, scattered, interstellar, space, globular, cluster, look, right, distance, light-year, light, year, create, startling, night, view, foreground, exposure, made, camera, telephoto, lens, location, combination, produce, stunning, image, reveals, range, brightness, color, quite, perceive, recorded, hour, january, composite, capture, eastern, rising, join, rival, celestial, stage, watery, left, tree, bosque, national, wildlife, refuge, mexico, planet, earth"
A Waterspout in Florida,"What's happening over the water?  Pictured here is one of the better images yet recorded of a waterspout, a type of tornado that occurs over water.  Waterspouts are spinning columns of rising moist air that typically form over warm water. Waterspouts can be as dangerous as tornadoes and can feature wind speeds over 200 kilometers per hour.  Some waterspouts form away from thunderstorms and even during relatively fair weather.  Waterspouts may be relatively transparent and initially visible only by an unusual pattern they create on the water.  The featured image was taken in 2013 July near Tampa Bay, Florida. The Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida is arguably the most active area in the world for waterspouts, with hundreds forming each year.

Journey into the Cosmic Reef,"What would you see if you could fly into the Cosmic Reef? The nebular cloud NGC 2014 appear to some like an ocean reef that resides in the sky, specifically in the LMC, the largest satellite galaxy of our Milky Way Galaxy. A detailed image of this distant nebula was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope to help commemorate 30 years of investigating the cosmos.  Data and images of this cosmic reef have been combined into the three-dimensional model flown through in the featured video.  The computer animated sequence first takes you past a star cluster highlighted by bright blue stars, below pillars of gas and dust slowly being destroyed by the energetic light and winds emitted by these massive stars.  Filaments of gas and dust are everywhere, glowing in the red light of hydrogen and nitrogen. The animation next takes you to the blue-colored nebula NGC 2020, glowing in light emitted by oxygen and surrounding a Wolf-Rayet star about 200,000 times brighter than our Sun -- a nebula thought to be the ejected outer atmosphere of this stellar monster.  As the animation concludes, the virtual camera pivots to show that NGC 2020 has a familiar hourglass shape when viewed from the side.

Moreover, this NASA page has, typically, several more posters of each of the Solar System objects depicted.  These posters highlight many of the places humanity, through NASA, has explored in the past 50 years, including our Sun, and planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune. Moons of Jupiter that have been posterized include Europa, Ganymede, Callisto, and Io, while moons of Saturn that can be framed include Enceladus and Titan.  Images of Pluto, Ceres, comets and asteroids are also presented, while six deep space scenes -- well beyond our Solar System -- can also be prominently displayed.

"Moon, Mars, Saturn, Jupiter, Milky Way","It is not a coincidence that planets line up. That's because all of the planets orbit the Sun in (nearly) a single sheet called the plane of the ecliptic. When viewed from inside that plane -- as Earth dwellers are likely to do -- the planets all appear confined to a single band. It is a coincidence, though, when three of the brightest planets all appear in nearly the same direction.  Such a coincidence was captured about a month ago. Featured above, Earth's Moon, Mars, Saturn, and Jupiter were all imaged together, just before sunrise, from the Black Sea coast of Bulgaria.  A second band is visible diagonally across this image -- the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy. If you wake up early, you will find that these same planets remain visible in the morning sky this month, too.

Phases of Venus,"Just as the Moon goes through phases, Venus' visible sunlit hemisphere waxes and wanes. This composite of backyard telescopic images illustrates the steady changes for Venus during its current stint as our evening star, as the inner planet grows larger but narrows to a thin crescent. Images from bottom to top were taken during 2020 on dates February 27, March 20, April 14, April 24, May 8, and May 14. Gliding along its interior orbit between Earth and Sun, Venus grows larger during that period because it is approaching planet Earth. Its crescent narrows, though, as Venus swings closer to our line-of-sight to the Sun. Closest to the Earth-Sun line but passing about 1/2 degree north of the Sun on June 3, Venus will reach a (non-judgmental) inferior conjunction. Soon after, Venus will shine clearly above the eastern horizon in predawn skies as planet Earth's morning star. After sunset tonight look for Venus above the western horizon and you can also spot elusive innermost planet Mercury.","phase, venus, moon, visible, sunlit, wane, composite, backyard, telescopic, image, illustrates, steady, change, current, stint, evening, star, inner, planet, grows, larger, narrow, thin, crescent, bottom, taken, date, february, march, april, gliding, interior, orbit, earth, period, approaching, swing, line-of-sight, closest, earth-sun, line, passing, degree, north, june, reach, non-judgmental, inferior, conjunction, shine, eastern, horizon, predawn, morning, sunset, tonight, look, western, spot, elusive, innermost, mercury"
South of Carina,"With natal dust clouds in silhouette against glowing atomic gas, this colorful and chaotic vista lies within one of the largest star forming regions in the Milky Way galaxy, the Great Carina Nebula. The telescopic close-up frames a field of view about 80 light-years across, a little south and east of Eta Carinae, the nebula's most energetic and enigmatic star. Captured under suburban skies improved during national restrictions, a composite of narrowband image data was used to create the final image. In it, characteristic emission from the nebula's ionized sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms is mapped to red, green, and blue hues, a color palette also popular in Hubble Space Telescope images. The celestial landscape of bright ridges of emission bordered by cool, obscuring dust lies about 7,500 light-years away toward the southern constellation Carina.","south, carina, natal, dust, cloud, silhouette, glowing, atomic, colorful, chaotic, vista, largest, star, forming, region, galaxy, great, nebula, telescopic, close-up, frame, field, view, light-year, across, little, east, energetic, enigmatic, captured, suburban, improved, national, restriction, composite, narrowband, image, data, used, create, final, characteristic, emission, ionized, sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, atom, mapped, green, blue, color, palette, popular, hubble, space, telescope, celestial, landscape, bright, ridge, bordered, cool, obscuring, southern, constellation"
Ghost Fungus to Magellanic Cloud,"Stars shine and satellites glint in this clear, dark, night sky over Wannon Falls Reserve, South West Victoria, Australia. In fact the fuzzy, faint apparition above the tree tops is the only cloud visible, also known as the Large Magellanic Cloud, satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way. In the foreground, an Omphalotus nidiformis (ghost fungus) from planet Earth shines with a surprisingly bright bioluminescence. Like the Magellanic cloud, the ghost fungus was easily seen with the eye. Its ghostly glow was actually a dull green, but it appears bright green in digital camera picture. Two images were blended to create the scene. One focused on the distant stars and Large Magellanic Cloud some 160,000 light-years away. Another was focused on the foreground and glowing fungus several light-nanoseconds from the camera lens.","ghost, fungus, magellanic, cloud, star, shine, satellite, glint, clear, dark, night, wannon, fall, reserve, south, west, victoria, australia, fact, fuzzy, faint, apparition, tree, visible, known, large, galaxy, milky, foreground, nidiformis, planet, earth, bright, bioluminescence, seen, glow, dull, green, appears, digital, camera, picture, image, blended, create, scene, focused, distant, light-year, glowing, several, light-nanoseconds, lens"
Valles Marineris: The Grand Canyon of Mars,"The largest canyon in the Solar System cuts a wide swath across the face of Mars.  Named Valles Marineris, the grand valley extends over 3,000 kilometers long, spans as much as 600 kilometers across, and delves as much as 8 kilometers deep.  By comparison, the Earth's Grand Canyon in Arizona, USA is 800 kilometers long, 30 kilometers across, and 1.8 kilometers deep.  The origin of the Valles Marineris remains unknown, although a leading hypothesis holds that it started as a crack billions of years ago as the planet cooled.  Several geologic processes have been identified in the canyon.  The featured mosaic was  created from over 100 images of Mars taken by Viking Orbiters in the 1970s.","valles, marineris, grand, canyon, largest, solar, system, wide, swath, face, named, valley, extends, kilometer, much, delf, deep, comparison, earth, arizona, origin, remains, unknown, leading, hypothesis, hold, started, crack, year, planet, cooled, several, geologic, process, identified, featured, created, image, taken, viking"
Mystic Mountain Monster being Destroyed,"Inside the head of this interstellar monster is a star that is slowly destroying it.  The huge monster, actually an inanimate series of pillars of gas and dust, measures light years in length.  The in-head star is not itself visible through the opaque interstellar dust but is bursting out partly by ejecting opposing beams of energetic particles called Herbig-Haro jets.  Located about 7,500 light years away in the Carina Nebula and known informally as Mystic Mountain, the appearance of these pillars is dominated by dark dust even though they are composed mostly of clear hydrogen gas.  The featured image was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope. All over these pillars, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the dusty stellar nurseries in which they formed.  Within a few million years, the head of this giant, as well as most of its body, will have been completely evaporated by internal and surrounding stars.

The Milky Way over Snow-Capped Himalayas,"What’s higher than the Himalayas? Although the Himalayan Mountains are the tallest on planet Earth, they don't measure up to the Milky Way. Visible above the snow-capped mountains in the featured image is the arcing central band of our home galaxy.  The bright spot just above the central plane is the planet Jupiter, while the brightest orange spot on the upper right is the star Antares.  The astrophotographer braved below-zero temperatures at nearly 4,000-meters altitude to take the photographs that compose this image.  The featured picture is a composite of eight exposures taken with same camera and from the same location over three hours, just after sunset, in 2019 April, from near Bimtang Lake in Nepal.

Earth and Moon through Saturn's Rings,"What are those dots between Saturn's rings? Our Earth and Moon. Just over three years ago, because the Sun was temporarily blocked by the body of Saturn, the robotic Cassini spacecraft was able to look toward the inner Solar System. There, it spotted our Earth and Moon -- just pin-pricks of light lying about 1.4 billion kilometers distant. Toward the right of the featured image is Saturn's A ring, with the broad Encke Gap on the far right and the narrower Keeler Gap toward the center.  On the far left is Saturn's continually changing F Ring.  From this perspective, the light seen from Saturn's rings was scattered mostly forward , and so appeared backlit.  After more than a decade of exploration and discovery, the Cassini spacecraft ran low on fuel in 2017 and was directed to enter Saturn's atmosphere, where it surely melted.

Reflecting the International Space Station,"Still bathed in sunlight, the International Space Station arced through the evening sky over lake Wulfsahl-Gusborn in northern Germany, just after sunset on March 25. The familiar constellation of Orion can be seen left of the trail of the orbital station's bright passage. On the right, Venus is the brilliant evening star above the western horizon. With the camera fixed to a tripod, this scene was captured in a series of five exposures. How can you tell? The short time delay between the end of one exposure and the beginning of the next leaves small gaps in the ISS light trail. Look closely and you'll also see that the sky that appears to be above the horizon is actually a reflection though. The final image has been vertically inverted and the night skyscape recorded in the mirror-like waters of the small lake.","reflecting, international, space, station, bathed, sunlight, arced, evening, lake, wulfsahl-gusborn, northern, germany, sunset, march, familiar, constellation, orion, seen, left, trail, orbital, bright, passage, venus, brilliant, star, western, horizon, camera, fixed, tripod, scene, captured, series, exposure, tell, short, time, delay, beginning, next, leaf, small, light, look, appears, reflection, final, image, inverted, night, skyscape, recorded, mirror-like, water"
Mercury Meets Crescent Venus,"That's not a bright star and crescent Moon caught between branches of a eucalyptus tree. It's Venus in a crescent phase and Mercury. Near the western horizon after sunset, the two inner planets closely shared this telescopic field of view on May 22, seen from a balcony in Civitavecchia, Italy. Venus, the very bright celestial beacon, is wandering lower into the evening twilight. It grows larger in apparent size and shows a thinner crescent as it heads toward its inferior conjunction, positioned between Earth and Sun on June 3. Mercury, in a fuller phase, is climbing in the western sky though, reaching its maximum angular distance from the Sun on June 4 Still, this remarkably close pairing with brilliant Venus made Mercury, usually lost in bright twilight skies, easier to spot from planet Earth.

"Green Flashes: Sun, Moon, Venus, Mercury","Follow a sunset on a clear day against a distant horizon and you might glimpse green just as the Sun disappears from view. The green flash is caused by refraction of light rays traveling to the eye over a long path through the atmosphere. Shorter wavelengths refract more strongly than longer redder wavelengths and the separation of colors lends a green hue to the last visible vestige of the solar disk. It's harder to see a green flash from the Moon, not to mention the diminutive disks of Venus and Mercury. But a telescope or telephoto lens and camera can help catch this tantalizing result of atmospheric refraction when the celestial bodies are near the horizon. From Sicily, the top panels were recorded on March 18, 2019 for the Sun and May 8, 2020 for the Moon. Also from the Mediterranean island, the bottom panels were shot during the twilight apparition of Venus and Mercury near the western horizon on May 24.","green, flash, moon, venus, mercury, follow, sunset, clear, distant, horizon, glimpse, disappears, view, caused, refraction, light, traveling, long, path, shorter, wavelength, refract, redder, separation, color, lends, last, visible, vestige, solar, disk, harder, mention, diminutive, telescope, telephoto, lens, camera, help, catch, tantalizing, result, atmospheric, celestial, body, panel, recorded, mediterranean, island, bottom, shot, twilight, apparition, western"
Aurora over Sweden,"It was bright and green and stretched across the sky. This striking aurora display was captured in 2016 just outside of Östersund, Sweden. Six photographic fields were merged to create the featured panorama spanning almost 180 degrees.  Particularly striking aspects of this aurora include its sweeping arc-like shape and its stark definition.  Lake Storsjön is seen in the foreground, while several familiar constellations and the star Polaris are visible through the aurora, far in the background.  Coincidently, the aurora appears to avoid the Moon visible on the lower left.  The aurora appeared a day after a large hole opened in the Sun's corona allowing particularly energetic particles to flow out into the Solar System.  The green color of the aurora is caused by oxygen atoms recombining with ambient electrons high in the Earth's atmosphere.","aurora, sweden, bright, green, stretched, striking, display, captured, östersund, photographic, field, merged, create, featured, panorama, spanning, degree, aspect, include, sweeping, arc-like, shape, stark, definition, lake, storsjön, seen, foreground, several, familiar, constellation, star, polaris, visible, appears, avoid, moon, lower, left, appeared, large, hole, opened, corona, allowing, energetic, particle, flow, solar, system, color, caused, oxygen, atom, recombining, ambient, high, earth, atmosphere"
The Lively Center of the Lagoon Nebula,"The center of the Lagoon Nebula is a whirlwind of spectacular star formation. Visible near the image center, at least two long funnel-shaped clouds, each roughly half a light-year long, have been formed by extreme stellar winds and intense energetic starlight.  A tremendously bright nearby star, Herschel 36, lights the area.  Vast walls of dust hide and redden other hot young stars.  As energy from these stars pours into the cool dust and gas, large temperature differences in adjoining regions can be created generating shearing winds which may cause the funnels.  This picture, spanning about 15 light years, features two colors detected by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  The Lagoon Nebula, also known as M8, lies about 5000 light years distant toward the constellation of the Archer Sagittarius.","center, lagoon, nebula, spectacular, star, formation, visible, image, least, long, funnel-shaped, cloud, light-year, formed, extreme, stellar, wind, intense, energetic, starlight, bright, nearby, herschel, light, area, wall, dust, hide, redden, young, energy, pours, cool, large, temperature, difference, adjoining, region, created, generating, shearing, cause, funnel, picture, spanning, year, feature, color, detected, orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, known, distant, constellation, archer, sagittarius"
Novel Coronavirus Attacks Humanity,"Humanity is under attack. The attack is not from large tentacle-flailing aliens, but from invaders so small they can barely be seen, and so strange they are not even clearly alive.  All over planet Earth, the human home world, DNA-based humans are being invaded by the RNA-based SARS-CoV2.  The virus, which creates a disease known as  COVID-19, specializes in reprogramming human cells into zombies that manufacture and release copies of itself.   Pictured here is a high magnification image of a human cell covered by attacking novel coronavirus SARS-CoV2 (orange).  Epic battles where two species square off in a fight to the death are not unusual on Earth, with several just involving humans typically ongoing at any time.  Even so, most humans are predicted to survive.

The Dance of Venus and Earth,"very time Venus passes the Earth, it shows the same face.  This remarkable fact has been known for only about 50 years, ever since radio telescopes have been able to peer beneath Venus' thick clouds and track its slowly rotating surface.  This inferior conjunction -- when Venus and Earth are the closest -- occurs today.  The featured animation shows the positions of the Sun, Venus and Earth between 2010-2023 based on NASA-downloaded data, while a mock yellow 'arm' has been fixed to the ground on Venus to indicate rotation.  The reason for this unusual 1.6-year resonance is the gravitational influence that Earth has on Venus, which surprisingly dominates the Sun's tidal effect.  If Venus could be seen through the Sun's glare today, it would show just a very slight sliver of a crescent. Although previously visible in the evening sky, starting tomorrow, Venus will appear in the morning sky -- on the other side of the Sun as viewed from Earth.

Portrait of NGC 3628,"Sharp telescopic views of NGC 3628 show a puffy galactic disk divided by dark dust lanes. Of course, this deep portrait of the magnificent, edge-on spiral galaxy puts some astronomers in mind of its popular moniker, the Hamburger Galaxy. It also reveals a small galaxy nearby, likely a satellite of NGC 3628, and a faint but extensive tidal tail. The drawn out tail stretches for about 300,000 light-years, even beyond the right edge of the wide frame. NGC 3628 shares its neighborhood in the local universe with two other large spirals M65 and M66 in a grouping otherwise known as the Leo Triplet. Gravitational interactions with its cosmic neighbors are likely responsible for creating the tidal tail, as well as the extended flare and warp of this spiral's disk. The tantalizing island universe itself is about 100,000 light-years across and 35 million light-years away in the northern springtime constellation Leo.","portrait, sharp, telescopic, view, show, puffy, galactic, disk, divided, dark, dust, lane, course, deep, magnificent, edge-on, spiral, galaxy, mind, popular, moniker, hamburger, reveals, small, likely, satellite, faint, extensive, tidal, tail, drawn, stretch, light-year, right, edge, wide, frame, share, neighborhood, local, universe, large, grouping, known, triplet, gravitational, interaction, cosmic, neighbor, responsible, creating, extended, flare, warp, tantalizing, island, northern, springtime, constellation"
Dragon over Central Park,"Still bathed in sunlight the International Space Station (ISS) arced through this Manhattan evening sky on May 30. Moving left to right, its bright trail was captured in this composite image with a series of 5 second long exposures. Stars left short trails and lights were reflected in still waters looking toward the north across the Central Park reservoir. Chasing the ISS in low Earth orbit the Crew Dragon spacecraft dubbed Endeavour also left a trail through that urban night.

Comet PanSTARRs and the Galaxies,"Comet PanSTARRs, C/2017 T2, shared this stunning telescopic field of view with galaxies M81 and M82 on May 22/23. Of course, the galaxies were some 12 million light-years distant and the comet about 14 light-minutes away, seen in planet Earth's sky toward the Big Dipper. A new visitor from the Oort Cloud, this Comet PanSTARRs was discovered in 2017 by the PanSTARRs survey telescope when the comet was over 1 light-hour from the Sun, almost as distant as the orbit of Saturn. With a beautiful coma and dust tail, this comet has been a solid northern hemisphere performer for telescope wielding comet watchers this May, following its closest approach to the Sun on May 4. In this deep image from dark California skies the outbound comet even seems to develop a short anti-tail as it leaves the inner Solar System.","comet, panstarrs, galaxy, c/2017, shared, stunning, telescopic, field, view, course, light-year, distant, light-minutes, seen, planet, earth, dipper, visitor, oort, cloud, discovered, survey, telescope, light-hour, orbit, saturn, beautiful, coma, dust, tail, solid, northern, hemisphere, performer, wielding, watcher, following, closest, approach, deep, image, dark, california, seems, develop, short, anti-tail, leaf, inner, solar, system"
Halo of the Cat's Eye,"The Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae in the sky. Its haunting symmetries are seen in the very central region of this stunning false-color picture, processed to reveal the enormous but extremely faint halo of gaseous material, over three light-years across, which surrounds the brighter, familiar planetary nebula. Made with data from the Nordic Optical Telescope in the Canary Islands, the composite picture shows extended emission from the nebula. Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a Sun-like star. Only much more recently however, have some planetaries been found to have halos like this one, likely formed of material shrugged off during earlier active episodes in the star's evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of this halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.","halo, nebula, known, planetary, haunting, symmetry, seen, central, region, stunning, false-color, picture, processed, enormous, faint, gaseous, material, light-year, surround, brighter, familiar, made, data, nordic, optical, telescope, canary, island, composite, show, extended, emission, appreciated, final, phase, life, sun-like, star, planetaries, found, formed, shrugged, active, episode, evolution, thought, last, year, astronomer, estimate, filamentary, portion"
Atmospheric Ring of Venus,"Why is Venus surrounded by a bright ring? Sometimes called a ring of fire, this rare ring is caused by the Sun's light being visible all around an object. Usually seen around the Moon during an annular solar eclipse, the ring of fire is also visible when either Venus or Mercury cross the face of our Sun.  In the featured pictured taken last week, though, Venus did not pass directly in front of the Sun -- the complete atmospheric ring was caused by sunlight scattering around the planet. Venus passed within one degree of the Sun during its inferior conjunction, as it moved from the evening to the morning sky.  The extreme brightness of the nearby Sun made capturing such an image very difficult -- the featured image was only made possible by using a temporary filter to block direct sunlight. The image was captured from Thorton, Leicestershire, UK. The pervasive blue sky glow indicates that the image was actually captured during the day.

Orion over Argentine Mountains,"Do you recognize the constellation of Orion?  It may be harder than usual in today's featured image  because the camera has zoomed in on the center, and the exposure is long enough to enhance nebulas beyond what the unaided human eye can see.  Still, once you become oriented, you can see Orion's three belt stars lined up vertically near the image center, and even locate the familiar Orion Nebula on the upper left.  Famous faint features that are also visible include the dark Horsehead Nebula indentation near the image center, and the dusty Flame Nebula just to its right. Part of the Orion-encircling Barnard's Loop can also be found on the far right.  The image combines multiple sky-tracking shots of the background in different colors with a single static foreground exposure taken at twilight -- all captured with the same camera and from the same location.  The picturesque scene was captured early last year from mountains in San Juan, Argentina.

Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1300,"Big, beautiful, barred spiral galaxy NGC 1300 lies some 70 million light-years away on the banks of the constellation Eridanus. This Hubble Space Telescope composite view of the gorgeous island universe is one of the largest Hubble images ever made of a complete galaxy. NGC 1300 spans over 100,000 light-years and the Hubble image reveals striking details of the galaxy's dominant central bar and majestic spiral arms. In fact, on close inspection the nucleus of this classic barred spiral itself shows a remarkable region of spiral structure about 3,000 light-years across. Like other spiral galaxies, including our own Milky Way, NGC 1300 is thought to have a supermassive central black hole.","barred, spiral, galaxy, beautiful, light-year, bank, constellation, hubble, space, telescope, composite, view, gorgeous, island, universe, largest, image, made, complete, span, reveals, striking, detail, dominant, central, majestic, fact, close, inspection, nucleus, classic, show, remarkable, region, structure, including, milky, thought, supermassive, black, hole"
NGC 2359: Thor's Helmet,"NGC 2359 is a helmet-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages popularly called Thor's Helmet. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the helmet is more like an interstellar bubble, blown as a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center inflates a region within the surrounding molecular cloud. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away in the constellation of the Great Overdog. The remarkably sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from broadband and narrowband filters using three different telescopes. It captures natural looking stars and the details of the nebula's filamentary structures.

SpaceX Demo-2 Launch,"Clouds are white but the sky is dark in this snapshot of Launch Complex 39A at the Kennedy Space Center.  The dramatic daytime sky is partly due to the black and white photo captured with a digital camera at near-infrared wavelengths. Taken at 3:22 p.m. EDT Saturday May 30 the launch was pretty dramatic too as a Falcon 9 rocket lofted a Crew Dragon spacecraft towards low-Earth orbit. Astronauts Robert Behnken and Douglas Hurley were onboard, the first crew launched from a United States spaceport since the conclusion of the Space Shuttle Program in 2011. A few minutes after launch, the Falcon 9 first stage returned to land on Of Course I Still Love You (that's an autonomous spaceport drone ship ...) patiently waiting off the Florida coast.

Happy People Dancing on Planet Earth,"What are these humans doing?  Dancing.  Many humans on Earth exhibit periods of happiness, and one method of displaying happiness is dancing. Happiness and dancing transcend national boundaries and occur in practically every human society. Above, Matt Harding traveled through many nations on Earth, planned on dancing, and filmed the result.  The featured video, one in a series of similar videos, is perhaps a dramatic example that humans from all over planet Earth feel a common bond as part of a single species.

A Ring of Fire Sunrise Solar Eclipse,"What's rising above the horizon behind those clouds? It's the Sun.  Most sunrises don't look like this, though, because most sunrises don't include the Moon. In the early morning of 2013 May 10, however, from Western Australia, the Moon was between the Earth and the rising Sun.  At times, it would be hard for the uninformed to understand what was happening.  In an annular eclipse, the Moon is too far from the Earth to block the entire Sun, and at most leaves a ring of fire where sunlight pours out around every edge of the Moon.  The featured time-lapse video also recorded the eclipse through the high refraction of the Earth's atmosphere just above the horizon, making the unusual rising Sun and Moon appear also flattened.  As the video continues on, the Sun continues to rise, and the Sun and Moon begin to separate.  This weekend, a new annular solar eclipse will occur, visible from central Africa, the Arabian Peninsula, and a narrow band across Asia, with much of Earth's Eastern hemisphere being able to see a partial solar eclipse.","ring, fire, sunrise, solar, eclipse, rising, horizon, cloud, look, include, early, morning, western, australia, moon, earth, time, hard, uninformed, understand, happening, annular, block, entire, leaf, sunlight, pours, edge, featured, time-lapse, video, recorded, high, refraction, atmosphere, making, unusual, appear, flattened, continues, rise, begin, separate, weekend, occur, visible, central, africa, arabian, peninsula, narrow, band, much, eastern, hemisphere, able, partial"
APOD is 25 Years Old Today,"Welcome to the quadranscentennial year of the Astronomy Picture of the Day.  Perhaps a source of consistency for some, APOD is still here. To help celebrate APOD's Silver Anniversary, some of APOD's TVAoTaSMD have recorded a birthday greeting and thanks to APOD's readership in today's featured video.  Many have also highlighted a few of their favorite APOD images. In collaboration with NASA through APOD, these and other volunteers help to inform the world, in most major world languages and over most major media platforms, of NASA and humanity's growing knowledge, active exploration, and inspiring visualizations of the amazing astronomical universe in which we live. APOD's founders (still alive!) would also like to offer a sincere thank you -- not only to our TVAoTaSMD -- but to APOD's readership for continued interest, support, and many gracious communications over the years.","year, today, welcome, quadranscentennial, astronomy, picture, source, consistency, apod, help, celebrate, silver, anniversary, tvaotasmd, recorded, birthday, greeting, thanks, readership, featured, video, many, highlighted, favorite, image, collaboration, nasa, volunteer, inform, world, major, language, medium, platform, humanity, growing, knowledge, active, exploration, inspiring, visualization, amazing, astronomical, universe, live, founder, alive, like, offer, sincere, thank, continued, interest, support, gracious, communication"
Magnetic Streamlines of the Milky Way,"What role do magnetic fields play in interstellar physics?  Analyses of observations by ESA's Planck satellite of emission by small magnetically-aligned dust grains reveal previously unknown magnetic field structures in our Milky Way Galaxy -- as shown by the curvy lines in the featured full-sky image.  The dark red shows the plane of the Milky Way, where the concentration of dust is the highest.  The huge arches above the plane are likely remnants of past explosive events from our Galaxy's core, conceptually similar to magnetic loop-like structures seen in our Sun's atmosphere.  The curvy streamlines align with interstellar filaments of neutral hydrogen gas and provide tantalizing evidence that magnetic fields may supplement gravity in not only in shaping the interstellar medium, but in forming stars.  How magnetism affected our Galaxy's evolution will likely remain a topic of research for years to come.","magnetic, streamlines, milky, role, field, play, interstellar, physic, analysis, observation, planck, satellite, emission, small, magnetically-aligned, dust, grain, reveal, unknown, structure, galaxy, shown, curvy, line, featured, full-sky, image, dark, show, plane, concentration, highest, huge, arch, likely, remnant, explosive, event, core, similar, loop-like, seen, atmosphere, filament, neutral, hydrogen, provide, tantalizing, evidence, supplement, gravity, shaping, medium, forming, star, magnetism, affected, evolution, remain, topic, research, year, come"
The Tadpoles of IC 410,"This telescopic close-up shows off the central regions of otherwise faint emission nebula IC 410, captured under backyard suburban skies with narrowband filters. It also features two remarkable inhabitants of the cosmic pond of gas and dust. Below and right of center are the tadpoles of IC 410. Partly obscured by foreground dust, the nebula itself surrounds NGC 1893, a young galactic cluster of stars. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, the intensely hot, bright cluster stars energize the glowing gas. Composed of denser cooler gas and dust, the tadpoles are around 10 light-years long and are likely sites of ongoing star formation. Sculpted by stellar winds and radiation their heads are outlined by bright ridges of ionized gas while their tails trail away from the cluster's central young stars. IC 410 lies some 10,000 light-years away, toward the nebula-rich constellation Auriga.","tadpole, telescopic, close-up, show, central, region, faint, emission, nebula, captured, suburban, narrowband, filter, feature, remarkable, inhabitant, cosmic, pond, center, obscured, foreground, dust, surround, young, galactic, cluster, star, formed, interstellar, cloud, year, bright, energize, glowing, composed, denser, cooler, light-year, likely, site, ongoing, formation, sculpted, stellar, wind, radiation, head, outlined, ridge, ionized, tail, trail, nebula-rich, constellation, auriga"
The Veins of Heaven,"Transfusing sunlight through a darkened sky, this beautiful display of noctilucent clouds was captured earlier this week, reflected in calm waters from Nykobing Mors, Denmark. From the edge of space, about 80 kilometers above Earth's surface, the icy clouds themselves still reflect sunlight, though the Sun is below the horizon as seen from the ground. Usually spotted at high latitudes in summer months the night shining clouds have made an early appearance this year as northern nights grow short. Also known as polar mesopheric clouds they are understood to form as water vapor driven into the cold upper atmosphere condenses on the fine dust particles supplied by disintegrating meteors or volcanic ash.

Northern Summer on Titan,"Today's solstice brings summer to planet Earth's northern hemisphere. But the northern summer solstice arrived for ringed planet Saturn over three years ago on May 24, 2017. Orbiting the gas giant, Saturn's moon Titan experiences the Saturnian seasons that are about 7 Earth-years long. Larger than inner planet Mercury, Titan was captured in this Cassini spacecraft image about two weeks after its northern summer began. The near-infrared view finds bright methane clouds drifting through Titan's dense, hazy atmosphere as seen from a distance of about 507,000 kilometers. Below the clouds, dark hydrocarbon lakes sprawl near its fully illuminated north pole.","northern, summer, today, solstice, brings, planet, earth, hemisphere, arrived, ringed, saturn, year, orbiting, giant, moon, titan, experience, saturnian, season, earth-years, long, larger, inner, mercury, captured, cassini, spacecraft, image, week, began, near-infrared, view, find, bright, methane, cloud, drifting, dense, hazy, seen, distance, kilometer, dark, hydrocarbon, lake, sprawl, illuminated, north, pole"
Moon Occults Venus,"It may look like Earthrise, but it's actually Venus-set. Just after sunrise two days ago, both the Moon and Venus also rose.  But then the Moon overtook Venus. In the featured image sequence centered on the Moon, Venus is shown increasingly angularly close to the Moon. In the famous Earthrise image taken just over 50 years ago, the Earth was captured rising over the edge of the Moon, as seen from the Apollo 8 crew orbiting the Moon. This similar Venus-set image was taken from Earth, of course, specifically Estonia.  Venus shows only a thin crescent because last week it passed nearly in front of the Sun, as seen from Earth.  The Moon shows only a thin crescent because it will soon be passing directly in front of the Sun, as seen from Earth. Today, in fact, two days after this image was taken, the Moon will create a solar eclipse, with a thin swath across the Earth treated to an annular solar eclipse.

Moon Mountains Magnified during Ring of Fire Eclipse,"What are those dark streaks in this composite image of yesterday's solar eclipse? They are reversed shadows of mountains at the edge of the Moon.  The center image, captured from Xiamen, China, has the Moon's center directly in front of the Sun's center. The Moon, though, was too far from the Earth to completely block the entire Sun.  Light that streamed around all of the edges of the Moon is called a  ring of fire. Images at each end of the sequence show sunlight that streamed through lunar valleys.  As the Moon moved further in front of the Sun, left to right, only the higher peaks on the Moon's perimeter could block sunlight.  Therefore, the dark streaks are projected, distorted, reversed, and magnified shadows of mountains at the Moon's edge.  Bright areas are called Baily's Beads. Only a narrow swath across Earth's Eastern Hemisphere was able to see yesterday's full annular solar eclipse. Next June, though, a narrow swath across Earth's Northern Hemisphere will be able to see the next annular solar eclipse.  A total solar eclipse will be visible at the bottom of the world near the end of this year.

The X-Ray Sky from eROSITA,"What if you could see X-rays?  The night sky would seem a strange and unfamiliar place.  X-rays are about 1,000 times more energetic than visible light photons and are produced by violent explosions and high temperature astronomical environments.  Instead of the familiar steady stars, the sky would seem to be filled with exotic stars, active galaxies, and hot supernova remnants. The featured X-ray image captures in unprecedented detail the entire sky in X-rays as seen by the eROSITA telescope onboard  Spektr-RG satellite, orbiting around the L2 point of the Sun-Earth system, launched last year. The image shows the plane of our Milky Way galaxy across the center, a diffuse and pervasive X-ray background, the hot interstellar bubble known as the North Polar Spur, sizzling supernova remnants such as Vela, the Cygnus Loop and Cas A, energetic binary stars including Cyg X-1 and Cyg X-2, the  LMC galaxy, and the Coma, Virgo, and Fornax clusters of galaxies.  This first sky scan by eROSITA located over one million X-ray sources, some of which are not understood and will surely be topics for future research.","x-ray, erosita, night, seem, strange, unfamiliar, place, time, energetic, visible, light, photon, produced, violent, explosion, high, temperature, astronomical, environment, familiar, steady, star, filled, exotic, active, galaxy, supernova, remnant, featured, image, capture, unprecedented, detail, entire, seen, telescope, spektr-rg, satellite, orbiting, point, sun-earth, system, launched, last, year, show, plane, milky, center, diffuse, pervasive, background, interstellar, bubble, known, north, polar, spur, sizzling, vela, cygnus, loop, binary, including, coma, virgo, fornax, cluster, scan, located, source, understood, topic, future, research"
Inverted City Beneath Clouds,"How could that city be upside-down? The city, Chicago, was actually perfectly right-side up. The long shadows it projected onto nearby Lake Michigan near sunset, however, when seen in reflection, made the buildings appear inverted. This fascinating, puzzling, yet beautiful image was captured by a photographer in 2014 on an airplane on approach to Chicago's O'Hare International Airport.  The Sun can be seen both above and below the cloud deck, with the latter reflected in the calm lake.  As a bonus, if you look really closely -- and this is quite a challenge -- you can find another airplane in the image, likely also on approach to the same airport.","inverted, city, beneath, cloud, upside-down, chicago, right-side, long, shadow, projected, nearby, lake, michigan, sunset, seen, reflection, made, building, appear, fascinating, puzzling, beautiful, image, captured, airplane, approach, o'hare, international, airport, deck, latter, reflected, calm, bonus, look, challenge, find"
"Eclipse Street, Hong Kong","On June 21 an annular solar eclipse came soon after the solstice and our fair planet's northernmost sunset for 2020. At maximum eclipse, the New Moon in silhouette created a ring of fire visible along a narrow path at most 85 kilometers wide. The annular eclipse path began in central Africa, crossed south Asia and China, and ended over the Pacific Ocean. But a partial eclipse of the Sun was visible over a much broader region. In Hong Kong, this busy section of Jordan Street looks to the northwest, well-aligned with the track of the near solstice afternoon Sun. The street level view was composited with an eclipse sequence made with a safe solar filter on the camera. For that location the eclipse was partial. The Moon covered about 90 percent of the Sun's diameter at maximum, seen near the middle of the eclipse sequence.

Eclipse under the Bamboo,"Want to watch a solar eclipse safely? Try looking down instead of up, though you might discover you have a plethora of images to choose from. For example, during the June 21st solar eclipse this confusing display appeared under a shady bamboo grove in Pune, India. Small gaps between close knit leaves on the tall plants effectively created a network of randomly placed pinholes. Each one projected a separate image of the eclipsed Sun. The snapshot was taken close to the time of maximum eclipse in Pune when the Moon covered about 60 percent of the Sun's diameter. But an annular eclipse, the Moon in silhouette completely surrounded by a bright solar disk at maximum, could be seen along a narrow path where the Moon's dark shadow crossed central Africa, south Asia, and China.

Europa and Jupiter from Voyager 1,"What are those spots on Jupiter? Largest and furthest, just right of center, is the Great Red Spot -- a huge storm system that has been raging on Jupiter possibly since Giovanni Cassini's likely notation of it 355 years ago.  It is not yet known why this Great Spot is red. The spot toward the lower left is one of Jupiter's largest moons: Europa. Images from Voyager in 1979 bolster the modern hypothesis that Europa has an underground ocean and is therefore a good place to look for extraterrestrial life. But what about the dark spot on the upper right? That is a shadow of another of Jupiter's large moons: Io. Voyager 1 discovered Io to be so volcanic that no impact craters could be found.  Sixteen frames from Voyager 1's flyby of Jupiter in 1979 were recently reprocessed and merged to create the featured image.  About 43 years ago, Voyager 1 launched from Earth and started one of the greatest explorations of the Solar System ever.

Dark Sky Reflections,"When the lake calmed down, many wonders of the land and sky appeared twice. Perhaps the most dramatic from the dark sky was the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, visible as a diagonal band. Toward the right were both the Small (SMC) and Large (LMC) Magellanic Clouds, satellite galaxies of our Milky Way. Faint multicolored bands of airglow fanned across the night. Numerous bright stars were visible including Antares, while the bright planet Jupiter appears just above the image center. The featured image is a composite of exposures all taken from the same camera and from the same location within 30 minutes in mid-May from the shore of Lake Bonney Riverland in South Australia. Dead trees that extend from the lake were captured not only in silhouette, but reflection, while lights from the small town of Barmera were visible across the lake.

Bright Planetary Nebula NGC 7027 from Hubble,"What created this unusual planetary nebula? NGC 7027 is one of the smallest, brightest, and most unusually shaped planetary nebulas known. Given its expansion rate, NGC 7027 first started expanding, as visible from Earth, about 600 years ago.  For much of its history, the planetary nebula has been expelling shells, as seen in blue in the featured image.  In modern times, though, for reasons unknown, it began ejecting gas and dust (seen in red) in specific directions that created a new pattern that seems to have four corners. These shells and patterns have been mapped in impressive detail by recent images from the Wide Field Camera 3 onboard the Hubble Space Telescope.  What lies at the nebula's center is unknown, with one hypothesis holding it to be a close binary star system where one star sheds gas onto an erratic disk orbiting the other star. NGC 7027, about 3,000 light years away, was first discovered in 1878 and can be seen with a standard backyard telescope toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).","bright, planetary, nebula, hubble, created, unusual, smallest, brightest, shaped, known, given, expansion, rate, started, expanding, visible, earth, year, much, history, expelling, shell, seen, blue, featured, image, modern, time, reason, unknown, began, ejecting, dust, specific, direction, pattern, seems, corner, mapped, impressive, detail, recent, wide, field, camera, onboard, space, telescope, center, hypothesis, holding, close, binary, star, system, shed, erratic, disk, orbiting, light, discovered, standard, constellation, swan, cygnus"
Our Rotating Earth,"Has your world ever turned upside-down?  It would happen every day if you stay fixed to the stars.  Most time-lapse videos of the night sky show the stars and sky moving above a steady Earth.  Here, however, the camera has been forced to rotate so that the stars remain fixed, and the Earth rotates around them.  The movie, with each hour is compressed to a second, dramatically demonstrates the daily rotation of the Earth, called diurnal motion. The video begins by showing an open field in Namibia, Africa, on a clear day, last year.  Shadows shift as the Earth turns, the shadow of the Earth rises into the sky, the Belt of Venus momentarily appears, and then day turns into night. The majestic band of our Milky Way Galaxy stretches across the night sky, while sunlight-reflecting, Earth-orbiting satellites zoom by.  In the night sky, you can even spot the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.  The video shows a sky visible from Earth's Southern Hemisphere, but a similar video could be made for every middle latitude on our blue planet.

"The Galaxy, the Planet, and the Apple Tree","The Old Astronomer's Milky Way arcs through this peaceful northern sky. Against faint, diffuse starlight you can follow dark rifts of interstellar dust clouds stretching from the galaxy's core. They lead toward bright star Antares at the right, almost due south above the horizon. The brightest beacon in the twilight is Jupiter, though. From the camera's perspective it seems to hang from the limb of a tree framing the foreground, an apple tree of course. The serene maritime nightscape was recorded in tracked and untracked exposures on June 16 from Dover, Nova Scotia, planet Earth.","galaxy, planet, apple, tree, astronomer, milky, peaceful, northern, faint, diffuse, starlight, follow, dark, rift, interstellar, dust, cloud, stretching, core, lead, bright, star, antares, south, horizon, brightest, beacon, twilight, jupiter, camera, perspective, seems, hang, limb, framing, foreground, course, serene, maritime, nightscape, recorded, tracked, untracked, exposure, june, dover, nova, scotia, earth"
Lynds Dark Nebula 1251,"Stars are forming in Lynds Dark Nebula (LDN) 1251. About 1,000 light-years away and drifting above the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the dusty molecular cloud is part of a complex of dark nebulae mapped toward the Cepheus flare region. Across the spectrum, astronomical explorations of the obscuring interstellar clouds reveal energetic shocks and outflows associated with newborn stars, including the telltale reddish glow from scattered Herbig-Haro objects seen in this sharp image. Distant background galaxies also lurk on the scene, buried behind the dusty expanse. This alluring view imaged with a backyard telescope and broadband filters spans about two full moons on the sky, or 17 light-years at the estimated distance of LDN 1251.","lynds, dark, nebula, star, forming, light-year, drifting, plane, milky, galaxy, dusty, molecular, cloud, part, complex, mapped, cepheus, flare, region, spectrum, astronomical, exploration, obscuring, interstellar, reveal, energetic, shock, outflow, associated, newborn, including, telltale, reddish, glow, scattered, herbig-haro, object, seen, sharp, image, distant, background, lurk, scene, buried, expanse, alluring, view, imaged, telescope, broadband, filter, span, full, moon, estimated, distance"
Meeting in the Mesosphere,"A sensitive video camera on a summit of the Vosges mountains in France captured these surprising fireworks above a distant horizon on June 26. Generated over intense thunderstorms, this one about 260 kilometers away, the brief and mysterious flashes have come to be known as red sprites. The transient luminous events are caused by electrical breakdown at altitudes of 50 to 100 kilometers. That puts them in the mesophere, the coldest layer of planet Earth's atmosphere. The glow beneath the sprites is from more familiar lighting though, below the storm clouds. But on the right, the video frames have captured another summertime apparition from the mesophere. The silvery veins of light are polar mesospheric clouds. Also known as noctilucent or night shining clouds, the icy clouds still reflect the sunlight when the Sun is below the horizon.","meeting, sensitive, video, camera, summit, vosges, mountain, captured, surprising, firework, distant, horizon, june, generated, intense, thunderstorm, kilometer, brief, mysterious, flash, come, known, sprite, transient, luminous, event, caused, electrical, breakdown, altitude, coldest, layer, planet, earth, atmosphere, glow, beneath, familiar, lighting, storm, cloud, frame, summertime, apparition, silvery, vein, light, polar, mesospheric, noctilucent, night, shining, reflect, sunlight"
Saturn's Northern Hexagon,"Why would clouds form a hexagon on Saturn? Nobody is sure.   Originally discovered during the Voyager flybys of Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen anything like it anywhere else in the Solar System.  Acquiring its first sunlit views of far northern Saturn in late 2012, the Cassini spacecraft's wide-angle camera recorded this stunning, false-color image of the ringed planet's north pole. The composite of near-infrared image data results in red hues for low clouds and green for high ones, giving the Saturnian cloudscape a vivid appearance. This and similar images show the stability of the hexagon even 20+ years after Voyager.  Movies of Saturn's North Pole show the cloud structure maintaining its hexagonal structure while rotating.  Unlike individual clouds appearing like a hexagon on Earth, the Saturn cloud pattern appears to have six well defined sides of nearly equal length. Four Earths could fit inside the hexagon. Beyond the cloud tops at the upper right, arcs of the planet's eye-catching rings appear bright blue.","saturn, northern, hexagon, cloud, form, nobody, sure, discovered, voyager, flybys, seen, anything, solar, system, acquiring, first, sunlit, view, late, cassini, spacecraft, wide-angle, camera, recorded, stunning, false-color, image, ringed, planet, north, pole, composite, near-infrared, data, result, green, high, giving, saturnian, cloudscape, vivid, appearance, similar, show, stability, year, movie, structure, maintaining, hexagonal, rotating, individual, appearing, earth, pattern, appears, defined, side, equal, length, upper, right, eye-catching, ring, appear, bright, blue"

Comet NEOWISE over Lebanon,"A comet has suddenly become visible to the unaided eye.  Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was discovered in late March and brightened as it reached its closest approach to the Sun, inside the orbit of Mercury, late last week. The interplanetary iceberg survived solar heating, so far, and is now becoming closer to the Earth as it starts its long trek back to the outer Solar System. As Comet NEOWISE became one of the few naked-eye comets of the 21st Century, word spread quickly, and the comet has already been photographed behind many famous sites and cities around the globe. Featured, Comet NEOWISE was captured over Lebanon two days ago just before sunrise. The future brightness of Comet NEOWISE remains somewhat uncertain but the comet will likely continue to be findable not only in the early morning sky, but also next week in the early evening sky.

Mercury's Sodium Tail,"What is that fuzzy streak extending from Mercury? Long exposures of our Solar System's innermost planet may reveal something unexpected: a tail. Mercury's thin atmosphere contains small amounts of sodium that glow when excited by light from the Sun. Sunlight also liberates these molecules from Mercury's surface and pushes them away. The yellow glow from sodium, in particular, is relatively bright.  Pictured, Mercury and its sodium tail are visible in a deep image taken in late May from Italy through a filter that primarily transmits yellow light emitted by sodium. First predicted in the 1980s, Mercury's tail was first discovered in 2001. Many tail details were revealed in multiple observations by NASA's robotic MESSENGER spacecraft that orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015.  Tails are usually associated with comets.  The tails of Comet NEOWISE are currently visible with the unaided eye in the morning sky.

Noctilucent Clouds and Comet NEOWISE,"These silvery blue waves washing over a tree-lined horizon in the eastern French Alps are noctilucent clouds. From high in planet Earth's mesosphere, they reflect sunlight in this predawn skyscape taken on July 8. This summer, the night-shining clouds are not new to the northern high-latitudes. Comet NEOWISE is though. Also known as C/2020 F3, the comet was discovered in March by the Earth-orbiting Near Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer (NEOWISE) satellite.

Comet NEOWISE from the ISS,"Rounding the Sun on July 3rd and currently headed for the outer Solar System, Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) has been growing brighter in the predawn skies of planet Earth. From low Earth orbit it also rises before the Sun, captured above the approaching glow along the eastern horizon in this snapshot from the International Space Station on July 5. Venus, now Earth's morning star is the brilliant celestial beacon on the right in the field of view. Above Venus you can spot the sister stars of the more compact Pleiades cluster.

The Tails of Comet NEOWISE,"Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) is now sweeping through northern skies. Its developing tails stretch some six degrees across this telescopic field of view, recorded from Brno, Czech Republic before daybreak on July 10. Pushed out by the pressure of sunlight itself, the comet's broad, yellowish dust tail is easiest to see. But the image also captures a fainter, more bluish tail too, separate from the reflective comet dust. The fainter tail is an ion tail, formed as ions from the cometary coma are dragged outward by magnetic fields in the solar wind and fluoresce in the sunlight. In this sharp portrait of our new visitor from the outer Solar System, the tails of comet NEOWISE are reminiscent of the even brighter tails of Hale Bopp, the Great Comet of 1997.

Comet CG Creates Its Dust Tail,"Where do comet tails come from?  There are no obvious places on the nuclei of comets from which the jets that create comet tails emanate.  One of the best images of emerging jets is shown in the featured picture, taken in 2015 by ESA's robotic Rosetta spacecraft that orbited Comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko (Comet CG) from 2014 to 2016.  The picture shows plumes of gas and dust escaping numerous places from Comet CG's nucleus as it neared the Sun and heated up.  The comet has two prominent lobes, the larger one spanning about 4 kilometers, and a smaller 2.5-kilometer lobe connected by a narrow neck. Analyses indicate that evaporation must be taking place well inside the comet's surface to create the jets of dust and ice that we see emitted through the surface.  Comet CG (also known as Comet 67P) loses in jets about a meter of radius during each of its 6.44-year orbits around the Sun, a rate at which will completely destroy the comet in only thousands of years. In 2016, Rosetta's mission ended with a controlled impact onto Comet CG's surface.

Comet NEOWISE Rising over the Adriatic Sea,"This sight was worth getting out of bed early.  Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) has been rising before dawn during the past week to the delight of northern sky enthusiasts awake that early. Up before sunrise, the featured photographer was able to capture in dramatic fashion one of the few comets visible to the unaided eye this century, an inner-Solar System intruder that might become known as the Great Comet of 2020.  The resulting video details Comet NEOWISE from Italy rising over the Adriatic Sea. The time-lapse video combines over 240 images taken over 30 minutes.  The comet is seen rising through a foreground of bright and undulating noctilucent clouds, and before a background of distant stars.  Comet NEOWISE has remained unexpectedly bright, so far, with its ion and dust tails found to emanate from a nucleus spanning about five kilometers across.  Fortunately, starting tonight, northern observers with a clear and dark northwestern horizon should be able to see the sun-reflecting interplanetary snowball just after sunset.

Comet NEOWISE over Stonehenge,"Have you ever seen a comet? Tonight -- and likely the next few nights -- should be a good chance. Go outside just at sunset and look to your northwest.  The lower your horizon, the better.  Binoculars may help, but if your sky is cloudless and dark, all you should need is your unaided eyes and patience. As the Sun sets, the sky will darken, and there will be an unusual faint streak pointing diagonally near the horizon. That is Comet NEOWISE. It is a 5-kilometer-wide evaporating dirty iceberg visiting from -- and returning to -- the outer Solar System. As the Earth turns, the comet will soon set, so you might want to take a picture. In the featured image, Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) was captured two mornings ago rising over Stonehenge in the UK.  Discovered with the NASA satellite NEOWISE toward the end of March, Comet NEOWISE has surprised many by surviving its closest approach to the Sun, brightening dramatically, and developing impressive (blue) ion and (white) dust tails.

Comet NEOWISE over the Swiss Alps,"Comet NEOWISE has been wowing photographers around much of the world during dawn and dusk, at the margins of day and night.  For the most northern residents of planet Earth, however, the comet circles the North Star and never sets. The night part of this circular arc is apparent in the featured composite of images assembled from a webcam located at a ski resort in the Swiss Alps.  Images were selected at 30-minute intervals throughout the night from July 12th -13th. Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) will continue to become more accessible to northern hemisphere observers as its motion places it higher in the sky each evening after sunset over the next few weeks, as it begins its outbound journey.  As with all comets, departure from the inner Solar System comes with inevitable fading.  Binoculars are the best way to find and observe the comet visually.

The Long Tails of Comet NEOWISE,"This Comet NEOWISE (C/2020 F3) now sweeps through our fair planet's northern skies. Its long tails stretch across this deep skyview from Suchy Vrch, Czech Republic. Recorded on the night of July 13/14, the composite of untracked foreground and tracked and filtered sky exposures teases out details in the comet's tail not visible to the unaided eye. Faint structures extend to the top of the frame, over 20 degrees from the comet's bright coma. Pushed out by the pressure of sunlight itself, the broad curve of the comet's yellowish dust tail is easy to see by eye. But the fainter, more bluish tail is separate from the reflective comet dust. The fainter tail is an ion tail, formed as ions from the cometary coma are dragged outward by magnetic fields in the solar wind and fluoresce in the sunlight. Outbound NEOWISE is climbing higher in northern evening skies, coming closest to Earth on July 23rd.

Finding NEOWISE,"If you can see the stars of the Big Dipper, you can find comet NEOWISE in your evening sky tonight. After sunset look for the naked-eye comet below the bowl of the famous celestial kitchen utensil of the north and above your northwestern horizon. You're looking for a fuzzy 'star' with a tail, though probably not so long a tail as in this clear sky snapshot taken from Los Padres National Forest in California on the evening of July 16. Recent photographs of C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) often show this comet's broad dust tail and fainter but separate ion tail extending farther than the eye can follow.

Rotating Moon from LRO,"No one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this. That's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us only one side.  Given modern digital technology, however, combined with many detailed images returned by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a high resolution virtual Moon rotation movie has been composed. The featured time-lapse video starts with the standard Earth view of the Moon. Quickly, though, Mare Orientale, a large crater with a dark center that is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator.  From an entire lunar month condensed into 24 seconds, the video clearly shows that the Earth side of the Moon contains an abundance of dark lunar maria, while the lunar far side is dominated by bright lunar highlands. Currently, over 19 new missions to the Moon are under active development from eight different countries, most of which have expected launch dates in the next three years.

Comet NEOWISE and Nebulae,"Would you brave wild animals to photograph this sky? One astrophotographer did -- and we all get to reap the rewards.  First, thousands of stars were visible with many of the brightest impressively blue. Next, several red-glowing nebulae were discernible, including the California Nebula on the far right, and, above it, the Heart and Soul nebulae. But the real reason to brave the local wildlife was Comet NEOWISE, visible on the left.  In the featured long-duration composite taken last week, Comet NEOWISE's blue-glowing ion tail points straight up, away from the rising Sun, while the Sun-reflecting dust tail trails off toward the right.  The picture combines three exposures taken consecutively over 10 minutes from the same location near Miedzygórze, Poland.  A moonlit dirt road shows the path ahead, while the Śnieznik Mountains is visible on the horizon. Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) passes its closest to the Earth next week, after which the 5-km wide, evaporating, icy dirtball will fade as it glides back to the outer Solar System.

Iron in the Butterfly Nebula,"Can stars, like caterpillars, transform themselves into butterflies? No, but in the case of the Butterfly Nebula -- it sure looks like it. Though its wingspan covers over 3 light-years and its estimated surface temperature exceeds 200,000 degrees, C, the dying central star of NGC 6302, the featured planetary nebula, has become exceptionally hot, shining brightly in visible and ultraviolet light but hidden from direct view by a dense torus of dust. This sharp close-up was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope and is reprocessed here to show off the remarkable details of the complex planetary nebula, highlighting in particular light emitted by iron, shown in red.  NGC 6302 lies about 4,000 light-years away in the arachnologically correct constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius). Planetary nebulas evolve from outer atmospheres of stars like our Sun, but usually fade in about 20,000 years.

The Structured Tails of Comet NEOWISE,"What is creating the structure in Comet NEOWISE's tails? Of the two tails evident, the blue ion tail on the left points directly away from the Sun and is pushed out by the flowing and charged solar wind. Structure in the ion tail comes from different rates of expelled blue-glowing ions from the comet's nucleus, as well as the always complex and continually changing structure of our Sun's wind. Most unusual for Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE), though, is the wavy structure of its dust tail. This dust tail is pushed out by sunlight, but curves as heavier dust particles are better able to resist this light pressure and continue along a solar orbit.  Comet NEOWISE's impressive dust-tail striations are not fully understood, as yet, but likely related to rotating streams of sun-reflecting grit liberated by ice melting on its 5-kilometer wide nucleus.  The featured 40-image conglomerate, digitally enhanced, was captured three days ago through the dark skies of the Gobi Desert in Inner Mongolia, China. Comet NEOWISE will make it closest pass to the Earth tomorrow as it moves out from the Sun. The comet, already fading but still visible to the unaided eye, should fade more rapidly as it recedes from the Earth.

Fairytale NEOWISE,"Comet dust falls through a twilight sky in this dream-like scene, but it's not part of a fairytale movie. Still, Castle Neuschwanstein, nestled in the Bavarian Alps, did inspire Disneyland's Sleeping Beauty Castle. Captured on July 20, the bright streak above the castle towers is likely a Perseid meteor. Though it peaks near mid-August, the annual summer meteor shower is active now. The meteor trail over the fairytale castle can be traced back to the shower's radiant in the heroic constellation Perseus off the top right of the frame. Perseid meteors are produced by dust from periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle. With its own broad dust tail now sweeping through northern skies the celestial apparition above the distant horizon is planet Earth's current darling, Comet NEOWISE.

MAGIC NEOWISE,"The multi-mirror, 17 meter-diameter MAGIC telescopes reflect this starry night sky from the Roque de los Muchachos European Northern Observatory on the Canary Island of La Palma. MAGIC stands for Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov and the telescopes can see the brief flashes of optical light produced in particle air showers as high-energy gamma rays impact the Earth's upper atmosphere. On July 20, two of the three telescopes in view were looking for gamma rays from the center of our Milky Way galaxy. In reflection they show the bright stars of Sagittarius and Scorpius near the galactic center to the southeast. Beyond the segmented-mirror arrays, above the northwest horizon and below the Big Dipper is Comet NEOWISE. NEOWISE stands for Near Earth Object Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer. That's the Earth-orbiting satellite used to discover the comet designated C/2020 F3, but you knew that.

Tianwen-1 Mission to Mars,"On July 23, this Long March 5 heavy-lift rocket rose into a blue morning sky from China's Hainan Island Wenchang Satellite Launch Center. The rocket carried an orbiter, lander, and rover to ask Heavenly Questions on the ambitious Tianwen-1 mission to Mars. In fact Tianwen-1 was the second of three missions scheduled for a July departure to the Red Planet. The United Arab Emirates launched its Amal (Hope) Mars probe on July 19.  NASA's launch of its Mars Perseverance Rover from Cape Canaveral Air Force Station, USA is scheduled for July 30. That is the last planned Mars launch for 2020 though. The minimum-energy launch window for an expedition to Mars is coming to a close in 2020 and will reopen in 2022.

A Flight through the Hubble Ultra Deep Field,"What would it look like to fly through the distant universe? To find out, a team of astronomers estimated the relative distances to over 5,000 galaxies in one of the most distant fields of galaxies ever imaged: the Hubble Ultra Deep Field (HUDF). Because it takes light a long time to cross the universe, most galaxies visible in the featured video are seen when the universe was only a fraction of its current age, were still forming, and have unusual shapes when compared to modern galaxies. No mature looking spiral galaxies such as our Milky Way or the Andromeda galaxy yet exist. Toward the end of the video the virtual observer flies past the farthest galaxies in the HUDF field, recorded to have a redshift past 8. This early class of low luminosity galaxies likely contained energetic stars emitting light that transformed much of the remaining normal matter in the universe from a cold gas to a hot ionized plasma.

Comet and Lightning Beyond Bighorn Mountains,"Normally, Steamboat Point looks cool -- but not this cool. Every day, the iconic peak of the Bighorn Mountains is an interesting sight, in particular from US Highway 14 in Wyoming. On some rare days, the rocky vertical ridges look even more incredible when seen in front of a distant lightning storm. Earlier this month, though, something even more unusual happened -- the naked-eye Comet NEOWISE rose above it in the middle of the night. Just as a distant lightning storm was occurring in the background.  Recognizing a rare opportunity, a determined astrophotographer spent a sleepless night capturing  over 1400 images of this unusual triple conjunction.  The featured image is among the best of them, with the foreground lit by the Moon off to the right.  Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) is now headed back to the outer Solar System, destined to return only in about 6700 years.

NGC 6188: The Dragons of Ara,"Dark shapes with bright edges winging their way through dusty NGC 6188 are tens of light-years long. The emission nebula is found near the edge of an otherwise dark and large molecular cloud in the southern constellation Ara, about 4,000 light-years away. Born in that region only a few million years ago, the massive young stars of the embedded Ara OB1 association sculpt the fantastic shapes and power the nebular glow with stellar winds and intense ultraviolet radiation. The recent star formation itself was likely triggered by winds and supernova explosions, from previous generations of massive stars, that swept up and compressed the molecular gas. The featured image accumulated over 10 hours through a backyard telescope in Córdoba, Argentina and was false-colored using the Hubble palette highlighting emission from sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms in red, green, and blue hues. The field of view spans about four full Moons, corresponding to about 150 light years at the estimated distance of NGC 6188.","dragon, dark, shape, bright, edge, winging, dusty, light-year, long, emission, nebula, found, large, molecular, cloud, southern, constellation, born, region, year, massive, young, star, embedded, association, sculpt, fantastic, power, nebular, glow, stellar, wind, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, recent, formation, triggered, supernova, explosion, previous, generation, swept, compressed, featured, image, accumulated, hour, backyard, telescope, córdoba, false-colored, using, hubble, palette, highlighting, sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, atom, green, blue, field, view, span, full, moon, corresponding, light, estimated, distance"
The Giants of Summer,"As Comet NEOWISE sweeps through northern summer skies, Jupiter and Saturn are shining brightly, near opposition. With Jupiter opposite the Sun on July 14 and Saturn on July 21, the giant planets are still near their closest to planet Earth in 2020. Sharing the constellation Sagittarius they are up all night, and offer their best and brightest views at the telescope. Both captured on July 22 from a balcony in Paris these two sharp telescopic images don't disappoint, showing off what the giant planets are famous for, Saturn's bright rings and Jupiter's Great Red Spot. These giants of the Solar System are worth following during 2020. On December 21, skygazers can watch the once-in-20-year great conjunction of Jupiter and Saturn.

The Red Planet Mars,"Mars looks pretty sharp in this backyard telescope image captured on July 23 from Hoegaarden, Belgium, planet Earth. The Red Planet's bright south polar cap is bathed in sunlight at the top of the inverted view, while the dark feature known as Syrtis Major extends toward the right (eastern) edge. Rising around midnight for now, the Red Planet is months away from its own opposition in early October. Telescopic views will improve even more as Earth, in its faster orbit, catches up to Mars, the ruddy disk growing larger and brighter still. The martian Jezero Crater is within the Syrtis Major region. That's the landing site for NASA's 2020 Mars Rover Perseverance, scheduled for launch today.

The Elephant's Trunk Nebula in Cepheus,"Like an illustration in a galactic Just So Story, the Elephant's Trunk Nebula winds through the emission nebula and young star cluster complex IC 1396, in the high and far off constellation of Cepheus. Also known as vdB 142, the cosmic elephant's trunk is over 20 light-years long. This detailed close-up view was recorded through narrow band filters that transmit the light from ionized hydrogen and oxygen atoms in the region.  The resulting composite highlights the bright swept-back ridges that outline pockets of cool interstellar dust and gas. Such embedded, dark, tendril-shaped clouds contain the raw material for star formation and hide protostars within. Nearly 3,000 light-years distant, the relatively faint IC 1396 complex covers a large region on the sky, spanning over 5 degrees.

"Two Worlds, One Sun","How different does sunset appear from Mars than from Earth? For comparison, two images of our common star were taken at sunset, one from Earth and one from Mars. These images were scaled to have same angular width and featured here side-by-side. A quick inspection will reveal that the Sun appears slightly smaller from Mars than from Earth. This makes sense since Mars is 50% further from the Sun than Earth. More striking, perhaps, is that the Martian sunset is noticeably bluer near the Sun than the typically orange colors near the setting Sun from Earth. The reason for the blue hues from Mars is not fully understood, but thought to be related to forward scattering properties of Martian dust. The terrestrial sunset was taken in 2012 March from Marseille, France, while the Martian sunset was captured in 2015 by NASA's robotic Curiosity rover from Gale crater on Mars. Last week a new rover and a helicopter -- onboard Mars 2020 -- launched for Mars.","world, different, sunset, appear, earth, comparison, image, common, star, taken, scaled, angular, width, featured, side-by-side, quick, inspection, reveal, appears, smaller, make, sense, striking, martian, bluer, orange, color, setting, reason, blue, understood, thought, related, scattering, property, dust, terrestrial, march, france, captured, nasa, robotic, curiosity, rover, gale, crater, last, week, helicopter, launched"
Comet NEOWISE over Vikos Gorge,"Did the Earth part to show us this comet?  Of course not, even if this image makes it seem that way. Pictured far in the background is Comet NEOWISE as it appeared about two weeks ago over northern Greece. Above the comet are many stars including the bright stars of the Big Dipper (also the Sorcerer, in Aztec mythology), an asterism that many people around the world used to find the naked-eye comet as it hovered in the northern sky over the past month.  In the foreground is Vikos Gorge, the deepest gorge on Earth, relative to its width. The gorge was slowly created by erosion from the Voidomatis River over the past few million years.  Capturing this image took a lot of planning, waiting, luck, braving high winds, and avoiding local wolves.  Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) continues to fade and is now best visible through binoculars as it coasts back to the outer Solar System.

NGC 2442: Galaxy in Volans,"Distorted galaxy NGC 2442 can be found in the southern constellation of the flying fish, (Piscis) Volans. Located about 50 million light-years away, the galaxy's two spiral arms extending from a pronounced central bar have a hook-like appearance in wide-field images. But this mosaicked close-up, constructed from Hubble Space Telescope and European Southern Observatory data, follows the galaxy's structure in amazing detail. Obscuring dust lanes, young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions surround a core of yellowish light from an older population of stars.

Picture Rocks Sun Dagger,"Ancient sun daggers will not hurt you, but they may tell you the time.  A sun dagger is a dagger-shaped gap in a shadow created by sunlight streaming through a crevice in a nearby rock. Starting over a thousand year ago, native people of the American southwest carved spiral petroglyphs into rocks that became illuminated by sun daggers in different ways as the Sun shifts in the sky. A type of sundial, where the end of the sundagger points in the spiral at high noon (for example) indicates a time of year, possibly illuminating a solstice or equinox.  Sun daggers are thought to have been used by Sun Priests during lone vigils with prayers and offerings.  Of the few known, the featured video discusses the historic Picture Rocks Sun Dagger near Tucson, Arizona, USA, likely created by a Hohokam Sun Priest around 1000 AD. ","picture, rock, dagger, ancient, hurt, tell, time, dagger-shaped, shadow, created, sunlight, streaming, crevice, starting, year, native, people, american, southwest, carved, spiral, petroglyph, became, illuminated, different, shift, type, sundial, sundagger, point, high, noon, example, indicates, illuminating, solstice, equinox, thought, used, priest, lone, vigil, prayer, offering, known, featured, video, discusses, historic, tucson, arizona, hohokam"
Messier 20 and 21,"The beautiful Trifid Nebula, also known as Messier 20, is easy to find with a small telescope in the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. About 5,000 light-years away, the colorful study in cosmic contrasts shares this well-composed, nearly 1 degree wide field with open star cluster Messier 21 (right). Trisected by dust lanes the Trifid itself is about 40 light-years across and a mere 300,000 years old. That makes it one of the youngest star forming regions in our sky, with newborn and embryonic stars embedded in its natal dust and gas clouds. Estimates of the distance to open star cluster M21 are similar to M20's, but though they share this gorgeous telescopic skyscape there is no apparent connection between the two. In fact, M21's stars are much older, about 8 million years old.","beautiful, trifid, nebula, known, easy, find, small, telescope, rich, constellation, sagittarius, light-year, colorful, study, cosmic, contrast, share, well-composed, degree, wide, field, open, star, cluster, messier, trisected, lane, year, make, youngest, forming, region, newborn, embryonic, embedded, natal, dust, cloud, estimate, distance, similar, gorgeous, telescopic, skyscape, apparent, connection, fact, much, older"
The Pipe Nebula,"st of Antares, dark markings sprawl through crowded star fields toward the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard, the obscuring interstellar dust clouds include B59, B72, B77 and B78, seen in against the starry background. Here, their combined shape suggests a pipe stem and bowl, and so the dark nebula's popular name is the Pipe Nebula. The deep and expansive view covers a full 10 by 10 degree field in the pronounceable constellation Ophiuchus. The Pipe Nebula is part of the Ophiuchus dark cloud complex located at a distance of about 450 light-years.

Crescent Saturn,"From Earth, Saturn never shows a crescent phase. But when viewed from a spacecraft the majestic giant planet can show just a sunlit slice. This image of crescent Saturn in natural color was taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft in 2007. It captures Saturn's rings from the side of the ring plane opposite the Sun -- the unilluminated side -- another vista not visible from Earth. Visible are subtle colors of cloud bands, the complex shadows of the rings on the planet, and the shadow of the planet on the rings. The moons Mimas, at 2 o'clock, and Janus 4 o'clock, can be seen as specks of light, but the real challenge is to find Pandora (8 o'clock).  From Earth, Saturn's disk is nearly full now and opposite the Sun. Along with bright fellow giant planet Jupiter it rises in the early evening.","crescent, saturn, earth, show, phase, viewed, spacecraft, majestic, giant, planet, sunlit, slice, image, natural, color, taken, robotic, cassini, capture, ring, side, plane, opposite, unilluminated, vista, visible, subtle, cloud, band, complex, shadow, moon, mimas, o'clock, janus, seen, speck, light, real, challenge, find, pandora, disk, full, bright, fellow, jupiter, rise, evening"
The Origin of Elements,"The hydrogen in your body, present in every molecule of water, came from the Big Bang.  There are no other appreciable sources of hydrogen in the universe.  The carbon in your body was made by nuclear fusion in the interior of stars, as was the oxygen.  Much of the iron in your body was made during supernovas of stars that occurred long ago and far away.  The gold in your jewelry was likely made from neutron stars during collisions that may have been visible as short-duration gamma-ray bursts or gravitational wave events. Elements like phosphorus and copper are present in our bodies in only small amounts but are essential to the functioning of all known life.  The featured periodic table is color coded to indicate humanity's best guess as to the nuclear origin of all known elements.

Perseids from Perseus,"Where are all these meteors coming from?  In terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the constellation of Perseus.  That is why the meteor shower that peaks tomorrow night is known as the Perseids -- the meteors all appear to came from a radiant toward Perseus. In terms of parent body, though, the sand-sized debris that makes up the Perseids meteors come from Comet Swift-Tuttle. The comet follows a well-defined orbit around our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches Earth is superposed in front of the Perseus. Therefore, when Earth crosses this orbit, the radiant point of falling debris appears in Perseus. Featured here, a composite image taken over eight nights and containing over 400 meteors from 2018 August's Perseids meteor shower shows many bright meteors that streaked over Kolonica Observatory in Slovakia.

Churning Clouds on Jupiter,"Where is Jupiter's ammonia? Gaseous ammonia was expected to be seen in Jupiter's upper atmosphere by the orbiting Juno spacecraft -- but in many clouds is almost absent. Recent Juno data, however, gives some clues: some high-level clouds appear to be home to an unexpected type of electrical discharge dubbed shallow lightning. Great charge separations are needed for lightning, which might be created by colliding mushballs lifted by rising updrafts of gas.  Ammonia and water stick to these mushballs which rise until they get too heavy -- after which they fall deep into Jupiter's atmosphere and melt.  By this process, ammonia found missing from Jupiter's upper atmosphere reappears below.  Pictured by Juno, churning clouds on Jupiter show not only mesmerizing complexity but some high-level, light-colored pop-up clouds. Understanding atmospheric dynamics on Jupiter gives valuable perspective to similar atmospheric and lightning phenomena that occur on our home Earth.

The Shifting Tails of Comet NEOWISE,"Keep your eye on the ion tail of Comet NEOWISE.  A tale of this tail is the trail of the Earth. As with all comets, the blue ion tail always points away from the Sun. But as Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) rounded our Sun, its ion tail pointed in slightly different directions. This is because between 2020 July 17 and July 25 when the featured images were taken, the Earth moved noticeably in its orbit around the Sun. But the Earth's motion made the Sun appear to shift in the sky. So even though you can't see the Sun directly in the featured image(s), the directions of the ion tails reveal this apparent solar shift. The Sun's apparent motion is in the ecliptic, the common plane where all planets orbit.  The featured five image composite was meticulously composed to accurately place each comet image -- and the five extrapolated solar positions -- on a single foreground image of Turó de l'Home Mountain, north of Barcelona, Spain Comet NEOWISE is no longer the impressive naked-eye object it was last month, but it can still be found with a small telescope as it heads back to the outer Solar System.","shifting, tail, comet, neowise, keep, tale, trail, earth, blue, point, c/2020, rounded, pointed, different, direction, july, featured, image, taken, moved, orbit, motion, made, appear, shift, reveal, apparent, solar, ecliptic, common, plane, planet, composite, composed, place, extrapolated, position, single, foreground, turó, mountain, north, barcelona, spain, impressive, naked-eye, object, last, month, found, small, telescope, head, system"

NGC 5189: An Unusually Complex Planetary Nebula,"Why is this nebula so complex? When a star like our Sun is dying, it will cast off its outer layers, usually into a simple overall shape. Sometimes this shape is a sphere, sometimes a double lobe, and sometimes a ring or a helix.  In the case of planetary nebula NGC 5189, however, besides an overall ""Z"" shape (the featured image is flipped horizontally and so appears as an ""S""), no such simple structure has emerged.  To help find out why, the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope has observed NGC 5189 in great detail. Previous findings indicated the existence of multiple epochs of material outflow, including a recent one that created a bright but distorted torus running horizontally across image center.  Hubble results appear consistent with a hypothesis that the dying star is part of a binary star system with a precessing symmetry axis. NGC 5189 spans about three light years and lies about 3,000 light years away toward the southern constellation of the Fly (Musca).","complex, planetary, nebula, star, dying, cast, outer, layer, simple, overall, shape, sphere, double, lobe, ring, helix, case, featured, image, flipped, appears, structure, emerged, help, find, earth-orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, observed, great, detail, previous, finding, indicated, existence, multiple, epoch, material, outflow, including, recent, created, bright, distorted, torus, running, center, result, appear, consistent, hypothesis, part, binary, system, precessing, symmetry, axis, span, light, year, southern, constellation, musca"
Mars at the Moon's Edge,"Does the Moon ever block out Mars? Yes, the Moon occasionally moves in front of all of the Solar System's planets.  Just this past Sunday, as visible from some locations in South America, a waning gibbous Moon eclipsed Mars.  The featured image from Córdoba, Argentina captured this occultation well, showing a familiar cratered Moon in the foreground with the bright planet Mars unusually adjacent.  Within a few seconds, Mars then disappeared behind the Moon, only to reappear a few minutes later across the Moon.  Today the Moon moves close to, but not in front of, Venus.  Because alignments will not have changed by much, the next two times the Moon passes through this part of the sky – in early September and early October – it will also occult Mars, as seen from parts of South America.

NGC 6814: Grand Design Spiral Galaxy from Hubble,"In the center of this serene stellar swirl is likely a harrowing black-hole beast.  The surrounding swirl sweeps around billions of stars which are highlighted by the brightest and bluest. The breadth and beauty of the display give the swirl the designation of a grand design spiral galaxy. The central beast shows evidence that it is a supermassive black hole about 10 million times the mass of  our Sun.  This ferocious creature devours stars and gas and is surrounded by a spinning moat of hot plasma that emits blasts of X-rays. The central violent activity gives it the designation of a Seyfert galaxy. Together, this beauty and beast are cataloged as NGC 6814 and have been appearing together toward the constellation of the Eagle (Aquila) for roughly the past billion years.

Perseids Around the Milky Way,"Why would meteor trails appear curved? The arcing effect arises only because the image artificially compresses (nearly) the whole sky into a rectangle. The meteors are from the Perseid Meteor Shower that peaked last week. The featured multi-frame image combines not only different directions from the 360 projection, but different times when bright Perseid meteors momentarily streaked across the sky. All Perseid meteors can be traced back to the constellation Perseus toward the lower left, even the seemingly curved (but really straight) meteor trails.  Although Perseids always point back to their Perseus radiant, they can appear almost anywhere on the sky. The image was taken from Inner Mongolia, China, where grasslands meet sand dunes. Many treasures also visible in the busy night sky including the central arch of our Milky Way Galaxy, the planets Saturn and Jupiter toward the right, colorful airglow on the central left, and some relatively nearby Earthly clouds.

TYC 8998-760-1: Multiple Planets around a Sun Like Star,"Do other stars have planets like our Sun? Previous evidence shows that they do, coming mostly from slight shifts in the star's light created by the orbiting planets.  Recently, however, and for the first time, a pair of planets has been directly imaged around a Sun-like star.  These exoplanets orbit the star designated TYC 8998-760-1 and are identified by arrows in the featured infrared image.  At 17 million years old, the parent star is much younger than the 5-billion-year age of our Sun.  Also, the exoplanets are both more massive and orbit further out than their Solar System analogues: Jupiter and Saturn. The exoplanets were found by the ESO's Very Large Telescope in Chile by their infrared glow – after the light from their parent star was artificially blocked.  As telescope and technology improve over the next decade, it is hoped that planets more closely resembling our Earth will be directly imaged.

The Sun Rotating,"Does the Sun change as it rotates? Yes, and the changes can vary from subtle to dramatic. In the featured time-lapse sequences, our Sun -- as imaged by NASA's Solar Dynamics Observatory -- is shown rotating though an entire month in 2014.  In the large image on the left, the solar chromosphere is depicted in ultraviolet light, while the smaller and lighter image to its upper right simultaneously shows the more familiar solar photosphere in visible light. The rest of the inset six Sun images highlight X-ray emission by relatively rare iron atoms located at different heights of the corona, all false-colored to accentuate differences. The Sun takes just under a month to rotate completely -- rotating fastest at the equator. A large and active sunspot region rotates into view soon after the video starts.  Subtle effects include changes in surface texture and the shapes of active regions. Dramatic effects include numerous flashes in active regions, and fluttering and erupting prominences visible all around the Sun's edge.  Presently, our Sun is passing an unusually low  Solar minimum in activity of its 11-year magnetic cycle. As the video ends, the same large and active sunspot region previously mentioned rotates back into view, this time looking different.","rotating, change, rotates, vary, subtle, dramatic, featured, time-lapse, sequence, imaged, nasa, solar, dynamic, observatory, shown, entire, month, large, image, left, depicted, ultraviolet, light, smaller, lighter, upper, show, familiar, visible, rest, inset, highlight, x-ray, emission, rare, iron, atom, located, different, height, corona, false-colored, accentuate, difference, take, rotate, fastest, equator, active, sunspot, region, view, video, start, effect, include, surface, texture, shape, numerous, flash, fluttering, erupting, prominence, edge, passing, minimum, activity, 11-year, magnetic, cycle, mentioned, time, looking"
Seeing Titan,"Shrouded in a thick atmosphere, Saturn's largest moon Titan really is hard to see. Small particles suspended in the upper atmosphere cause an almost impenetrable haze, strongly scattering light at visible wavelengths and hiding Titan's surface features from prying eyes. But Titan's surface is better imaged at infrared wavelengths where scattering is weaker and atmospheric absorption is reduced. Arrayed around this visible light image (center) of Titan are some of the clearest global infrared views of the tantalizing moon so far. In false color, the six panels present a consistent processing of 13 years of infrared image data from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on board the Cassini spacecraft. They offer a stunning comparison with Cassini's visible light view.

Unwinding M51,"The arms of a grand design spiral galaxy 60,000 light-years across are unwound in this digital transformation of the magnificent 2005 Hubble Space Telescope portrait of M51. In fact, M51 is one of the original spiral nebulae, its winding arms described by a mathematical curve known as a logarithmic spiral, a spiral whose separation grows in a geometric way with increasing distance from the center. Applying logarithms to shift the pixel coordinates in the Hubble image relative to the center of M51 maps the galaxy's spiral arms into diagonal straight lines. The transformed image dramatically shows the arms themselves are traced by star formation, lined with pinkish starforming regions and young blue star clusters. Companion galaxy NGC 5195 (top) seems to alter the track of the arm in front of it though, and itself remains relatively unaffected by this unwinding of M51. Also known as the spira mirabilis, logarthimic spirals can be found in nature on all scales. For example, logarithmic spirals can also describe hurricanes, the tracks of subatomic particles in a bubble chamber and, of course, cauliflower.","unwinding, grand, design, spiral, galaxy, light-year, unwound, digital, transformation, magnificent, hubble, space, telescope, portrait, fact, original, nebula, winding, described, mathematical, curve, known, logarithmic, separation, grows, geometric, increasing, distance, center, applying, logarithm, shift, pixel, coordinate, image, relative, diagonal, straight, line, transformed, show, traced, star, formation, lined, pinkish, starforming, region, young, blue, cluster, companion, seems, alter, track, front, remains, unaffected, spira, mirabilis, logarthimic, found, scale, example, describe, hurricane, subatomic, particle, bubble, chamber, course, cauliflower"
Yogi And Friends In 3D,"From July of 1997, a ramp from the Pathfinder lander, the Sojourner robot rover, airbags, a couch, Barnacle Bill and Yogi Rock appear together in this 3D stereo view of the surface of Mars. Barnacle Bill is the rock just left of the solar-paneled Sojourner. Yogi is the big friendly-looking boulder at top right. The ""couch"" is the angular rock shape visible near center on the horizon. Look at the image with red/blue glasses (or just hold a piece of clear red plastic over your left eye and blue or green over your right) to get the dramatic 3D perspective. The stereo view was recorded by the remarkable Imager for Mars Pathfinder (IMP) camera. The IMP had two optical paths for stereo imaging and ranging and was equipped with an array of color filters for spectral analysis.  Operating as the first astronomical observatory on Mars, the IMP also recorded images of the Sun and Deimos, the smallest of Mars' two tiny moons. This July saw the launch of NASA's Mars Perseverance Rover on a mission to the Red Planet.","yogi, friend, july, ramp, pathfinder, lander, sojourner, robot, rover, airbags, couch, barnacle, bill, rock, appear, stereo, view, surface, left, solar-paneled, friendly-looking, boulder, right, angular, shape, visible, center, horizon, look, image, red/blue, glass, hold, piece, clear, plastic, blue, green, dramatic, perspective, recorded, remarkable, imager, camera, optical, path, imaging, ranging, equipped, array, color, filter, spectral, analysis, operating, first, astronomical, observatory, deimos, smallest, tiny, moon, launch, nasa, perseverance, mission, planet"
The Helix Nebula from Blanco and Hubble,"How did a star create the Helix nebula?  The shapes of planetary nebula like the Helix are important because they likely hold clues to how stars like the Sun end their lives.  Observations by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope and the 4-meter Blanco Telescope in Chile, however, have shown the Helix is not really a simple helix.  Rather, it incorporates two nearly perpendicular disks as well as arcs, shocks, and even features not well understood.  Even so, many strikingly geometric symmetries remain.  How a single Sun-like star created such beautiful yet geometric complexity is a topic of research.  The Helix Nebula is the nearest planetary nebula to Earth, lies only about 700 light years away toward the constellation of Aquarius, and spans about 3 light-years.","helix, nebula, blanco, hubble, star, create, shape, planetary, important, likely, hold, clue, life, observation, orbiting, space, telescope, 4-meter, chile, shown, simple, incorporates, perpendicular, disk, shock, many, geometric, symmetry, remain, single, sun-like, created, beautiful, complexity, topic, research, nearest, earth, light, year, constellation, aquarius, span, light-year"
Crescent Moon HDR,"How come the crescent Moon doesn't look like this?  For one reason, because your eyes can't simultaneously discern bright and dark regions like this. Called earthshine or the da Vinci glow, the unlit part of a crescent Moon is visible but usually hard to see because it is much dimmer than the sunlit arc. In our digital age, however, the differences in brightness can be artificially reduced. The featured image is actually a digital composite of 15 short exposures of the bright crescent, and 14 longer exposures of the dim remainder.  The origin of the da Vinci glow, as explained by Leonardo da Vinci about 510 years ago, is sunlight reflected first by the Earth to the Moon, and then back from the Moon to the Earth.","crescent, moon, come, look, reason, simultaneously, discern, bright, dark, region, called, earthshine, vinci, glow, unlit, part, visible, hard, much, dimmer, sunlit, digital, difference, brightness, reduced, featured, image, composite, short, exposure, longer, remainder, origin, explained, leonardo, year, sunlight, reflected, first, earth"
Visualization: A Black Hole Accretion Disk,"What would it look like to circle a black hole? If the black hole was surrounded by a swirling disk of glowing and accreting gas, then the great gravity of the black hole would deflect light emitted by the disk to make it look very unusual. The featured animated video gives a visualization. The video starts with you, the observer, looking toward the black hole from just above the plane of the accretion disk.  Surrounding the central black hole is a thin circular image of the orbiting disk that marks the position of the photon sphere -- inside of which lies the black hole's event horizon.  Toward the left, parts of the large main image of the disk appear brighter as they move toward you. As the video continues, you loop over the black hole, soon looking down from the top, then passing through the disk plane on the far side, then returning to your original vantage point. The accretion disk does some interesting image inversions -- but never appears flat. Visualizations such as this are particularly relevant today as black holes are being imaged in unprecedented detail by the Event Horizon Telescope.","visualization, black, hole, accretion, disk, look, circle, surrounded, swirling, glowing, accreting, great, gravity, deflect, light, emitted, make, unusual, featured, animated, video, give, start, looking, plane, surrounding, central, thin, circular, image, orbiting, mark, position, photon, event, horizon, left, part, large, main, appear, move, continues, loop, passing, returning, original, vantage, point, interesting, inversion, appears, flat, relevant, today, imaged, unprecedented, detail, telescope"
Cygnus Skyscape,"In brush strokes of interstellar dust and glowing hydrogen gas, this beautiful skyscape is painted across the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy near the northern end of the Great Rift and the constellation Cygnus the Swan. Composed using 22 different images and over 180 hours of image data, the widefield mosaic spans an impressive 24 degrees across the sky. Alpha star of Cygnus, bright, hot, supergiant Deneb lies near top center. Crowded with stars and luminous gas clouds Cygnus is also home to the dark, obscuring Northern Coal Sack Nebula, extending from Deneb toward the center of the view. The reddish glow of star forming regions NGC 7000 and IC 5070, the North America Nebula and Pelican Nebulas, are just left of Deneb. The Veil Nebula is a standout below and left of center. A supernova remnant, the Veil is some 1,400 light years away, but many other nebulae and star clusters are identifiable throughout the cosmic scene. Of course, Deneb itself is also known to northern hemisphere skygazers for its place in two asterisms -- marking the top of the Northern Cross and a vertex of the Summer Triangle.

Shell Galaxies in Pisces,"This intergalactic skyscape features a peculiar system of galaxies cataloged as Arp 227 some 100 million light-years distant. Swimming within the boundaries of the constellation Pisces, Arp 227 consists of the two galaxies prominent right of center, the curious shell galaxy NGC 474 and its blue, spiral-armed neighbor NGC 470. The faint, wide arcs or shells of NGC 474 could have been formed by a gravitational encounter with neighbor NGC 470. Alternately the shells could be caused by a merger with a smaller galaxy producing an effect analogous to ripples across the surface of a pond. The large galaxy on the top lefthand side of the deep image, NGC 467, appears to be surrounded by faint shells too, evidence of another interacting galaxy system. Intriguing background galaxies are scattered around the field that also includes spiky foreground stars. Of course, those stars lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy.

Martian Chiaroscuro,"Deep shadows create dramatic contrasts between light and dark in this high-resolution close-up of the martian surface. Recorded on January 24, 2014 by the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, the scene spans about 1.5 kilometers. From 250 kilometers above the Red Planet the camera is looking down at a sand dune field in a southern highlands crater. Captured when the Sun was about 5 degrees above the local horizon, only the dune crests were caught in full sunlight. A long, cold winter was coming to the southern hemisphere and bright ridges of seasonal frost line the martian dunes.

NGC 6357: Cathedral to Massive Stars,"How massive can a normal star be?  Estimates made from distance, brightness and standard solar models had given one star in the open cluster Pismis 24 over 200 times the mass of our Sun, making it one of the most massive stars known.  This star is the brightest object located just above the gas front in the featured image.  Close inspection of images taken with the Hubble Space Telescope, however, have shown that Pismis 24-1 derives its brilliant luminosity not from a single star but from three at least.  Component stars would still remain near 100 solar masses, making them among the more massive stars currently on record.  Toward the bottom of the image, stars are still forming in the associated emission nebula NGC 6357. Appearing perhaps like a Gothic cathedral, energetic stars near the center appear to be breaking out and illuminating a spectacular cocoon.

SS 433: Binary Star Micro-Quasar,"SS 433 is one of the most exotic star systems known.  Its unremarkable name stems from its inclusion in a catalog of Milky Way stars which emit radiation characteristic of atomic hydrogen.  Its remarkable behavior stems from a compact object, a black hole or neutron star, which has produced an accretion disk with jets.  Because the disk and jets from SS 433 resemble those surrounding supermassive black holes in the centers of distant galaxies, SS 433 is considered a micro-quasar.  As illustrated in the animated featured video based on observational data, a massive, hot, normal star is locked in orbit with the compact object.  As the video starts, material is shown being gravitationally ripped from the normal star and falling onto an accretion disk. The central star also blasts out jets of ionized gas in opposite directions – each at about 1/4 the speed of light.  The video then pans out to show a top view of the precessing jets producing an expanding spiral. From even greater distances, the dissipating jets are then visualized near the heart of supernova remnant W50. Two years ago, SS 433 was unexpectedly found by the HAWC detector array in Mexico to emit unusually high energy (TeV-range) gamma-rays. Surprises continue, as a recent analysis of archival data taken by NASA's Fermi satellite find a gamma-ray source -- separated from the central stars as shown -- that pulses in gamma-rays with a period of 162 days – the same as SS 433's jet precession period – for reasons yet unknown.

Salt Water Remnants on Ceres,"Does Ceres have underground pockets of water? Ceres, the largest asteroid in the asteroid belt, was thought to be composed of rock and ice. At the same time, Ceres was known to have unusual bright spots on its surface. These bright spots were clearly imaged during Dawn's exciting approach in 2015. Analyses of Dawn images and spectra indicated that the bright spots arise from the residue of highly-reflective salt water that used to exist on Ceres' surface but evaporated. Recent analysis indicates that some of this water may have originated from deep inside the dwarf planet, indicating Ceres to be a kindred spirit with several  Solar System moons, also thought to harbor deep water pockets.  The featured video shows in false-color pink the bright evaporated brine named Cerealia Facula in Occator Crater.  In 2018, the mission-successful but fuel-depleted Dawn  spacecraft was placed in a distant parking orbit, keeping it away from the Ceres' surface for at least 20 years to avoid interfering with any life that might there exist.

Jupiter and the Moons,"How many moons do you see? Many people would say one, referring to the Earth's Moon, prominent on the lower left. But take a closer look at the object on the upper right. That seeming-star is actually the planet Jupiter, and your closer look might reveal that it is not alone – it is surrounded by some of its largest moons. From left to right these Galilean Moons are Io, Ganymende, Europa and Callisto. These moons orbit the Jovian world just like the planets of our Solar System orbit the Sun, in a line when seen from the side.  The featured single shot was captured from Cancun, Mexico last week as Luna, in its orbit around the Earth, glided past the distant planet.  Even better views of Jupiter are currently being captured by NASA's Juno spacecraft, now in a looping orbit around the Solar System's largest planet.

A Halo for Andromeda,"M31, the Andromeda Galaxy, is the closest large spiral galaxy to our Milky Way. Some 2.5 million light-years distant it shines in Earth's night sky as a small, faint, elongated cloud just visible to the unaided eye. Invisible to the eye though, its enormous halo of hot ionized gas is represented in purplish hues for this digital illustration of our neighboring galaxy above rocky terrain. Mapped by Hubble Space Telescope observations of the absorption of ultraviolet light against distant quasars, the extent and make-up of Andromeda's gaseous halo has been recently determined by the AMIGA project. A reservoir of material for future star formation, Andromeda's halo of diffuse plasma was measured to extend around 1.3 million light-years or more from the galaxy. That's about half way to the Milky Way, likely putting it in contact with the diffuse gaseous halo of our own galaxy.","halo, andromeda, galaxy, closest, large, spiral, milky, light-year, distant, shine, earth, night, small, faint, elongated, cloud, visible, unaided, invisible, enormous, ionized, represented, purplish, digital, illustration, neighboring, rocky, terrain, mapped, hubble, space, telescope, observation, absorption, ultraviolet, light, quasar, extent, make-up, gaseous, determined, amiga, project, reservoir, material, future, star, formation, diffuse, plasma, measured, extend, half, likely, putting, contact"
The Wizard Nebula,"Open star cluster NGC 7380 is still embedded in its natal cloud of interstellar gas and dust popularly known as the Wizard Nebula. Seen on the left, with foreground and background stars along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy it lies some 8,000 light-years distant, toward the constellation Cepheus. In apparent size on the sky, a full moon would cover the 4 million year young cluster and associated nebula, normally much too faint to be seen by eye. Made with telescope and camera firmly planted on Earth, the image reveals multi light-year sized shapes and structures of cosmic gas and dust within the Wizard though, in a color palette made popular in Hubble Space Telescope images.

A Falcon 9 Moon,"Illuminating planet Earth's night, full moons can have many names. This year the last full moon of northern hemisphere summer was on September 2, known to some as the Full Corn Moon. A few days earlier on August 30 this almost full moon rose just before sunset though, shining through cloudy skies over Cape Canaveral Air Force Station on Florida's Space Coast. A well-timed snapshot caught the glare of rocket engines firing below the lunar disk, a Falcon 9 rocket's first stage successfully returning to Cape Canaveral's landing zone 1.

M1: The Crab Nebula from Hubble,"This is the mess that is left when a star explodes.  The Crab Nebula, the result of a supernova seen in 1054 AD, is filled with mysterious filaments.  The filaments are not only tremendously complex, but appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and a higher speed than expected from a free explosion.  The featured image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, is presentedi in three colors chosen for scientific interest.  The Crab Nebula spans about 10 light-years.  In the nebula's very center lies a pulsar: a neutron star as massive as the Sun but with only the size of a small town.  The Crab Pulsar rotates about 30 times each second.","crab, nebula, hubble, mess, left, star, explodes, result, supernova, seen, filled, mysterious, filament, complex, appear, mass, expelled, original, higher, speed, expected, free, explosion, featured, image, taken, space, telescope, presentedi, color, chosen, scientific, interest, span, light-year, center, pulsar, neutron, massive, size, small, town, rotates, time, second"
The Milky Way over St Michael's Mount,"Where do land and sky converge? On every horizon -- but in this case the path on the ground leads to St Michael's Mount (Cornish: Karrek Loos yn Koos), a small historic island in Cornwall, England. The Mount is usually surrounded by shallow water, but at low tide is spanned by a human-constructed causeway.  The path on the sky, actually the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, also appears to lead to St Michael's Mount, but really lies far in the distance.  The red nebula in the Milky Way, just above the castle, is the Lagoon Nebula, while bright Jupiter shines to the left, and a luminous meteor flashes to the right.  The foreground and background images of this featured composite were taken on the same July night and from the same location. Although meteors are fleeting and the Milky Way disk shifts in the night as the Earth turns, Jupiter will remain prominent in the sunset sky into December.

GW190521: Unexpected Black Holes Collide,"How do black holes like this form? The two black holes that spiraled together to produce the gravitational wave event GW190521 were not only the most massive black holes ever seen by LIGO and VIRGO so far, their masses -- 66 and 85 solar masses -- were unprecedented and unexpected. Lower mass black holes, below about 65 solar masses are known to form in supernova explosions.  Conversely, higher mass black holes, above about 135 solar masses, are thought to be created by very massive stars imploding after they use up their weight-bearing nuclear-fusion-producing elements. How such intermediate mass black holes came to exist is yet unknown, although one hypothesis holds that they result from consecutive collisions of stars and black holes in dense star clusters. Featured is an illustration of the black holes just before collision, annotated with arrows indicating their spin axes. In the illustration, the spiral waves indicate the production of gravitational radiation, while the surrounding stars highlight the possibility that the merger occurred in a star cluster.  Seen last year but emanating from an epoch when the universe was only about half its present age (z ~ 0.8), black hole merger GW190521 is the farthest yet detected, to within measurement errors.

Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Star Cluster,"Have you ever seen the Pleiades star cluster? Even if you have, you probably have never seen it as large and clear as this. Perhaps the most famous star cluster on the sky, the bright stars of the Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  With a long exposure from a dark location, though, the dust cloud surrounding the Pleiades star cluster becomes very evident. The featured exposure covers a sky area several times the size of the full moon.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades lies about 400 light years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).  A common legend with a modern twist is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named, leaving only six of the sister stars visible to the unaided eye. The actual number of Pleiades stars visible, however, may be more or less than seven, depending on the darkness of the surrounding sky and the clarity of the observer's eyesight.

Jupiter's Swimming Storm,"A bright storm head with a long turbulent wake swims across Jupiter in these sharp telescopic images of the Solar System's ruling gas giant. Captured on August 26, 28, and September 1 (left to right) the storm approximately doubles in length during that period. Stretching along the jetstream of the planet's North Temperate Belt it travels eastward in successive frames, passing the Great Red Spot and whitish Oval BA, famous storms in Jupiter's southern hemisphere. Galilean moons Callisto and Io are caught in the middle frame. In fact, telescopic skygazers following Jupiter in planet Earth's night have reported dramatic fast moving storm outbreaks over the past few weeks in Jupiter's North Temperate Belt.","jupiter, swimming, storm, bright, head, turbulent, wake, swim, sharp, telescopic, image, solar, system, ruling, giant, captured, september, left, right, double, length, period, stretching, jetstream, planet, north, temperate, belt, travel, successive, frame, passing, great, spot, whitish, oval, famous, southern, hemisphere, galilean, moon, callisto, caught, middle, fact, skygazers, following, earth, night, reported, dramatic, fast, moving, outbreak, week"
The Reappearance of Mars,"Mars reappears just beyond the Moon's dark limb in this stack of sharp video frames captured on September 6. Of course to reappear it had to disappear in the first place. It did that over an hour earlier when the sunlit southern edge of the waning gibbous Moon passed in front of the Red Planet as seen from Maceio, Brazil. The lunar occultation came as the Moon was near apogee, about 400,000 kilometers away. Mars was almost 180 times more distant. It was the fourth lunar occultation of Mars visible from planet Earth in 2020. Visible from some southern latitudes, the fifth lunar occultation of Mars in 2020 will take place on October 3 when the Moon and Mars are both nearly opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky.","reappearance, reappears, moon, dark, limb, stack, sharp, video, frame, captured, september, course, reappear, disappear, first, place, hour, sunlit, southern, edge, waning, gibbous, passed, planet, seen, maceio, brazil, lunar, occultation, came, apogee, kilometer, time, distant, fourth, visible, earth, latitude, fifth, take, october, opposite"
A Thousand Meteors,"Over a thousand meteors flash through the night in this intriguing timelapse video. Starting in April 2019 the individual video frames were selected from 372 relatively clear nights of imaging from an automated wide-field observatory in rural New South Wales Australia. Arranged by local sidereal time, a timekeeping system that uses the positions of stars to measure Earth's rotation, the frames follow the full annual progression of constellations through the wide field of view seen from 33 degrees south latitude. They capture a diverse array of meteors including sporadic meteors, bright fireballs, and shower meteors (plus a lightning sprite), during the period. All frames were processed consistently and so show real variations in the local sky conditions.","meteor, thousand, flash, night, intriguing, timelapse, video, starting, april, individual, frame, selected, clear, imaging, automated, wide-field, observatory, rural, south, wale, australia, arranged, local, sidereal, time, timekeeping, system, position, star, measure, earth, rotation, follow, full, annual, progression, constellation, wide, field, view, seen, degree, latitude, capture, diverse, array, including, sporadic, bright, fireball, shower, lightning, sprite, period, processed, show, real, variation, condition"
M2-9: Wings of a Butterfly Nebula,"Are stars better appreciated for their art after they die?  Actually, stars usually create their most artistic displays as they die.  In the case of low-mass stars like our Sun and M2-9 pictured here, the stars transform themselves from normal stars to white dwarfs by casting off their outer gaseous envelopes.  The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousands of years.  M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale.  In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto.  The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance.  Much remains unknown about the physical processes that cause and shape planetary nebulae.

Corn Moon Rising,"A rising moon can be a dramatic sight.  A rising Full Corn Moon was captured early this month in time-lapse with a telephoto lens from nearly 30 kilometers away -- making Earth's ascending half-degree companion appear unusually impressive.  The image was captured from Portugal, although much of the foreground -- including lights from the village of Puebla de Guzmán  -- is in Spain.  A Full Corn Moon is the name attributed to a full moon at this time of year by cultures of some northern indigenous peoples of the Americas, as it coincides with the ripening of corn.  Note that the Moon does not appear larger when it is nearer the horizon -- its seemingly larger size there is only an illusion.  The next full moon -- occurring at the beginning of next month -- will be known as the Full Harvest Moon as it occurs nearest in time to the northern autumnal equinox and the northern field harvests.","corn, moon, rising, dramatic, sight, full, captured, early, month, time-lapse, telephoto, lens, kilometer, making, earth, ascending, half-degree, companion, appear, impressive, image, portugal, much, foreground, including, light, village, puebla, spain, name, attributed, time, year, culture, northern, indigenous, people, america, coincides, ripening, note, larger, nearer, horizon, size, illusion, occurring, beginning, next, known, harvest, occurs, nearest, autumnal, equinox, field"
Biomarker Phosphine Discovered in the Atmosphere of Venus,"Could there be life floating in the atmosphere of Venus? Although Earth's planetary neighbor has a surface considered too extreme for any known lifeform, Venus' upper atmosphere may be sufficiently mild for tiny airborne microbes. This usually disfavored prospect took an unexpected upturn yesterday with the announcement of the discovery of Venusian phosphine. The chemical phosphine (PH3) is a considered a biomarker because it seems so hard to create from routine chemical processes thought to occur on or around a rocky world such as Venus -- but it is known to be created by microbial life on Earth.  The featured image of Venus and its thick clouds was taken in two bands of ultraviolet light by the Venus-orbing Akatsuki, a Japanese robotic satellite that has been orbiting the cloud-shrouded world since 2015.  The phosphine finding, if confirmed, may set off renewed interest in searching for other indications of life floating high in the atmosphere of our Solar System's second planet out from the Sun.

Gravel Ejected from Asteroid Bennu,"Why does asteroid Bennu eject gravel into space?  No one is sure. The discovery, occurring during several episodes by NASA's visiting OSIRIS-REx spacecraft, was unexpected. Leading ejection hypotheses include impacts by Sun-orbiting meteoroids, sudden thermal fractures of internal structures, and the sudden release of a water vapor jet.  The featured two-image composite shows an ejection event that occurred in early 2019, with sun-reflecting ejecta seen on the right. Data and simulations show that large gravel typically falls right back to the rotating 500-meter asteroid, while smaller rocks skip around the surface, and the smallest rocks completely escape the low gravity of the Earth approaching, diamond-shaped asteroid. Jets and surface ejection events were thought to be predominantly the domain of comets, responsible for their tails, comas, and later meteor showers on Earth. Robotic OSIRIS-REx arrived at 101955 Bennu in late 2018, and is planned to touchdown to collect a surface sample in October 2020. If all goes well, this sample will then be returned to Earth for a detailed analysis during 2023.  Bennu was chosen as the destination for OSIRIS-REx in part because its surface shows potential to reveal organic compounds from the early days of our Solar System, compounds that could have been the building blocks for life on Earth.

Solar Cycle 25 Has Begun,"The general trend of monthly sunspot data now confirms that the minimum of the approximately 11 year cycle of solar activity occurred in December 2019, marking the start of Solar Cycle 25. That quiet Sun, at minimum activity, appears on the right of this split hemispherical view. In contrast, the left side shows the active Sun at the recognized maximum of Solar Cycle 24, captured in April 2014. The extreme ultraviolet images from the orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory highlight coronal loops and active regions in the light of highly ionized iron atoms. Driving the space weather around our fair planet, Solar Cycle 24 was a relatively calm one and predictions are that cycle 25 will be calm too. The cycle 25 activity maximum is expected in July 2025. Solar Cycle 1, the first solar cycle determined from early records of sunspot data, is considered to begin with a minimum in February 1755.","solar, cycle, begun, general, trend, monthly, sunspot, data, confirms, minimum, year, activity, occurred, december, marking, start, quiet, appears, right, split, hemispherical, view, contrast, left, side, show, active, recognized, maximum, captured, extreme, ultraviolet, image, orbiting, dynamic, observatory, highlight, coronal, loop, region, light, ionized, iron, atom, driving, space, weather, fair, planet, calm, prediction, expected, first, determined, early, record, considered, begin, february"
Arp 78: Peculiar Galaxy in Aries,"Peculiar spiral galaxy Arp 78 is found within the boundaries of the head strong constellation Aries, some 100 million light-years beyond the stars and nebulae of our Milky Way galaxy. Also known as NGC 772, the island universe is over 100,000 light-years across and sports a single prominent outer spiral arm in this detailed cosmic portrait. Its brightest companion galaxy, compact NGC 770, is toward the upper right of the larger spiral. NGC 770's fuzzy, elliptical appearance contrasts nicely with a spiky foreground Milky Way star in matching yellowish hues. Tracking along sweeping dust lanes and lined with young blue star clusters, Arp 78's large spiral arm is likely due to gravitational tidal interactions. Faint streams of material seem to connect Arp 78 with its nearby companion galaxies.","peculiar, galaxy, aries, spiral, found, boundary, head, strong, constellation, light-year, star, nebula, milky, known, island, universe, sport, single, prominent, outer, detailed, cosmic, portrait, brightest, companion, compact, upper, right, larger, fuzzy, elliptical, appearance, contrast, spiky, foreground, matching, yellowish, tracking, sweeping, dust, lane, lined, young, blue, cluster, large, gravitational, tidal, interaction, faint, stream, material, seem, connect, nearby"
Orion in Depth,"Orion is a familiar constellation. The apparent positions of its stars in two dimensions create a well-known pattern on the bowl of planet Earth's night sky. Orion may not look quite so familiar in this 3D view though. The illustration reconstructs the relative positions of Orion's bright stars, including data from the Hipparcus catalog of parallax distances. The most distant star shown is Alnilam. The middle one in the projected line of three that make up Orion's belt when viewed from planet Earth, Alnilam is nearly 2,000 light-years away, almost 3 times as far as fellow belt stars Alnitak and Mintaka. Though Rigel and Betelgeuse apparently shine brighter in planet Earth's sky, that makes more distant Alnilam intrinsically (in absolute magnitude) the brightest of the familiar stars in Orion. In the Hipparcus catalog, errors in measured parallaxes for Orion's stars can translate in to distance errors of a 100 light-years or so.","orion, depth, familiar, constellation, apparent, position, star, dimension, create, well-known, pattern, bowl, planet, earth, night, look, view, illustration, reconstructs, relative, bright, including, data, hipparcus, catalog, parallax, distance, distant, shown, alnilam, middle, projected, line, make, belt, viewed, light-year, time, fellow, alnitak, mintaka, rigel, betelgeuse, shine, brighter, absolute, magnitude, brightest, error, measured, translate"
Breaking Distant Light,"In the distant universe, time appears to run slowly.  Since time-dilated light appears shifted toward the red end of the spectrum (redshifted), astronomers are able to use cosmological time-slowing to help measure vast distances in the universe.  Featured, the light from distant galaxies has been broken up into its constituent colors (spectra), allowing astronomers to measure the cosmological redshift of known spectral lines.  The novelty of the featured image is that the distance to hundreds of galaxies can be measured from a single frame, in this case one taken by the Visible MultiObject Spectrograph (VIMOS) operating at the Very Large Telescope (VLT) array in Chile.  Analyzing the space distribution of distant objects will allow insight into when and how stars and galaxies formed, clustered, and evolved in the early universe.","breaking, distant, light, universe, time, appears, time-dilated, shifted, spectrum, redshifted, astronomer, able, cosmological, time-slowing, help, measure, vast, distance, featured, galaxy, broken, constituent, color, allowing, redshift, known, spectral, line, novelty, image, hundred, measured, single, frame, case, taken, visible, multiobject, spectrograph, vimos, operating, large, telescope, array, chile, analyzing, space, distribution, object, allow, insight, star, formed, clustered, evolved, early"
Omega Sunrise,"Capturing this sunrise required both luck and timing.  First and foremost, precise timing was needed to capture a sailboat crossing right in front of a rising Sun.  Additionally, by a lucky coincidence, the background Sun itself appears unusual -- it looks like the Greek letter Omega (Ω).  In reality, the Sun remained its circular self -- the Omega illusion was created by sunlight refracting through warm air just above the water.  Optically, the feet of the capital Omega are actually an inverted image of the Sun region just above it.  Although somewhat rare, optical effects caused by the Earth's atmosphere can make distant objects near the horizon -- including the Sun and Moon -- look quite unusual.  This single exposure image was taken over the Mediterranean Sea just over two weeks ago near Valencia, Spain.","omega, sunrise, capturing, required, luck, timing, first, foremost, precise, needed, capture, sailboat, crossing, right, front, rising, lucky, coincidence, background, appears, unusual, look, greek, letter, reality, remained, circular, self, illusion, created, sunlight, refracting, warm, water, foot, capital, inverted, image, region, rare, optical, effect, caused, earth, atmosphere, make, distant, object, horizon, including, moon, single, exposure, taken, mediterranean, week, valencia, spain"
Equinox in the Sky,"Does the Sun set in the same direction every day? No, the direction of sunset depends on the time of the year. Although the Sun always sets approximately toward the west, on an equinox like today the Sun sets directly toward the west. After today's September equinox, the Sun will set increasingly toward the southwest, reaching its maximum displacement at the December solstice.  Before today's September equinox, the Sun had set toward the northwest, reaching its maximum displacement at the June solstice. The featured time-lapse image shows seven bands of the Sun setting one day each month from 2019 December through 2020 June.  These image sequences were taken from Alberta, Canada -- well north of the Earth's equator -- and feature the city of Edmonton in the foreground.  The middle band shows the Sun setting during the last equinox -- in March.  From this location, the Sun will set along this same equinox band again today.","equinox, direction, sunset, depends, time, year, west, today, september, southwest, reaching, maximum, displacement, december, solstice, northwest, june, featured, time-lapse, image, show, band, setting, month, sequence, taken, canada, earth, equator, feature, city, edmonton, foreground, middle, last, march, location"
ISS Transits Mars,"Yes, but have you ever seen the space station do this? If you know when and where to look, watching the bright International Space Station (ISS) drift across your night sky is a fascinating sight -- but not very unusual.  Images of the ISS crossing in front of the half-degree Moon or Sun do exist, but are somewhat rare as they take planning, timing, and patience to acquire.  Catching the ISS crossing in front of minuscule Mars, though, is on another level. Using online software, the featured photographer learned that the unusual transit would be visible only momentarily along a very narrow stretch of nearby land spanning just 90 meters.  Within this stretch, the equivalent ground velocity of the passing ISS image would be a quick 7.4 kilometers per second. However, with a standard camera, a small telescope, an exact location to set up his equipment, an exact direction to point the telescope, and sub-millisecond timing -- he created a video from which the featured 0.00035 second exposure was extracted.  In the resulting image capture, details on both Mars and the ISS are visible simultaneously.  The featured image was acquired last Monday at 05:15:47 local time from just northeast of San Diego, California, USA.  Although typically much smaller, angularly, than the ISS, Mars is approaching its maximum angular size in the next few weeks, because the blue planet (Earth) is set to pass its closest to the red planet (Mars) in their respective orbits around the Sun.

Enceladus in Infrared,"One of our Solar System's most tantalizing worlds, icy Saturnian moon Enceladus appears in these detailed hemisphere views from the Cassini spacecraft. In false color, the five panels present 13 years of infrared image data from Cassini's Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer and Imaging Science Subsystem. Fresh ice is colored red, and the most dramatic features look like long gashes in the 500 kilometer diameter moon's south polar region. They correspond to the location of tiger stripes, surface fractures that likely connect to an ocean beneath the Enceladus ice shell. The fractures are the source of the moon's icy plumes that continuously spew into space. The plumes were discovered by by Cassini in 2005. Now, reddish hues in the northern half of the leading hemisphere view also indicate a recent resurfacing of other regions of the geologically active moon, a world that may hold conditions suitable for life.

Moon over Andromeda,"The Great Spiral Galaxy in Andromeda (also known as M31), a mere 2.5 million light-years distant, is the closest large spiral to our own Milky Way. Andromeda is visible to the unaided eye as a small, faint, fuzzy patch, but because its surface brightness is so low, casual skygazers can't appreciate the galaxy's impressive extent in planet Earth's sky. This entertaining composite image compares the angular size of the nearby galaxy to a brighter, more familiar celestial sight. In it, a deep exposure of Andromeda, tracing beautiful blue star clusters in spiral arms far beyond the bright yellow core, is combined with a typical view of a nearly full Moon. Shown at the same angular scale, the Moon covers about 1/2 degree on the sky, while the galaxy is clearly several times that size.

Moon Pairs and the Synodic Month,"Observe the Moon each night and its visible sunlit portion will gradually change. In phases progressing from New Moon to Full Moon to New Moon again, a lunar cycle or synodic month is completed in about 29.5 days. They look full, but top left to bottom right these panels do show the range of lunar phases for a complete synodic month during August 2019 from Ragusa, Sicily, Italy, planet Earth. For this lunar cycle project the panels organize images of the lunar phases in pairs. Each individual image is paired with another image separated by about 15 days, or approximately half a synodic month. As a result the opposite sunlit portions complete the lunar disk and the shadow line at the boundary of lunar night and day, the terminator, steadily marches across the Moon's familiar nearside.

Lightning over Colorado,"Have you ever watched a lightning storm in awe?  Join the crowd. Oddly, details about how lightning is produced remains a topic of research. What is known is that updrafts carry light ice crystals into collisions with larger and softer ice balls, causing the smaller crystals to become positively charged.  After enough charge becomes separated, the rapid electrical discharge that is lightning occurs. Lightning usually takes a jagged course, rapidly heating a thin column of air to about three times the surface temperature of the Sun.  The resulting shock wave starts supersonically and decays into the loud sound known as thunder.  Lightning bolts are common in clouds during rainstorms, and on average 44 lightning bolts occur on the  Earth every second. Pictured, over 60 images were stacked to capture the flow of lightning-producing storm clouds in July over Colorado Springs, Colorado, USA.

Filaments of the Cygnus Loop,"What lies at the edge of an expanding supernova?  Subtle and delicate in appearance, these ribbons of shocked interstellar gas are part of a blast wave at the expanding edge of a violent stellar explosion that would have been easily visible to humans during the late stone age, about 20,000 years ago.  The featured image was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope and is a closeup of the outer edge of a supernova remnant known as the Cygnus Loop or Veil Nebula.  The filamentary shock front is moving toward the top of the frame at about 170 kilometers per second, while glowing in light emitted by atoms of excited hydrogen gas.  The distances to stars thought to be interacting with the Cygnus Loop have recently been found by the Gaia mission to be about 2400 light years distant.  The whole Cygnus Loop spans six full Moons across the sky, corresponding to about 130 light years, and parts can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).","filament, cygnus, loop, edge, expanding, supernova, subtle, delicate, appearance, ribbon, shocked, interstellar, part, blast, wave, violent, stellar, explosion, visible, human, late, stone, year, featured, image, recorded, hubble, space, telescope, closeup, outer, remnant, known, nebula, filamentary, shock, front, moving, frame, kilometer, second, glowing, light, emitted, excited, hydrogen, distance, star, thought, interacting, found, mission, distant, whole, span, full, moon, corresponding, seen, small, constellation, swan"
GW Orionis: A Star System with Tilted Rings,"Triple star system GW Orionis appears to demonstrate that planets can form and orbit in multiple planes. In contrast, all the planets and moons in our Solar System orbit in nearly the same plane.  The picturesque system has three prominent stars, a warped disk, and inner tilted rings of gas and grit.  The featured animation characterizes the GW Ori system from observations with the European Southern Observatory's VLT and ALMA telescopes in Chile. The first part of the illustrative video shows a grand vista of the entire system from a distant orbit, while the second sequence takes you inside the tilted rings to resolve the three central co-orbiting stars.  Computer simulations indicate that multiple stars in systems like GW Ori could warp and break-up disks into unaligned, exoplanet-forming rings.","star, system, tilted, ring, triple, orionis, appears, demonstrate, planet, form, orbit, multiple, plane, contrast, moon, solar, picturesque, prominent, warped, disk, inner, grit, featured, animation, characterizes, observation, european, southern, observatory, telescope, chile, first, part, illustrative, video, show, grand, vista, entire, distant, second, sequence, take, resolve, central, co-orbiting, computer, simulation, indicate, warp, break-up, unaligned, exoplanet-forming"
Sonified: Eagle Nebula Pillars,"Yes, but have you ever experienced the Eagle Nebula with your ears ? The famous nebula, M16, is best known for the feast it gives your eyes, highlighting bright young stars forming deep inside dark towering structures.  These light-years long columns of cold gas and dust are some 6,500 light-years distant toward the constellation of the Serpent (Serpens).  Sculpted and eroded by the energetic ultraviolet light and powerful winds from M16's cluster of massive stars, the cosmic pillars themselves are destined for destruction.  But the turbulent environment of star formation within M16, whose spectacular details are captured in this combined Hubble (visible) and Chandra (X-ray) image, is likely similar to the environment that formed our own Sun.

Solis Lacus: The Eye of Mars,"As telescopes around planet Earth watch, Mars is growing brighter in night skies, approaching its 2020 opposition on October 13. Mars looks like it's watching too in this view of the Red Planet from September 22. Mars' disk is already near its maximum apparent size for earthbound telescopes, less than 1/80th the apparent diameter of a Full Moon. The seasonally shrinking south polar cap is at the bottom and hazy northern clouds are at the top. A circular, dark albedo feature, Solis Lacus (Lake of the Sun), is just below and left of disk center. Surrounded by a light area south of Valles Marineris, Solis Lacus looks like a planet-sized pupil, famously known as The Eye of Mars . Near the turn of the 20th century, astronomer and avid Mars watcher Percival Lowell associated the Eye of Mars with a conjunction of canals he charted in his drawings of the Red Planet. Broad, visible changes in the size and shape of the Eye of Mars are now understood from high resolution surface images to be due to dust transported by winds in the thin Martian atmosphere.","solis, lacus, telescope, planet, earth, watch, growing, brighter, night, approaching, opposition, october, look, watching, view, september, disk, maximum, apparent, size, 1/80th, diameter, full, moon, shrinking, south, polar, bottom, hazy, northern, cloud, circular, dark, albedo, feature, lake, left, center, surrounded, light, area, valles, marineris, planet-sized, pupil, known, turn, 20th, century, astronomer, avid, watcher, percival, lowell, associated, conjunction, canal, charted, drawing, broad, visible, change, shape, understood, high, resolution, surface, image, transported, wind, thin, martian, atmosphere"
Biking to the Moon,"As you watched October's first Full Moon rise last night, the Full Moon closest to the northern autumnal equinox, you were probably asking yourself, ""How long would it take to bike to the Moon?"" Sure, Apollo 11 astronauts made the trip in 1969, from launch to Moon landing, in about 103 hours or 4.3 days. But the Moon is 400,000 kilometers away. This year, the top bike riders in planet Earth's well-known Tour de France race covered almost 3,500 kilometers in 21 stages after about 87 hours on the road. That gives an average speed of about 40 kilometers per hour and a lunar cycling travel time of 10,000 hours, a little over 416 days. While this bike rider's destination isn't clear, his journey did begin around moonrise on September 27 near Cleeve Hill, Bishops Cleeve, Cheltenham, UK.","biking, moon, watched, october, first, full, rise, last, night, closest, northern, autumnal, equinox, asking, take, bike, sure, apollo, astronaut, made, trip, launch, landing, hour, kilometer, year, rider, planet, earth, well-known, tour, france, race, covered, stage, road, give, average, speed, lunar, cycling, travel, time, little, destination, clear, journey, begin, moonrise, september, cleeve, hill, bishop, cheltenham"
Driving to the Sun,"How long would it take to drive to the Sun? Brittany age 7, and D.J. age 12, ponder this question over dinner one evening. James also age 7, suggests taking a really fast racing car while Christopher age 4, eagerly agrees. Jerry, a really old guy who is used to estimating driving time on family trips based on distance divided by speed, offers to do the numbers. ""Let's see ... the Sun is 93 million miles away. If we drove 93 miles per hour the trip would only take us 1 million hours."" How long is 1 million hours? One year is 365 days times 24 hours per day, or 8,760 hours. One hundred years would be 876,000 hours, but that's still a little short of the 1 million hour drive time. So the Sun is really quite far away. Christopher is not impressed, but as he grows older he will be.

"Orion Nebula in Oxygen, Hydrogen, and Sulfur","Few astronomical sights excite the imagination like the nearby stellar nursery known as the Orion Nebula.  The Nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud.  Many of the filamentary structures visible in the featured image are actually shock waves - fronts where fast moving material encounters slow moving gas.  The Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located about 1500 light years away in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.  The Great Nebula in Orion can be found with the unaided eye just below and to the left of the easily identifiable belt of three stars in the popular constellation Orion.  The image shows the nebula in three colors specifically emitted by hydrogen, oxygen, and sulfur gas.  The whole Orion Nebula cloud complex, which includes the Horsehead Nebula, will slowly disperse over the next 100,000 years.","orion, nebula, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, astronomical, sight, excite, imagination, nearby, stellar, nursery, known, glowing, surround, young, star, edge, immense, interstellar, molecular, cloud, many, filamentary, structure, visible, featured, image, shock, wave, front, moving, material, encounter, slow, span, light, year, located, spiral, galaxy, great, found, unaided, left, identifiable, belt, popular, constellation, show, color, emitted, whole, complex, includes, horsehead, disperse, next"
NGC 5643: Nearby Spiral Galaxy from Hubble,"What's happening at the center of spiral galaxy NGC 5643?  A swirling disk of stars and gas, NGC 5643's appearance is dominated by blue spiral arms and brown  dust, as shown in the featured image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.   The core of this active galaxy glows brightly in radio waves and X-rays where twin jets have been found.  An unusual central glow makes NGC 5643 one of the closest examples of the Seyfert class of galaxies, where vast amounts of glowing gas are thought to be falling into a central massive black hole.  NGC 5643, is a relatively close 55 million light years away, spans about 100 thousand light years across, and can be seen with a small telescope towards the constellation of the Wolf (Lupus).","nearby, spiral, galaxy, hubble, happening, center, swirling, disk, star, appearance, dominated, blue, brown, dust, shown, featured, image, taken, space, telescope, core, active, glow, radio, wave, x-ray, twin, found, unusual, central, make, closest, example, seyfert, class, vast, amount, glowing, thought, falling, massive, black, hole, close, light, year, span, thousand, seen, small, towards, constellation, wolf, lupus"
Mars Approach 2020,"Look to the east just after sunset tonight and you'll see a most impressive Mars. Tonight, Mars will appear its biggest and brightest of the year, as Earth passes closer to the red planet than it has in over two years -- and will be again for another two years.  In a week, Mars will be almost as bright -- but at opposition, meaning that it will be directly opposite the Sun. Due to the slightly oval shape of the orbits of Mars and Earth, closest approach and opposition occur on slightly different days. The featured image sequence shows how the angular size of Mars has grown during its approach over the past few months. Noticeably orange, Mars is now visible nearly all night long, reflecting more sunlight toward Earth than either Saturn or Jupiter.  Even at its closest and largest, though, Mars will still appear about 100 times smaller, in diameter, than a full moon.","approach, look, east, sunset, tonight, impressive, appear, biggest, brightest, year, earth, pass, closer, planet, week, bright, opposition, meaning, opposite, oval, shape, orbit, closest, occur, different, featured, image, sequence, show, angular, size, grown, past, month, orange, visible, night, long, reflecting, sunlight, saturn, jupiter, largest, time, smaller, diameter, full, moon"
Ou4: A Giant Squid in a Flying Bat,"A very faint but very large squid-like nebula is visible in planet Earth's sky -- but inside a still larger bat.  The Giant Squid Nebula cataloged as Ou4, and Sh2-129 also known as the Flying Bat Nebula, are both caught in this cosmic scene toward the royal royal constellation Cepheus. Composed with 55 hours of narrowband image data, the telescopic field of view is 3 degrees or 6 Full Moons across. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula's alluring bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently completely surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, Ou4 would represent a spectacular outflow driven by HR8119, a triple system of hot, massive stars seen near the center of the nebula. The truly giant Squid Nebula would physically be nearly 50 light-years across.

Mare Frigoris,"Lighter than typically dark, smooth, mare the Mare Frigoris lies in the far lunar north. Also known as the Sea of Cold, it stretches across the familiar lunar nearside in this close up of the waxing gibbous Moon's north polar region. Dark-floored, 95 kilometer wide crater Plato is just left of the center. Sunlit peaks of the lunar Alps (Montes Alpes) are highlighted below and right of Plato, between the more southern Mare Imbrium (Sea of Rains) and Mare Frigoris.

The Very Large Array at Moonset,"An inspirational sight, these giant dish antennas of the Karl G. Jansky Very Large Array (VLA) rise above the New Mexico desert at moonset.  Mounted on piers but transportable on railroad tracks to change the VLA’s configuration, its 27 operating antennas are each house-sized (25 meters across) and can be organized into an array spanning the size of a city (35 kilometers). A prolific radio astronomy workhorse, the VLA has been used to discover water on planet Mercury, radio-bright coronae around stars, micro-quasars in our Galaxy, gravitationally-induced Einstein rings around distant galaxies, and radio counterparts to cosmologically distant gamma-ray bursts. Its vast size has allowed astronomers to study the details of radio galaxies, super-fast cosmic jets, and map the center of our own Milky Way. Now 40 years since its dedication the VLA has been used in more than 14,000 observing projects and contributed to more than 500 Ph.D. dissertations. On October 10, the National Radio Astronomy Observatory will host a day-long online celebration of the VLA at 40 featuring virtual tours and presentations on the history, operations, science, and future of the Very Large Array.","large, array, moonset, inspirational, sight, giant, dish, antenna, karl, jansky, rise, mexico, desert, mounted, transportable, railroad, track, change, configuration, operating, house-sized, meter, organized, spanning, size, city, kilometer, prolific, radio, astronomy, workhorse, used, water, planet, mercury, radio-bright, corona, star, micro-quasars, galaxy, gravitationally-induced, einstein, ring, distant, counterpart, gamma-ray, burst, vast, allowed, astronomer, study, detail, super-fast, cosmic, center, milky, year, dedication, observing, project, contributed, ph.d., dissertation, national, observatory, host, day-long, online, celebration, featuring, virtual, tour, presentation, history, operation, science, future"
Virgo Cluster Galaxies,"Galaxies of the Virgo Cluster are scattered across this deep telescopic field of view. The cosmic scene spans about three Full Moons, captured in dark skies near Jalisco, Mexico, planet Earth. About 50 million light-years distant, the Virgo Cluster is the closest large galaxy cluster to our own local galaxy group. Prominent here are Virgo's bright elliptical galaxies from the Messier catalog, M87 at the top left, and M84 and M86 seen (bottom to top) below and right of center. M84 and M86 are recognized as part of Markarian's Chain, a visually striking line-up of galaxies vertically on the right side of this frame. Near the middle of the chain lies an intriguing interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435, known to some as Markarian's Eyes. Of course giant elliptical galaxy M87 dominates the Virgo cluster.

Milky Way over the Pinnacles in Australia,"What strange world is this? Earth. In the foreground of the featured image are the Pinnacles, unusual rock spires in Nambung National Park in Western Australia. Made of ancient sea shells (limestone), how these human-sized picturesque spires formed remains unknown.  In the background, just past the end of the central Pinnacle, is a bright crescent Moon. The eerie glow around the Moon is mostly zodiacal light, sunlight reflected by dust grains orbiting between the planets in the Solar System. Arching across the top is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy. Many famous stars and nebulas are also visible in the background night sky. The featured 29-panel panorama was taken and composed in 2015 September after detailed planning that involved the Moon, the rock spires, and their corresponding shadows.

Descending Toward Asteroid Bennu,"What would it be like to land on an asteroid?  Although no human has yet done it, NASA's robotic OSIRIS-REx spacecraft is scheduled to attempt to touch the surface of asteroid 101955 Bennu next week.  The goal is to collect a sample from the nearby minor planet for return to Earth for a detailed analysis in 2023. The featured video shows what it looks like to descend toward the 500-meter diamond-shaped asteroid, based on a digital map of Bennu's rocky surface constructed from image and surface data taken by OSIRIS-REx over the past 1.5 years.  The video begins by showing a rapidly spinning Bennu -- much faster than its real rotation period of 4.3 hours.  After the rotation stops, the virtual camera drops you down to just above the rugged surface and circles a house-sized rock outcrop named Simurgh, with the flatter outcrop Roc visible behind it.  If the return sample reaches Earth successfully, it will be scrutinized for organic compounds that might have seeded a young Earth, rare or unusual elements and minerals, and clues about the early history of our Solar System.","descending, asteroid, bennu, like, land, human, done, nasa, robotic, osiris-rex, spacecraft, scheduled, attempt, touch, surface, next, week, goal, collect, sample, nearby, minor, planet, return, earth, detailed, analysis, featured, video, show, look, descend, 500-meter, diamond-shaped, based, digital, rocky, constructed, image, data, taken, past, year, showing, spinning, much, faster, real, rotation, period, hour, stop, virtual, camera, drop, rugged, circle, house-sized, rock, outcrop, named, simurgh, flatter, visible, reach, scrutinized, organic, compound, seeded, young, rare, unusual, element, mineral, clue, early, history, solar, system"
"Mars, Pleiades, and Andromeda over Stone Lions","Three very different -- and very famous -- objects were all captured in a single frame last month. On the upper left is the bright blue Pleiades, perhaps the most famous cluster of stars on the night sky.  The Pleiades (M45) is about 450 light years away and easily found a few degrees from Orion.  On the upper right is the expansive Andromeda Galaxy, perhaps the most famous galaxy -- external to our own -- on the night sky.  Andromeda (M31) is one of few objects visible to the unaided eye where you can see light that is millions of years old.  In the middle is bright red Mars, perhaps the most famous planet on the night sky. Today Mars is at opposition, meaning that it is opposite the Sun, with the result that it is visible all night long.  In the foreground is an ancient tomb in the Phygrian Valley in Turkey.  The tomb, featuring two stone lions, is an impressive remnant of a powerful civilization that lived thousands of years ago.  Mars, currently near its brightest, can be easily found toward the east just after sunset.","pleiades, andromeda, stone, lion, different, famous, object, captured, single, frame, last, month, upper, left, bright, blue, cluster, star, night, light, year, found, degree, orion, right, expansive, galaxy, external, visible, unaided, middle, planet, today, opposition, meaning, opposite, result, foreground, ancient, tomb, phygrian, valley, turkey, featuring, impressive, remnant, powerful, civilization, lived, brightest, east, sunset"
The Colorful Clouds of Rho Ophiuchi,"The many spectacular colors of the Rho Ophiuchi (oh'-fee-yu-kee) clouds highlight the many processes that occur there.  The blue regions shine primarily by reflected light.  Blue light from the  Rho Ophiuchi star system and nearby stars reflects more efficiently off this portion of the nebula than red light.  The Earth's daytime sky appears blue for the same reason.  The red and yellow regions shine primarily because of emission from the nebula's atomic and molecular gas.  Light from nearby blue stars - more energetic than the bright star  Antares - knocks electrons away from the gas, which then shines when the electrons recombine with the gas.  The dark brown regions are caused by dust grains - born in young stellar atmospheres - which effectively block light emitted behind them.  The Rho Ophiuchi star clouds, well in front of the globular cluster M4 visible here on the upper right, are even more colorful than humans can see - the clouds emits light in every wavelength band from the radio to the gamma-ray.

Galaxies in Pegasus,"This sharp telescopic view reveals galaxies scattered beyond the stars of the Milky Way, at the northern boundary of the high-flying constellation Pegasus. Prominent at the upper right is NGC 7331. A mere 50 million light-years away, the large spiral is one of the brighter galaxies not included in Charles Messier's famous 18th century catalog. The disturbed looking group of galaxies at the lower left is well-known as Stephan's Quintet. About 300 million light-years distant, the quintet dramatically illustrates a multiple galaxy collision, its powerful, ongoing interactions posed for a brief cosmic snapshot.

Planetary Nebula Abell 78,"Planetary nebula Abell 78 stands out in this colorful telescopic skyscape. In fact the colors of the spiky Milky Way stars depend on their surface temperatures, both cooler (yellowish) and hotter (bluish) than the Sun. But Abell 78 shines by the characteristic emission of ionized atoms in the tenuous shroud of material shrugged off from an intensely hot central star. The atoms are ionized, their electrons stripped away, by the central star's energetic but otherwise invisible ultraviolet light. The visible blue-green glow of loops and filaments in the nebula's central region corresponds to emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms, surrounded by strong red emission from electrons recombining with hydrogen atoms. Some 5,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Cygnus, Abell 78 is about three light-years across. A planetary nebula like Abell 78 represents a very brief final phase in stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience ... in about 5 billion years.","planetary, nebula, stand, colorful, telescopic, skyscape, fact, color, spiky, milky, star, depend, surface, temperature, cooler, yellowish, hotter, bluish, abell, shine, characteristic, emission, ionized, tenuous, shroud, material, shrugged, central, atom, electron, stripped, energetic, invisible, ultraviolet, light, visible, blue-green, glow, loop, filament, region, corresponds, oxygen, surrounded, strong, recombining, hydrogen, light-year, distant, constellation, cygnus, represents, brief, final, phase, stellar, evolution, experience, year"
Cygnus: Bubble and Crescent,"These clouds of gas and dust drift through rich star fields along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the high flying constellation Cygnus. Caught within the telescopic field of view are the Soap Bubble (lower left) and the Crescent Nebula (upper right). Both were formed at a final phase in the life of a star. Also known as NGC 6888, the Crescent was shaped as its bright, central massive Wolf-Rayet star, WR 136, shed its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind. Burning through fuel at a prodigious rate, WR 136 is near the end of a short life that should finish in a spectacular supernova explosion.  Discovered in 2013, the Soap Bubble Nebula is likely a planetary nebula, the final shroud of a lower mass, long-lived, sun-like star destined to become a slowly cooling white dwarf. Both stellar shrouds are 5,000 light-years or so distant.

UGC 1810: Wildly Interacting Galaxy from Hubble,"What's happening to this spiral galaxy? Although details remain uncertain, it surely has to do with an ongoing battle with its smaller galactic neighbor. The featured galaxy is labelled UGC 1810 by itself, but together with its collisional partner is known as Arp 273. The overall shape of UGC 1810 -- in particular its blue outer ring -- is likely a result of wild and violent gravitational interactions. This ring's blue color is caused by massive stars that are blue hot and have formed only in the past few million years.  The inner galaxy appears older, redder, and threaded with cool filamentary dust.  A few bright stars appear well in the foreground, unrelated to UGC 1810, while several galaxies are visible well in the background.  Arp 273 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of Andromeda.  Quite likely, UGC 1810 will devour its galactic sidekick over the next billion years and settle into a classic spiral form.

Saturn and Jupiter over Italian Peaks,"Saturn and Jupiter are getting closer. Every night that you go out and check for the next two months, these two bright planets will be even closer together on the sky.  Finally, in mid-December, a Great Conjunction will occur -- when the two planets will appear only 0.1 degrees apart -- just one fifth the angular diameter of the full Moon. And this isn't just any Great Conjunction -- Saturn (left) and Jupiter (right) haven't been this close since 1623, and won't be nearly this close again until 2080.  This celestial event is quite easy to see -- already the two planets are easily visible toward the southwest just after sunset -- and already they are remarkably close.

A Night Sky Vista from Sardinia,"How many famous sky objects can you find in this image?  The featured dark sky composite combines over 60 exposures spanning over 220 degrees to create a veritable menagerie of night sky wonders. Visible celestial icons include the Belt of Orion, the Orion Nebula, the Andromeda Galaxy, the California Nebula, and bright stars Sirius and Betelgeuse.  You can verify that you found these, if you did, by checking an annotated version of the image.  A bit harder, though, is finding Polaris and the Big Dipper. Also discernible are several meteors from the Quandrantids meteor shower, red and green airglow, and two friends of the astrophotographer.  The picture was captured in January from Sardinia, Italy.  You can see sky wonders in your own night sky tonight -- including more meteors than usual -- because tonight is near peak of the yearly Orionids meteor shower.

Tagging Bennu,"On October 20, after a careful approach to the boulder-strewn surface, the OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's arm reached out and touched asteroid Bennu. Dubbed a Touch-And-Go (TAG) sampling event, the 30 centimeter wide sampling head (TAGSAM) appears to crush some of the rocks in this snapshot. The close-up scene was recorded by the spacecraft's SamCam some 321 million kilometers from planet Earth, just after surface contact. One second later, the spacecraft fired nitrogen gas from a bottle intended to blow a substantial amount of Bennu's regolith into the sampling head, collecting the loose surface material. Data show the spacecraft spent approximately 5 more seconds in contact with Bennu's Nightingale sample site and then performed its back-away burn. Timelapse frames from SamCam reveal the aftermath.","tagging, bennu, careful, approach, boulder-strewn, surface, osiris-rex, spacecraft, reached, touched, asteroid, dubbed, touch-and-go, sampling, event, centimeter, wide, head, tagsam, appears, crush, rock, snapshot, close-up, scene, recorded, samcam, kilometer, planet, earth, contact, second, fired, nitrogen, bottle, intended, substantial, amount, regolith, collecting, loose, material, data, show, spent, nightingale, sample, site, performed, back-away, burn, timelapse, frame, reveal, aftermath"
Supernova in NGC 2525,"Big, beautiful, barred spiral galaxy NGC 2525 lies 70 million light-years from the Milky Way. It shines in Earth's night sky within the boundaries of the southern constellation Puppis. About 60,000 light-years across, its spiral arms lined with dark dust clouds, massive blue stars, and pinkish starforming regions wind through this gorgeous Hubble Space Telescope snapshot. Spotted on the outskirts of NGC 2525 in January 2018, supernova SN 2018gv is the brightest star in the frame at the lower left. In time-lapse, a year long series of Hubble observations followed the stellar explosion, the nuclear detonation of a white dwarf star triggered by accreting material from a companion star, as it slowly faded from view. Identified as a Type Ia supernova, its brightness is considered a cosmic standard candle. Type Ia supernovae are used to measure distances to galaxies and determine the expansion rate of the Universe.","supernova, beautiful, barred, spiral, galaxy, light-year, milky, shine, earth, night, boundary, southern, constellation, puppis, lined, dark, dust, cloud, massive, blue, star, pinkish, starforming, region, gorgeous, hubble, space, telescope, snapshot, spotted, january, brightest, frame, left, time-lapse, year, long, series, observation, followed, stellar, explosion, nuclear, detonation, white, dwarf, triggered, accreting, material, companion, faded, view, identified, type, brightness, considered, cosmic, standard, candle, used, measure, distance, determine, expansion, rate, universe"
Globular Star Cluster 47 Tuc,"Globular star cluster 47 Tucanae is a jewel of the southern sky. Also known as NGC 104, it roams the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy along with some 200 other globular star clusters. The second brightest globular cluster (after Omega Centauri) as seen from planet Earth, it lies about 13,000 light-years away and can be spotted naked-eye close on the sky to the Small Magellanic Cloud in the constellation of the Toucan. The dense cluster is made up of hundreds of thousands of stars in a volume only about 120 light-years across. Red giant stars on the outskirts of the cluster are easy to pick out as yellowish stars in this sharp telescopic portrait. Tightly packed globular cluster 47 Tuc is also home to a star with the closest known orbit around a black hole.","globular, star, cluster, tucanae, jewel, southern, known, roams, halo, milky, galaxy, second, brightest, omega, centauri, seen, planet, earth, light-year, spotted, naked-eye, close, small, magellanic, cloud, constellation, toucan, dense, made, thousand, volume, giant, outskirt, easy, pick, yellowish, sharp, telescopic, portrait, packed, home, closest, orbit, black, hole"
Dark Matter in a Simulated Universe,"Is our universe haunted?  It might look that way on this dark matter map.  The gravity of unseen dark matter is the leading explanation for why galaxies rotate so fast, why galaxies orbit clusters so fast, why gravitational lenses so strongly deflect light, and why visible matter is distributed as it is both in the local universe and on the cosmic microwave background.  The featured image from the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium previous Space Show Dark Universe highlights one example of how pervasive dark matter might haunt our universe.  In this frame from a detailed computer simulation, complex filaments of dark matter, shown in black, are strewn about the universe like spider webs, while the relatively rare clumps of familiar baryonic matter are colored orange. These simulations are good statistical matches to astronomical observations.  In what is perhaps a scarier turn of events, dark matter -- although quite strange and in an unknown form -- is no longer thought to be the strangest source of gravity in the universe. That honor now falls to dark energy, a more uniform source of repulsive gravity that seems to now dominate the expansion of the entire universe.","dark, matter, simulated, universe, haunted, look, gravity, unseen, leading, explanation, galaxy, rotate, fast, orbit, cluster, gravitational, lens, deflect, light, visible, distributed, local, cosmic, microwave, background, featured, image, american, museum, natural, history, hayden, planetarium, previous, space, show, highlight, example, pervasive, haunt, frame, detailed, computer, simulation, complex, filament, shown, black, strewn, spider, rare, clump, familiar, baryonic, colored, orange, good, statistical, match, astronomical, observation, turn, event, strange, unknown, form, longer, thought, strangest, source, honor, fall, energy, uniform, repulsive, seems, dominate, expansion, entire"
Reflections of the Ghost Nebula,"Do any shapes seem to jump out at you from this interstellar field of stars and dust?  The jeweled expanse, filled with faint, starlight-reflecting clouds, drifts through the night in the royal constellation of Cepheus. Far from your own neighborhood on planet Earth, these ghostly apparitions lurk along the plane of the Milky Way at the edge of the Cepheus Flare molecular cloud complex some 1,200 light-years away. Over two light-years across and brighter than the other spooky chimeras, VdB 141 or Sh2-136 is also known as the Ghost Nebula, seen at toward the bottom of the featured image.

Venusian Volcano Imagined,"What would an erupting volcano on Venus look like? Evidence of currently active volcanoes on Venus was announced earlier this year with the unexplained warmth of regions thought to contain only ancient volcanoes.  Although large scale images of Venus have been taken with radar, thick sulfuric acid clouds would inhibit the taking of optical light vistas. Nevertheless, an artist's reconstruction of a Venusian volcano erupting is featured. Volcanoes could play an important role in a life cycle on Venus as they could push chemical foods into the cooler upper atmosphere where hungry microbes might float.  Pictured, the plume from an erupting volcano billows upwards, while a vast lava field covers part of the hot and cracked surface of Earth's overheated twin.  The possibility of airborne microbial Venusians is certainly exciting, but currently controversial.

NGC 6357: The Lobster Nebula,"Why is the Lobster Nebula forming some of the most massive stars known? No one is yet sure.  Cataloged as NGC 6357, the Lobster Nebula houses the open star cluster Pismis 24 near its center -- a home to unusually bright and massive stars.  The overall blue glow near the inner star forming region results from the emission of ionized hydrogen gas.   The surrounding nebula, featured here, holds a complex tapestry of gas, dark dust, stars still forming, and newly born stars.  The intricate patterns are caused by complex interactions between interstellar winds, radiation pressures, magnetic fields, and gravity.  NGC 6357 spans about 400 light years and lies about 8,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Scorpion.","lobster, nebula, forming, massive, star, known, sure, cataloged, house, open, cluster, pismis, center, home, bright, overall, blue, glow, inner, region, result, emission, ionized, hydrogen, surrounding, featured, hold, complex, tapestry, dark, dust, born, intricate, pattern, caused, interaction, interstellar, wind, radiation, pressure, magnetic, field, gravity, span, light, year, constellation, scorpion"

The interstellar scene lies within the dusty expanse of reflection nebula IC 2118 in the constellation Orion, the Hunter. IC 2118 is about 800 light-years from your neighborhood, close to bright bluish star Rigel at Orion's foot. Often identified as the Witch Head nebula for its appearance in a wider field of view it now rises before the witching hour.

Fear and Dread: The Moons of Mars,"On Halloween fear and dread will stalk your night skies, also known as Phobos and Deimos the moons of Mars. The 2020 opposition of Mars was on October 13, so the Red Planet will still rise shortly before sunset. Near Halloween's Full Moon on the sky, its strange yellowish glow will outshine other stars throughout the night. But the two tiny Martian moons are very faint and in close orbits, making them hard to spot, even with a small telescope. You can find them in this carefully annotated composite view though. The overexposed planet's glare is reduced and orbital paths for inner moon Phobos and outer moon Deimos are overlayed on digitally combined images captured on October 6. The diminutive moons of Mars were discovered in August of 1877 by astronomer Asaph Hall at the US Naval Observatory using the Great Equatorial 26-inch Alvan Clark refractor.","fear, dread, moon, halloween, stalk, night, known, phobos, deimos, opposition, planet, rise, sunset, full, strange, yellowish, glow, outshine, star, tiny, martian, faint, close, orbit, making, hard, spot, small, telescope, find, annotated, composite, view, overexposed, glare, reduced, orbital, path, inner, overlayed, combined, image, captured, diminutive, discovered, august, astronomer, hall, naval, observatory, using, great, equatorial, 26-inch, alvan, clark, refractor"

In the Center of the Trifid Nebula,"What's happening at the center of the Trifid Nebula? Three prominent dust lanes that give the Trifid its name all come together. Mountains of opaque dust appear near the bottom, while other dark filaments of dust are visible threaded throughout the nebula.  A single massive star visible near the center causes much of the Trifid's glow.  The Trifid, cataloged as M20, is only about 300,000 years old, making it among the youngest emission nebulas known.  The star forming nebula lies about 9,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius). The region pictured here spans about 10 light years.  The featured image is a composite with luminance taken from an image by the 8.2-m ground-based Subaru Telescope, detail provided by the 2.4-m orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, color data provided by Martin Pugh and image assembly and processing provided by Robert Gendler.

Half Sun with Prominence,"What's happening to the Sun? Clearly, the Sun's lower half is hidden behind a thick cloud.  Averaging over the entire Earth, clouds block the Sun about 2/3rds of the time, although much less over many land locations. On the Sun's upper right is a prominence of magnetically levitating hot gas. The prominence might seem small but it could easily envelop our  Earth and persist for over a month.  The featured image is a combination of two exposures, one optimizing the cloud and prominence, and the other optimizing the Sun's texture.  Both were taken about an hour apart with the same camera and from the same location in Lynnwood, Washington, USA.  The shaggy texture derives from the Sun's chromosphere, an atmospheric layer that stands out in the specifically exposed color.  The uniformity of the texture shows the surface to be relatively calm, indicative of a Sun just past the solar minimum in its 11-year cycle. In the years ahead, the Sun will progress toward a more active epoch where sunspots, prominences, and ultimately auroras on Earth will be more common: solar maximum.

Tagging Bennu: The Movie,"This is what it looks like to punch an asteroid. Last month, NASA's robotic spacecraft OSIRIS-REx descended toward, thumped into, and then quickly moved away from the small near-Earth asteroid 101955 Bennu.  The featured video depicts the Touch-And-Go (TAG) sampling event over a three-hour period.  As the movie begins, the automated probe approaches the 500-meter, diamond-shaped, space rock as it rotates noticeably below. About 20 seconds into the video, Nightingale comes into view -- a touchdown area chosen to be relatively flat and devoid of large boulders that could damage the spaceship.  At 34 seconds, the shadow of OSIRIS-REx's sampling arm suddenly comes into view, while very soon thereafter rocks and gravel fly from the arm's abrupt hard impact.  The wily spacecraft was able to capture and successfully stow some of Bennu's ejecta for return to Earth for a detailed analysis.  This long return is scheduled to start in 2021 March with arrival back on Earth in 2023 September. If the return sample does successfully reach Earth, it will be scrutinized for organic compounds that might have seeded a young Earth, rare or unusual elements and minerals, and clues about the early history of our Solar System.","tagging, bennu, movie, look, punch, asteroid, last, month, nasa, robotic, spacecraft, osiris-rex, descended, thumped, moved, small, near-earth, featured, video, depicts, touch-and-go, sampling, event, three-hour, period, begin, automated, probe, approach, 500-meter, diamond-shaped, space, rock, rotates, second, nightingale, come, view, touchdown, area, chosen, flat, devoid, large, boulder, damage, spaceship, shadow, gravel, abrupt, hard, impact, able, capture, stow, ejecta, return, earth, detailed, analysis, scheduled, start, march, arrival, september, sample, reach, scrutinized, organic, compound, seeded, young, rare, unusual, element, mineral, clue, early, history, solar, system"
Fifty Gravitational Wave Events Illustrated,"Over fifty gravitational wave events have now been detected. These events mark the distant, violent collisions of two black holes, a black hole and a neutron star, or two neutron stars.  Most of the 50 events were detected in 2019 by the LIGO gravitational wave detectors in the USA and the VIRGO detector in Europe.  In the featured illustration summarizing the masses of the first 50 events, blue dots indicate higher-mass black holes while orange dots denote lower-mass neutron stars. Astrophysicists are currently uncertain, though, about the nature of events marked in white involving masses that appear to be in the middle -- between two and five solar masses.  The night sky in optical light is dominated by nearby and bright planets and stars that have been known since the dawn of humanity. In contrast, the sky in gravitational waves is dominated by distant and dark black holes  that have only been known about for less than five years.  This contrast is enlightening -- understanding the gravitational wave sky is already reshaping humanity's knowledge not only of star birth and death across the universe, but properties of the universe itself.","fifty, gravitational, wave, event, illustrated, detected, mark, distant, violent, collision, black, hole, neutron, star, ligo, detector, virgo, europe, featured, illustration, summarizing, mass, blue, indicate, higher-mass, orange, denote, lower-mass, astrophysicist, uncertain, nature, marked, white, involving, appear, solar, night, optical, light, dominated, bright, planet, known, dawn, humanity, contrast, dark, year, enlightening, understanding, reshaping, knowledge, birth, death, universe, property"
North of Orion's Belt,"Bright stars, interstellar clouds of dust and glowing nebulae fill this cosmic scene, a skyscape just north of Orion's belt. Close to the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, the wide field view spans just under 5 degrees or about 10 full moons on the sky. Striking bluish M78, a reflection nebula, is at the lower right. M78's tint is due to dust preferentially reflecting the blue light of hot, young stars. In colorful contrast, the red swath of glowing hydrogen gas streaming through the center is part of the region's faint but extensive emission nebula known as Barnard's Loop. At upper left, a dark dust cloud forms a prominent silhouette cataloged as LDN 1622. While M78 and the complex Barnard's Loop are some 1,500 light-years away, LDN 1622 is likely to be much closer, only about 500 light-years distant from our fair planet Earth.","north, orion, belt, bright, star, interstellar, cloud, dust, glowing, nebula, fill, cosmic, scene, skyscape, plane, milky, galaxy, wide, field, view, span, degree, full, moon, striking, bluish, reflection, lower, right, tint, reflecting, blue, light, young, colorful, contrast, swath, hydrogen, streaming, center, part, region, faint, extensive, emission, known, barnard, loop, upper, left, dark, form, prominent, silhouette, cataloged, complex, light-year, much, closer, distant, fair, planet, earth"
Moon over ISS,"Completing one orbit of our fair planet in 90 minutes the International Space Station can easily be spotted by eye as a very bright star moving through the night sky. Have you seen it? The next time you do, you will have recognized the location of over 20 years of continuous human presence in space. In fact, the Expedition 1 crew to the ISS docked with the orbital outpost some 400 kilometers above the Earth on November 2, 2000. No telescope is required to spot the ISS flashing through the night. But this telescopic field of view does reveal remarkable details of the space station captured as it transited the waning gibbous moon on November 3, just one day after the space age milestone. The well-timed telescopic snapshot also contains the location of another inspirational human achievement. About 400,000 kilometers away, the Apollo 11 landing site on the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Tranquility is to the right of the ISS silhouette.","moon, completing, orbit, fair, planet, minute, international, space, station, spotted, bright, star, moving, night, seen, next, time, recognized, location, year, continuous, human, presence, fact, expedition, crew, docked, orbital, kilometer, earth, november, telescope, required, spot, flashing, telescopic, field, view, reveal, remarkable, detail, captured, transited, waning, gibbous, well-timed, snapshot, contains, inspirational, achievement, apollo, landing, site, dark, smooth, lunar, tranquility, silhouette"
The Hercules Cluster of Galaxies,"These are galaxies of the Hercules Cluster, an archipelago of island universes a mere 500 million light-years away. Also known as Abell 2151, this cluster is loaded with gas and dust rich, star-forming spiral galaxies but has relatively few elliptical galaxies, which lack gas and dust and the associated newborn stars. The colors in this deep composite image clearly show the star forming galaxies with a blue tint and galaxies with older stellar populations with a yellowish cast. The sharp picture spans about 1/2 degree across the cluster center, corresponding to over 4 million light-years at the cluster's estimated distance. Diffraction spikes around brighter foreground stars in our own Milky Way galaxy are produced by the imaging telescope's mirror support vanes. In the cosmic vista many galaxies seem to be colliding or merging while others seem distorted - clear evidence that cluster galaxies commonly interact. In fact, the Hercules Cluster itself may be seen as the result of ongoing mergers of smaller galaxy clusters and is thought to be similar to young galaxy clusters in the much more distant, early Universe.","hercules, cluster, galaxy, island, universe, light-year, known, loaded, dust, rich, star-forming, spiral, elliptical, lack, associated, newborn, star, color, deep, composite, image, show, forming, blue, tint, older, stellar, population, yellowish, cast, sharp, picture, span, degree, center, corresponding, estimated, distance, diffraction, spike, brighter, foreground, milky, produced, imaging, telescope, mirror, support, vane, cosmic, vista, many, seem, colliding, merging, others, distorted, clear, evidence, interact, fact, seen, result, ongoing, merger, smaller, thought, similar, young, much, distant, early"
Martian Moon Phobos from Mars Express,"Why is Phobos so dark?  Phobos, the largest and innermost of two Martian moons, is the darkest moon in the entire Solar System.  Its unusual orbit and color indicate that it may be a captured asteroid composed of a mixture of ice and dark rock.  The featured picture of Phobos near the limb of Mars was captured in 2010 by the robot spacecraft Mars Express currently orbiting Mars.  Phobos is a heavily cratered and barren moon, with its largest crater located on the far side.  From images like this, Phobos has been determined to be covered by perhaps a meter of loose dust.  Phobos orbits so close to Mars that from some places it would appear to rise and set twice a day, but from other places it would not be visible at all.  Phobos' orbit around Mars is continually decaying -- it will likely break up with pieces crashing to the Martian surface in about 50 million years.","martian, moon, phobos, express, dark, largest, innermost, darkest, entire, solar, system, unusual, orbit, color, indicate, captured, asteroid, composed, mixture, rock, featured, picture, limb, robot, spacecraft, orbiting, cratered, barren, crater, located, side, image, determined, covered, loose, dust, close, place, appear, rise, visible, decaying, likely, break, piece, crashing, surface, year"
In Green Company: Aurora over Norway,"Raise your arms if you see an aurora. With those instructions, two nights went by with, well, clouds -- mostly. On the third night of returning to same peaks, though, the sky not only cleared up but lit up with a spectacular auroral display. Arms went high in the air, patience and experience paid off, and the creative featured image was captured as a composite from three separate exposures. The setting is a summit of the Austnesfjorden fjord close to the town of Svolvear on the Lofoten islands in northern Norway. The time was early 2014. Although our Sun has just passed the solar minimum of its 11-year cycle, surface activity should pick up over the next few years with the promise of triggering more spectacular auroras on Earth.","green, company, aurora, raise, instruction, night, went, cloud, third, returning, peak, cleared, spectacular, auroral, display, high, patience, experience, paid, creative, featured, image, captured, composite, separate, exposure, setting, summit, fjord, town, svolvear, lofoten, island, northern, norway, time, passed, solar, minimum, 11-year, cycle, surface, activity, pick, next, year, promise, triggering, earth"
The Central Soul Nebula Without Stars,"This cosmic close-up looks deep inside the Soul Nebula. The dark and brooding dust clouds near the top, outlined by bright ridges of glowing gas, are cataloged as IC 1871. About 25 light-years across, the telescopic field of view spans only a small part of the much larger Heart and Soul nebulae. At an estimated distance of 6,500 light-years the star-forming complex lies within the Perseus spiral arm of our  Milky Way Galaxy, seen in planet Earth's skies toward the constellation Cassiopeia. An example of triggered star formation, the dense star-forming clouds in the Soul Nebula are themselves sculpted by the intense winds and radiation of the region's massive young stars.

Colors of the Moon,"What color is the Moon? It depends on the night.  Outside of the Earth's atmosphere, the dark Moon, which shines by reflected sunlight, appears a magnificently brown-tinged gray.  Viewed from inside the Earth's atmosphere, though, the moon can appear quite different.  The featured image highlights a collection of apparent colors of the full moon documented by one astrophotographer over 10 years from different locations across Italy. A red or yellow colored moon usually indicates a moon seen near the horizon.  There, some of the blue light has been scattered away by a long path through the Earth's atmosphere, sometimes laden with fine dust. A blue-colored moon is more rare and can indicate a moon seen through an atmosphere carrying larger dust particles.  What created the purple moon is unclear -- it may be a combination of several effects.  The last image captures the total lunar eclipse of 2018 July -- where the moon, in Earth's shadow, appeared a faint red -- due to light refracted through air around the Earth. The next full moon will occur at the end of this month (moon-th) and is known in some cultures as the Beaver Moon.","color, moon, depends, night, earth, atmosphere, dark, shine, reflected, sunlight, appears, brown-tinged, gray, viewed, appear, different, featured, image, highlight, collection, apparent, full, documented, astrophotographer, year, location, italy, yellow, colored, indicates, seen, horizon, blue, light, scattered, long, path, laden, fine, dust, blue-colored, rare, indicate, carrying, larger, particle, created, purple, unclear, combination, several, effect, last, capture, total, lunar, eclipse, july, shadow, appeared, faint, refracted, next, occur, month, moon-th, known, culture, beaver"
Comet ATLAS and Orion's Belt,"With its closest approach to planet Earth scheduled for November 14, this Comet ATLAS (C/2020 M3) was discovered just this summer, another comet found by the NASA funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System. It won't get as bright as Comet NEOWISE but it can still be spotted using binoculars, as it currently sweeps through the familiar constellation of Orion. This telephoto field from November 8, blends exposures registered on the comet with exposures registered on Orion's stars. It creates an effectively deep skyview that shows colors and details you can't quite see though, even in binoculars. The comet's telltale greenish coma is toward the upper left, above Orion's three belt stars lined-up across the frame below center. You'll also probably spot the Orion Nebula, and famous Horsehead Nebula in the stunning field of view. Of course one of Orion's belt stars is nearly 2,000 light-years away.

The Tarantula Zone,"The Tarantula Nebula, also known as 30 Doradus, is more than a thousand light-years in diameter, a giant star forming region within nearby satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. About 180 thousand light-years away, it's the largest, most violent star forming region known in the whole Local Group of galaxies. The cosmic arachnid sprawls across the top of this spectacular view, composed with narrowband filter data centered on emission from ionized hydrogen and oxygen atoms. Within the Tarantula (NGC 2070), intense radiation, stellar winds and supernova shocks from the central young cluster of massive stars, cataloged as R136, energize the nebular glow and shape the spidery filaments. Around the Tarantula are other star forming regions with young star clusters, filaments, and blown-out bubble-shaped clouds. In fact, the frame includes the site of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A, right of center. The rich field of view spans about 2 degrees or 4 full moons, in the southern constellation Dorado. But were the Tarantula Nebula closer, say 1,500 light-years distant like the local star forming Orion Nebula, it would take up half the sky.","tarantula, nebula, known, doradus, light-year, diameter, giant, star, forming, region, nearby, satellite, galaxy, large, magellanic, cloud, largest, violent, whole, local, group, cosmic, arachnid, sprawl, spectacular, view, composed, filter, data, centered, emission, ionized, hydrogen, oxygen, atom, intense, radiation, stellar, wind, supernova, shock, central, young, cluster, massive, cataloged, r136, energize, nebular, glow, shape, spidery, filament, blown-out, bubble-shaped, fact, frame, includes, site, closest, modern, time, center, rich, field, span, degree, full, moon, southern, constellation, dorado, closer, distant, orion, take, half"
"Venus, Mercury, and the Waning Moon","Yesterday, early morning risers around planet Earth were treated to a waning Moon low in the east as the sky grew bright before dawn. From the Island of Ortigia, Syracuse, Sicily, Italy this simple snapshot found the slender sunlit crescent just before sunrise. Never wandering far from the Sun in Earth's sky, inner planets Venus and Mercury shared the calm seaside view. Also in the frame, right of the line-up of Luna and planets, is bright star Spica, alpha star of the constellation Virgo and one of the 20 brightest stars in Earth's night. Tomorrow the Moon will be New. The dark lunar disk means mostly dark nights for planet Earth in the coming week and a good chance to watch the annual Leonid Meteor Shower.","venus, mercury, waning, moon, yesterday, early, morning, riser, planet, earth, treated, east, grew, bright, dawn, island, ortigia, syracuse, italy, simple, snapshot, found, slender, sunlit, crescent, sunrise, wandering, inner, shared, calm, seaside, view, right, line-up, luna, star, spica, alpha, constellation, brightest, night, tomorrow, dark, lunar, disk, mean, coming, week, good, chance, watch, annual, leonid, meteor, shower"
Edge-On Galaxy NGC 5866,"Why is this galaxy so thin?  Many disk galaxies are just as thin as NGC 5866, pictured here, but are not seen edge-on from our vantage point.  One galaxy that is situated edge-on is our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Classified as a lenticular galaxy, NGC 5866 has numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, while many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue.  The blue disk of young stars can be seen extending past the dust in the extremely thin galactic plane, while the bulge in the disk center appears tinged more orange from the older and redder stars that likely exist there. Although similar in mass to our Milky Way Galaxy, light takes about 60,000 years to cross NGC 5866, about 30 percent less than light takes to cross our own Galaxy. In general, many disk galaxies are very thin because the gas that formed them collided with itself as it rotated about the gravitational center. Galaxy NGC 5866 lies about 44 million light years distant toward the constellation of the Dragon (Draco).

Light and Glory over Crete,"The month was July, the place was the Greek island of Crete, and the sky was spectacular. Of course there were the usual stars like Polaris, Vega, and Antares -- and that common asterism everyone knows: the Big Dipper. But this sky was just getting started.  The band of the Milky Way Galaxy stunned as it arched across the night like a bridge made of stars and dust but dotted with red nebula like candy. The planets Saturn and Jupiter were so bright you wanted to stop people on the beach and point them out. The air glowed like a rainbow -- but what really grabbed the glory was a comet. Just above the northern horizon, Comet NEOWISE spread its tails like nothing you had ever seen before or might ever see again.  Staring in amazement, there was only one thing to do: take a picture.

A Glowing STEVE and the Milky Way,"What's creating these long glowing streaks in the sky? No one is sure.  Known as Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancements (STEVEs), these luminous light-purple sky ribbons may resemble regular auroras, but recent research reveals significant differences. A STEVE's great length and unusual colors, when measured precisely, indicate that it may be related to a subauroral ion drift (SAID), a supersonic river of hot atmospheric ions thought previously to be invisible.  Some STEVEs are now also thought to be accompanied by green picket fence structures, a series of sky slats that can appear outside of the main auroral oval that does not involve much glowing nitrogen. The featured wide-angle composite image shows a STEVE in a dark sky above Childs Lake, Manitoba, Canada in 2017, crossing in front of the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.","glowing, steve, milky, creating, streak, sure, known, strong, thermal, emission, velocity, enhancement, steves, luminous, light-purple, ribbon, resemble, regular, aurora, recent, research, reveals, significant, difference, great, length, unusual, color, measured, indicate, related, subauroral, drift, said, supersonic, river, atmospheric, thought, invisible, accompanied, green, picket, fence, structure, series, slat, outside, main, auroral, oval, involve, nitrogen, featured, wide-angle, composite, image, show, dark, child, lake, manitoba, canada, crossing, front, central, band, galaxy"
A Double Star Cluster in Perseus,"Most star clusters are singularly impressive.  Open clusters NGC 869 and NGC 884, however, could be considered doubly impressive.  Also known as ""h and chi Persei"", this unusual double cluster, shown above, is bright enough to be seen from a dark location without even binoculars.  Although their discovery surely predates recorded history, the Greek astronomer Hipparchus notably cataloged the double cluster.  The clusters are over 7,000 light years distant toward the constellation of Perseus, but are separated by only hundreds of light years. In addition to being physically close together, the clusters' ages based on their individual stars are similar - evidence that both clusters were likely a product of the same star-forming region.","double, star, cluster, perseus, impressive, open, considered, known, persei, unusual, shown, bright, seen, dark, location, binoculars, discovery, predates, recorded, history, greek, astronomer, hipparchus, cataloged, light, year, distant, constellation, separated, addition, based, individual, similar, evidence, likely, product, star-forming, region"
Crew-1 Mission Launch Streak,"Leaving planet Earth for a moment, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket arced into the early evening sky last Sunday at 7:27 pm EST from Kennedy Space Center's Launch Complex 39A. This 3 minute 20 second exposure traces the launch streak as seen over watery reflections from Port Canaveral, about 15 miles south of the launch. The rocket carried four astronauts en route to the International Space Station on the first flight of a NASA-certified commercial human spacecraft system. Dubbed Resilience, the astronauts' Crew Dragon spacecraft successfully docked with the orbital outpost one day later, on Monday, November 16. At the conclusion of their six-month stay on the ISS, the Crew-1 astronauts will use their spacecraft to return to Earth.

Global Map: Mars at Opposition,"This may be the best global Mars map made with a telescope based on planet Earth. The image data were captured by a team of observers over six long nights at the Pic du Midi mountaintop observatory between October 8 and November 1, when the fourth rock from the Sun had not wandered far from its 2020 opposition and its biggest and brightest appearance in Earth's night sky. The large telescope used, 1 meter in diameter with a 17 meter focal length, was also used in support of NASA's Apollo lunar landing missions. After about 30 hours of processing, the data were combined to produced this remarkably sharp projected view of the martian surface extending to about 45 degrees northern latitude. The image data have also been mapped onto rotating sphere and rotating stereo views. Fans of Mars can easily pick out their favorite markings on the Red Planet by eyeing a labeled version of this global map of Mars.","global, opposition, best, made, telescope, based, planet, earth, image, data, captured, team, long, night, midi, mountaintop, observatory, fourth, rock, wandered, biggest, brightest, appearance, large, used, meter, diameter, focal, length, support, nasa, apollo, lunar, landing, mission, hour, processing, combined, produced, sharp, projected, view, martian, surface, extending, degree, northern, latitude, mapped, rotating, sphere, stereo, pick, favorite, marking, eyeing, labeled, version"

Dark Molecular Cloud Barnard 68,"Where did all the stars go?  What used to be considered a hole in the sky is now known to astronomers as a dark molecular cloud.  Here, a high concentration of dust and molecular gas absorb practically all the visible light emitted from background stars.  The eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors of molecular clouds some of the coldest and most isolated places in the universe.  One of the most notable of these dark absorption nebulae is a cloud toward the constellation Ophiuchus known as Barnard 68, pictured here.  That no stars are visible in the center indicates that Barnard 68 is relatively nearby, with measurements placing it about 500 light-years away and half a light-year across.  It is not known exactly how molecular clouds like Barnard 68 form, but it is known that these clouds are themselves likely places for new stars to form. In fact, Barnard 68 itself has been found likely to collapse and form a new star system. It is possible to look right through the cloud in infrared light.","dark, molecular, cloud, barnard, star, used, considered, hole, known, astronomer, high, concentration, dust, absorb, visible, light, emitted, surroundings, help, make, interior, coldest, isolated, place, universe, notable, absorption, constellation, pictured, center, indicates, nearby, measurement, placing, light-year, half, form, likely, fact, found, collapse, system, possible, look, right, infrared"
A Jupiter Vista from Juno,"Why do colorful cloud bands encircle Jupiter? Jupiter's top atmospheric layer is divided into light zones and dark belts that go all the way around the giant planet. It is high horizontal winds -- in excess of 300 kilometers per hour -- that cause the zones to spread out planet-wide. What causes these strong winds remains a topic of research.  Replenished by upwelling gas, zonal bands are thought to include relatively opaque clouds of ammonia and water that block light from lower and darker atmospheric levels.  One light-colored zone is shown in great detail in the featured vista taken by the robotic Juno spacecraft in 2017.  Jupiter's atmosphere is mostly clear and colorless hydrogen and helium, gases that are not thought to contribute to the gold and brown colors.  What compounds create these colors is another active topic of research -- but is hypothesized to involve small amounts of sunlight-altered sulfur and carbon.  Many discoveries have been made from Juno's data, including that water composes an unexpectedly high 0.25 percent of upper-level cloud molecules near Jupiter's equator, a finding important not only for understanding Jovian currents but for the history of water in the entire Solar System.","jupiter, vista, juno, colorful, cloud, band, encircle, atmospheric, layer, divided, light, zone, dark, belt, giant, planet, high, horizontal, wind, excess, kilometer, hour, cause, spread, planet-wide, strong, remains, topic, research, replenished, upwelling, zonal, thought, include, opaque, ammonia, water, block, lower, darker, level, light-colored, shown, great, detail, featured, taken, robotic, spacecraft, clear, colorless, hydrogen, helium, contribute, gold, brown, color, compound, create, active, hypothesized, small, amount, sunlight-altered, sulfur, carbon, many, discovery, made, data, including, composes, percent, upper-level, molecule, equator, finding, important, understanding, jovian, current, history, entire, solar, system"
The Helix Nebula from CFHT,"Will our Sun look like this one day?  The Helix Nebula is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The outer gasses of the star expelled into space appear from our vantage point as if we are looking down a helix. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The Helix Nebula, given a technical designation of NGC 7293, lies about 700 light-years away towards the constellation of the Water Bearer (Aquarius) and spans about 2.5 light-years. The featured picture was taken with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii, USA.

Andromeda over Patagonia,"How far can you see?  The Andromeda Galaxy at 2.5 million light years away is the most distant object easily seen with your unaided eye.  Most other apparent denizens of the night sky -- stars, clusters, and nebulae -- typically range from a few hundred to a few thousand light-years away and lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Given its distance, light from Andromeda is likely also the oldest light that you can see.  Also known as M31, the Andromeda Galaxy dominates the center of the featured zoomed image, taken from the dunes of Bahía Creek, Patagonia, in southern Argentina.  The image is a combination of 45 background images with one foreground image -- all taken with the same camera and from the same location within 90 minutes.  M110, a satellite galaxy of Andromenda is visible just below and to the left of M31's core. As cool as it may be to see this neighboring galaxy to our Milky Way with your own eyes, long duration camera exposures can pick up many faint and breathtaking details.

The Great Turkey Nebula,"Surprisingly reminiscent of The Great Nebula in Orion, The Great Turkey Nebula spans this creative field of view.  Of course if it were the Orion Nebula it would be our closest large stellar nursery, found at the edge of a large molecular cloud a mere 1,500 light-years away. Also known as M42, the Orion Nebula is visible to the eye as the middle ""star"" in the sword of Orion the Hunter, a constellation now rising in planet Earth's evening skies. Stellar winds from clusters of newborn stars scattered throughout the Orion Nebula sculpt its ridges and cavities seen in familiar in telescopic images.

Chang'e 5 Mission Launch,"This Long March-5 rocket blasted off from the Wenchang launch site in southernmost Hainan province on Tuesday November 24, at 4:30 am Beijing Time, carrying China's Chang'e-5 mission to the Moon. The lunar landing mission is named for the ancient Chinese goddess of the moon. Its goal is to collect about 2 kilograms (4.4 pounds) of lunar material from the surface and return it to planet Earth, the first robotic sample return mission to the Moon since the Soviet Union's Luna 24 mission in 1976. The complex Chang'e-5 mission landing target is in the Oceanus Procellarum (Ocean of Storms). The smooth volcanic plain was also visited by the Apollo 12 mission in 1969.

Verona Rupes: Tallest Known Cliff in the Solar System,"Could you survive a jump off the tallest cliff in the Solar System? Quite possibly.  Verona Rupes on Uranus' moon Miranda is estimated to be 20 kilometers deep -- ten times the depth of the Earth's Grand Canyon.   Given Miranda's low gravity, it would take about 12 minutes for a thrill-seeking adventurer to fall from the top, reaching the bottom at the speed of a racecar -- about 200 kilometers per hour.   Even so, the fall might be survivable given proper airbag protection.  The featured image of Verona Rupes was captured by the passing Voyager 2 robotic spacecraft in 1986.  How the giant cliff was created remains unknown, but is possibly related to a large impact or tectonic surface motion.","verona, rupes, tallest, known, cliff, solar, system, survive, jump, uranus, moon, miranda, estimated, kilometer, deep, time, depth, earth, grand, canyon, given, gravity, take, minute, thrill-seeking, adventurer, fall, reaching, bottom, speed, racecar, hour, survivable, proper, airbag, protection, featured, image, captured, passing, voyager, robotic, spacecraft, giant, created, remains, unknown, related, large, impact, tectonic, surface, motion"
Cygnus Without Stars,"The sky is filled with faintly glowing gas, though it can take a sensitive camera and telescope to see it. For example, this twelve-degree-wide view of the northern part of the constellation Cygnus reveals a complex array of cosmic clouds of gas along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy. The featured mosaic of telescopic images was recorded through two filters: an H-alpha filter that transmits only visible red light from glowing hydrogen atoms, and a blue filter that transmits primarily light emitted by the slight amount of energized oxygen. Therefore, in this 18-hour exposure image, blue areas are hotter than red.  Further digital processing has removed the myriad of point-like Milky Way stars from the scene. Recognizable bright nebulas include NGC 7000 (North America Nebula), and IC 5070 (Pelican Nebula) on the left with IC 1318 (Butterfly Nebula) and NGC 6888 (Crescent Nebula) on the right -- but others can be found throughout the wide field.","cygnus, star, filled, glowing, take, sensitive, camera, telescope, example, twelve-degree-wide, view, northern, part, constellation, reveals, complex, array, cosmic, cloud, plane, milky, galaxy, featured, mosaic, telescopic, image, recorded, filter, h-alpha, transmits, visible, light, hydrogen, atom, blue, emitted, slight, amount, energized, oxygen, 18-hour, exposure, area, hotter, digital, processing, removed, myriad, point-like, scene, recognizable, bright, nebula, include, north, america, pelican, left, butterfly, crescent, others, found, wide, field"
NGC 346: Star Forming Cluster in the SMC,"Are stars still forming in the Milky Way's satellite galaxies?  Found among the Small Magellanic Cloud's (SMC's) clusters and nebulas, NGC 346 is a star forming region about 200 light-years across, pictured here in the center of a Hubble Space Telescope image. A satellite galaxy of the Milky Way, the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC) is a wonder of the southern sky, a mere 210,000 light-years distant in the constellation of the Toucan (Tucana). Exploring NGC 346, astronomers have identified a population of embryonic stars strung along the dark, intersecting dust lanes visible here on the right. Still collapsing within their natal clouds, the stellar infants' light is reddened by the intervening dust. Toward the top of the frame is another star cluster with intrinsically older and redder stars. A small, irregular galaxy, the SMC itself represents a type of galaxy more common in the early Universe. These small galaxies, though, are thought to be building blocks for the larger galaxies present today.

Eye of Moon,"Who's watching whom?  The featured image of the Moon through a gap in a wall of rock may appear like a giant eye looking back at you.  Although, in late October, it took only a single exposure to capture this visual double, it also took a lot of  planning.  The photographic goal was achieved by precise timing -- needed for a nearly full moon to appear through the eye-shaped arch, by precise locating -- needed for the angular size of the Moon to fit iconically inside the rock arch, and by good luck -- needed for a clear sky and for the entire scheme to work. The seemingly coincidental juxtaposition was actually engineered with the help of three smartphone apps.  The pictured sandstone arch, carved by erosion, is millions of years old and just one of thousands of natural rock arches that have been found in Arches National Park near Moab, Utah, USA.  Contrastingly, the pictured Moon can be found up in the sky from just about anywhere on Earth, about half the time.","moon, watching, featured, image, wall, rock, appear, giant, looking, late, october, took, single, exposure, capture, visual, double, planning, photographic, goal, achieved, precise, timing, needed, full, eye-shaped, arch, locating, angular, size, inside, good, luck, clear, entire, scheme, work, coincidental, juxtaposition, engineered, help, smartphone, apps, pictured, sandstone, carved, erosion, year, thousand, natural, found, national, park, moab, utah, earth, half, time"
The Antennae Galaxies in Collision,"Sixty million light-years away toward the southerly constellation Corvus, these two large galaxies are colliding. The cosmic train wreck captured in stunning detail in this Hubble Space Telescope snapshot takes hundreds of millions of years to play out. Cataloged as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, the galaxies' individual stars don't often collide though. Their large clouds of molecular gas and dust do, triggering furious episodes of star formation near the center of the wreckage. New star clusters and interstellar matter are jumbled and flung far from the scene of the accident by gravitational forces. This Hubble close-up frame is about 50,000 light-years across at the estimated distance of the colliding galaxies. In wider-field views their suggestive visual appearance, with extended structures arcing for hundreds of thousands of light-years, gives the galaxy pair its popular name, The Antennae Galaxies.","antenna, galaxy, collision, light-year, southerly, constellation, corvus, large, colliding, cosmic, train, wreck, captured, stunning, detail, hubble, space, telescope, snapshot, take, year, play, cataloged, individual, star, collide, cloud, molecular, dust, triggering, furious, episode, formation, center, wreckage, cluster, interstellar, matter, jumbled, scene, accident, gravitational, force, close-up, frame, estimated, distance, wider-field, view, suggestive, visual, appearance, extended, structure, arcing, thousand, give, pair, popular, name"
Curly Spiral Galaxy M63,"A bright spiral galaxy of the northern sky, Messier 63 is nearby, about 30 million light-years distant toward the loyal constellation Canes Venatici. Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our own Milky Way. Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy, while this exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint, arcing star streams far into the galaxy's halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63.

M16: Pillars of Star Creation,"These dark pillars may look destructive, but they are creating stars.  This pillar-capturing image of the inside of the Eagle Nebula, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in 1995, shows evaporating gaseous globules (EGGs) emerging from pillars of molecular hydrogen gas and dust.  The giant pillars are light years in length and are so dense that interior gas contracts gravitationally to form stars.  At each pillars' end, the intense radiation of bright young stars causes low density material to boil away, leaving stellar nurseries of dense EGGs exposed.  The Eagle Nebula, associated with the open star cluster M16, lies about 7000 light years away.  The pillars of creation have been imaged more recently in infrared light by Hubble, NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope, and ESA's Herschel Space Observatory -- showing new detail.

Mammatus Clouds over Mount Rushmore,"What's that below those strange clouds? Presidents. If you look closely, you may recognize the heads of four former US Presidents carved into famous Mount Rushmore in South Dakota, USA.  More obvious in the featured image are the unusual mammatus clouds that passed briefly overhead. Both were captured together by a surprised tourist with a quick camera in early September. Unlike normal flat-bottomed clouds which form when moist and calm air plateaus rise and cool, bumpy mammatus clouds form as icy and turbulent air pockets sink and heat up.  Such turbulent air is frequently accompanied by a thunderstorm.  Each mammatus lobe spans about one kilometer. The greater mountain is known to native Lakota Sioux as Six Grandfathers, deities responsible for the directions north, south, east, west, up, and down.","mammatus, cloud, mount, rushmore, strange, president, look, recognize, head, former, carved, famous, south, dakota, obvious, featured, image, unusual, passed, briefly, overhead, captured, surprised, tourist, quick, camera, early, september, normal, flat-bottomed, form, moist, calm, plateau, rise, cool, bumpy, turbulent, pocket, sink, heat, accompanied, thunderstorm, lobe, span, kilometer, greater, mountain, known, native, lakota, sioux, grandfather, deity, responsible, direction, north, east, west"
Great Conjunction over Sicilian Lighthouse,"Don’t miss the coming great conjunction. In just under two weeks, the two largest planets in our Solar System will angularly pass so close together in Earth's sky that the Moon would easily be able to cover them both simultaneously.  This pending planetary passage -- on December 21 -- will be the closest since 1623.  Jupiter and Saturn will remain noticeably bright and can already be seen together toward the southwest just after sunset.  Soon after dusk is the best time to see them -- because they set below the horizon soon after.  In mid-November, the Jovian giants were imaged together here about three degrees apart -- and slowly closing. The featured image, including a crescent moon, captured the dynamic duo beyond the Cape Murro di Porco Lighthouse in Syracuse, Sicily, Italy.","great, conjunction, sicilian, lighthouse, miss, coming, week, largest, planet, solar, system, earth, moon, able, cover, pending, planetary, passage, december, closest, jupiter, saturn, remain, bright, seen, southwest, sunset, best, time, horizon, mid-november, jovian, giant, imaged, degree, closing, featured, image, including, crescent, captured, dynamic, cape, murro, porco, syracuse, italy"
Arecibo Telescope Collapse,"This was one great scientific instrument. Starting in 1963, the 305-meters across Arecibo Telescope in Puerto Rico USA reigned as the largest single-dish radio telescope in the world for over 50 years. Among numerous firsts and milestones, data from Arecibo has been used to measure the spin of Mercury, map the surface of Venus, discover the first planets outside of our Solar System, verify the existence of gravitational radiation, search for extraterrestrial intelligence, and, reportedly, locate hidden military radar by tracking their reflections from the Moon.  In the process of being decommissioned, the Arecibo Telescope suffered a catastrophic structural collapse early this month, as seen in the featured composite video.","telescope, collapse, great, scientific, instrument, starting, 305-meters, puerto, rico, reigned, largest, single-dish, radio, world, year, numerous, first, milestone, data, arecibo, used, measure, spin, mercury, surface, venus, discover, planet, solar, system, verify, existence, gravitational, radiation, search, extraterrestrial, intelligence, locate, hidden, military, radar, tracking, reflection, moon, process, decommissioned, suffered, catastrophic, structural, early, month, seen, featured, composite, video"
Simeis 147: Supernova Remnant,"It's easy to get lost following the intricate looping filaments in this detailed image of supernova remnant Simeis 147. Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240 it goes by the popular nickname, the Spaghetti Nebula. Seen toward the boundary of the constellations Taurus and Auriga, it covers nearly 3 degrees or 6 full moons on the sky. That's about 150 light-years at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years. This composite includes image data taken through narrow-band filters where reddish emission from ionized hydrogen atoms and doubly ionized oxygen atoms in faint blue-green hues trace the shocked, glowing gas. The supernova remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000 years, meaning light from the massive stellar explosion first reached Earth 40,000 years ago. But the expanding remnant is not the only aftermath. The cosmic catastrophe also left behind a spinning neutron star or pulsar, all that remains of the original star's core.","simeis, supernova, remnant, easy, lost, following, intricate, looping, filament, detailed, image, cataloged, sharpless, 2-240, popular, nickname, spaghetti, nebula, seen, boundary, constellation, taurus, auriga, degree, full, moon, light-year, stellar, debris, cloud, estimated, distance, composite, includes, data, taken, narrow-band, filter, reddish, emission, ionized, hydrogen, atom, oxygen, faint, blue-green, trace, shocked, glowing, year, meaning, light, massive, explosion, reached, earth, expanding, aftermath, cosmic, catastrophe, left, spinning, neutron, star, pulsar, remains, original, core"
Messier Craters in Stereo,"Many bright nebulae and star clusters in planet Earth's sky are associated with the name of astronomer Charles Messier from his famous 18th century catalog. His name is also given to these two large and remarkable craters on the Moon. Standouts in the dark, smooth lunar Sea of Fertility or Mare Fecunditatis, Messier (left) and Messier A have dimensions of 15 by 8 and 16 by 11 kilometers respectively. Their elongated shapes are explained by the extremely shallow-angle trajectory followed by an impactor, moving left to right, that gouged out the craters. The shallow impact also resulted in two bright rays of material extending along the surface to the right, beyond the picture. Intended to be viewed with red/blue glasses (red for the left eye), this striking stereo picture of the crater pair was recently created from high resolution scans of two images (AS11-42-6304, AS11-42-6305) taken during the Apollo 11 mission to the Moon.","messier, crater, stereo, many, bright, nebula, star, cluster, planet, earth, associated, name, astronomer, charles, famous, 18th, century, catalog, given, large, remarkable, moon, standouts, dark, smooth, lunar, fertility, mare, fecunditatis, left, dimension, kilometer, elongated, shape, explained, shallow-angle, trajectory, followed, impactor, moving, right, gouged, shallow, impact, resulted, material, extending, picture, intended, viewed, red/blue, glass, striking, pair, created, high, resolution, scan, image, as11-42-6304, as11-42-6305, taken, apollo, mission"
Saturn and Jupiter in Summer 2020,"During this northern summer Saturn and Jupiter were both near opposition, opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky. Their paired retrograde motion, seen about every 20 years, is followed from 19 June through 28 August in this panoramic composite as they wander together between the stars in western Capricornus and eastern Sagittarius. But this December's skies find them drawing even closer together. Jupiter and Saturn are now close, bright celestial beacons in the west after sunset. On solstice day December 21 they will reach their magnificent 20 year Great Conjunction. Then the two largest worlds in the Solar System will appear in Earth's sky separated by only about 1/5 the apparent diameter of a Full Moon.","saturn, jupiter, summer, northern, opposition, opposite, planet, earth, paired, retrograde, motion, seen, year, followed, june, august, panoramic, composite, wander, star, western, capricornus, eastern, sagittarius, december, find, drawing, close, bright, celestial, beacon, west, sunset, solstice, reach, magnificent, great, conjunction, largest, world, solar, system, appear, separated, apparent, diameter, full, moon"
Geminid Meteors over Xinglong Observatory,"Where do Geminid meteors come from?  In terms of location on the sky, as the featured image composite beautifully demonstrates, the sand-sized bits of rock that create the streaks of the Geminids meteor shower appear to flow out from the constellation of Gemini. In terms of parent body, Solar System trajectories point to the asteroid 3200 Phaethon -- but this results in a bit of a mystery since that unusual object appears mostly dormant.  Perhaps, 3200 Phaethon undergoes greater dust-liberating events than we know. Over 50 meteors including a bright fireball were captured during the peak of the 2015 Geminids Meteor Shower streaking above Xinglong Observatory in China.  The Geminids of December are one of the most predictable and active meteor showers.  This year's Geminids peak tonight and should be particularly good because, in part, the nearly new Moon will only rise toward dawn and so not brighten the sky.","geminid, meteor, xinglong, observatory, come, term, location, featured, image, composite, demonstrates, sand-sized, rock, create, streak, geminids, shower, appear, flow, constellation, gemini, parent, body, solar, system, trajectory, point, asteroid, phaethon, result, mystery, unusual, object, appears, dormant, undergoes, greater, dust-liberating, event, know, including, bright, fireball, captured, peak, streaking, china, december, predictable, active, year, tonight, good, part, moon, rise, dawn, brighten"
Capsule Returns from Asteroid Ryugu,"The streak across the sky is a capsule returning from an asteroid. It returned earlier this month from the near-Earth asteroid 162173 Ryugu carrying small rocks and dust from its surface.  The canister was released by its mothership, Japan's Hayabusa2, a mission that visited Ryugu in 2018, harvested a surface sample in 2019, and zoomed back past Earth.  The jettisoned return capsule deployed a parachute and landed in rural Australia. A similar mission, NASA's OSIRIS- REx, recently captured rocks and dust from a similar asteroid, Bennu, and is scheduled to return its surface sample to Earth in 2023. Analyses of compounds from these asteroids holds promise to give humanity new insights about the early Solar System and new clues about how water and organic matter came to be on Earth.

Great Conjunction: Saturn and Jupiter Converge,"It's happening. Saturn and Jupiter are moving closer and will soon appear in almost exactly the same direction.  Coincidentally, on the night of the December solstice -- the longest night of the year in the north and the longest day in the south -- the long-awaited Great Conjunction will occur. Then, about six days from now, Saturn and Jupiter will be right next to each other -- as they are every 20 years. But this juxtaposition is not just any Great Conjunction -- it will be the closest since 1623 because the two planetary giants will pass only 1/10th of a degree from each other -- well less than the apparent diameter of a full moon.  In the next few days a crescent moon will also pass a few degrees away from the converging planets and give a preliminary opportunity for iconic photos.  The featured illustration shows the approach of Saturn and Jupiter during November and December over the French Alps.

Sonified: The Matter of the Bullet Cluster,"What's the matter with the Bullet Cluster? This massive cluster of galaxies (1E 0657-558) creates gravitational lens distortions of background galaxies in a way that has been interpreted as strong evidence for the leading theory: that dark matter exists within. Different analyses, though, indicate that a less popular alternative -- modifying gravity-- could explain cluster dynamics without dark matter, and provide a more likely progenitor scenario as well. Currently, the two scientific hypotheses are competing to explain the observations: it's invisible matter versus amended gravity. The duel is dramatic as a clear Bullet-proof example of dark matter would shatter the simplicity of modified gravity theories.  The featured sonified image is a Hubble/Chandra/Magellan composite with red depicting the X-rays emitted by hot gas, and blue depicting the suggested separated dark matter distribution.  The sonification assigns low tones to dark matter, mid-range frequencies to visible light, and high tones to X-rays.  The battle over the matter in the Bullet cluster is likely to continue as more observations, computer simulations, and analyses are completed.

Gemini's Meteors,"Taken over the course of an hour shortly after local midnight on December 13, 35 exposures were used to create this postcard from Earth. The composited night scene spans dark skies above the snowy Italian Dolomites during our fair planet's annual Geminid meteor shower. Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major and the brightest star in the night, is grazed by a meteor streak on the right. The Praesepe star cluster, also known as M44 or the Beehive cluster, itself contains about a thousand stars but appears as a smudge of light far above the southern alpine peaks near the top. The shower's radiant is off the top of the frame though, near Castor and Pollux the twin stars of Gemini. The radiant effect is due to perspective as the parallel meteor tracks appear to converge in the distance. As Earth sweeps through the dust trail of asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the dust that creates Gemini's meteors enters Earth's atmosphere traveling at about 22 kilometers per second.

Diamond in the Sky,"When the shadow of the Moon raced across planet Earth's southern hemisphere on December 14, sky watchers along the shadow's dark central path were treated to the only total solar eclipse of 2020. During the New Moon's shadow play this glistening diamond ring was seen for a moment, even in cloudy skies. Known as the diamond ring effect, the transient spectacle actually happens twice. Just before and immediately after totality, a thin sliver of solar disk visible behind the Moon's edge creates the appearance of a shiny jewel set in a dark ring. This dramatic snapshot from the path of totality in northern Patagonia, Argentina captures this eclipse's second diamond ring, along with striking solar prominences lofted beyond the edge of the Moon's silhouette.","diamond, shadow, moon, raced, planet, earth, southern, hemisphere, december, watcher, dark, central, path, treated, total, solar, eclipse, play, glistening, ring, seen, moment, cloudy, known, effect, transient, spectacle, happens, twice, totality, thin, sliver, disk, visible, edge, creates, appearance, shiny, jewel, dramatic, snapshot, northern, patagonia, argentina, capture, second, striking, prominence, lofted, silhouette"
Conjunction after Sunset,"How close will Jupiter and Saturn be at their Great Conjunction? Consider this beautiful triple conjunction of Moon, Jupiter and Saturn captured through clouds in the wintry twilight. The telephoto view looks toward the western horizon and the Alborz Mountains in Iran after sunset on December 17. The celestial gathering makes it easy to see Jupiter and fainter Saturn are separated on that date by roughly the diameter of the waxing crescent Moon. On the day of their Great Conjunction, solstice day December 21, Jupiter and Saturn may seem to nearly merge though. In their closest conjunction in 400 years they will be separated on the sky by only about 1/5 the apparent diameter of the Moon. By then the two largest worlds in the Solar System and their moons will be sharing the same field of view in telescopes around planet Earth.","conjunction, sunset, close, jupiter, saturn, great, consider, beautiful, triple, moon, captured, cloud, wintry, twilight, telephoto, view, look, western, horizon, alborz, mountain, iran, december, celestial, gathering, make, easy, fainter, separated, date, waxing, crescent, solstice, seem, closest, year, apparent, diameter, largest, world, solar, system, sharing, field, telescope, planet, earth"
A Volcanic Great Conjunction,"Where can I see the Great Conjunction?  Near where the Sun just set. Directionally, this close passing of Jupiter and Saturn will be toward the southwest. Since the planetary pair, the Sun, and the Earth are nearly in a geometric straight line, the planets will be seen to set just where the Sun had set -- from every location on Earth.  When can I see the Great Conjunction?  Just after sunset.  Since the two planets are so near the Sun directionally, they always appear in the sky near the Sun, but can best be seen when the Earth blocks the Sun but not the planets: sunset.  Soon thereafter, Jupiter and Saturn will also set, so don't be late!   Is tomorrow night the only night that I can see the Great Conjunction?  Tomorrow night the jovian giants will appear the closest, but on any night over the next few days they will appear unusually close. Technically, the closest pass happens on 21 December at 18:20 UTC.    Will there be an erupting volcano on the horizon near the Great Conjunction? Yes, for example if you live in Guatemala where the featured image was taken. Otherwise, generally, no.  In the featured image captured last week, Jupiter and Saturn are visible toward the right, just above a tree, and bathed in the diffuse glow of zodiacal light.

Solstice: Sunrises Around the Year,"Does the Sun always rise in the same direction?  No.  As the months change, the direction toward the rising Sun changes, too.  The featured image shows the direction of sunrise every month during 2019 as seen from near the city of Amman, Jordan.  The camera in the image is always facing due east, with north toward the left and south toward the right.  Although the Sun always rises in the east in general, it rises furthest to the south of east on the December solstice, and furthest north of east on the June solstice. Today is the December solstice, the day of least sunlight in the Northern Hemisphere and of most sunlight in the Southern Hemisphere.  In many countries, the December Solstice is considered an official change in season: for example the first day of winter in the North.  Solar heating and stored energy in the Earth's surface and atmosphere are near their lowest during winter, making the winter months usually the coldest of the year.  On the brighter side, in the north, daylight hours will now increase every day from until June.

Trifid Pillars and Jets,"Dust pillars are like interstellar mountains.  They survive because they are more dense than their surroundings, but they are being slowly eroded away by a hostile environment.  Visible in the featured picture is the end of a huge gas and dust pillar in the Trifid Nebula (M20), punctuated by a smaller pillar pointing up and an unusual jet pointing to the left.  Many of the dots are newly formed low-mass stars. A star near the small pillar's end is slowly being stripped of its accreting gas by radiation from a tremendously brighter star situated off the top of the image.  The jet extends nearly a light-year and would not be visible without external illumination.  As gas and dust evaporate from the pillars, the hidden stellar source of this jet will likely be uncovered, possibly over the next 20,000 years.

Jupiter Meets Saturn: A Red Spotted Great Conjunction,"It was time for their close-up. Two days ago  Jupiter and Saturn passed a tenth of a degree from each other in what is known a Great Conjunction. Although the two planets pass each other on the sky every 20 years, this was the closest pass in nearly four centuries.  Taken early in day of the Great Conjunction, the featured multiple-exposure combination captures not only both giant planets in a single frame, but also Jupiter's four largest moons (left to right) Callisto, Ganymede, Io, and Europa --  and Saturn's largest moon Titan. If you look very closely, the clear Chilescope image even captures Jupiter's Great Red Spot.

Portrait of NGC 1055,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 1055 is a dominant member of a small galaxy group a mere 60 million light-years away toward the aquatically intimidating constellation Cetus. Seen edge-on, the island universe spans over 100,000 light-years, a little larger than our own Milky Way galaxy. The colorful, spiky stars decorating this cosmic portrait of NGC 1055 are in the foreground, well within the Milky Way. But the telltale pinkish star forming regions are scattered through winding dust lanes along the distant galaxy's thin disk. With a smattering of even more distant background galaxies, the deep image also reveals a boxy halo that extends far above and below the central bluge and disk of NGC 1055. The halo itself is laced with faint, narrow structures, and could represent the mixed and spread out debris from a satellite galaxy disrupted by the larger spiral some 10 billion years ago.","portrait, beautiful, spiral, galaxy, dominant, member, small, group, mere, light-year, intimidating, constellation, cetus, seen, edge-on, island, universe, span, little, larger, milky, colorful, spiky, star, decorating, cosmic, foreground, telltale, pinkish, forming, region, scattered, winding, dust, lane, distant, thin, disk, smattering, background, deep, image, reveals, boxy, halo, extends, central, bluge, laced, faint, narrow, structure, represent, mixed, spread, satellite, disrupted, year"

Those familiar stars of the constellation of the Hunter are caught above the trees in this colorful night skyscape. Not a star at all but still visible to eye, the Great Nebula of Orion shines below the Hunter's belt stars. The camera's exposure reveals the stellar nursery's faint pinkish glow. Betelgeuse, giant star at Orion's shoulder, has the color of warm and cozy terrestrial lighting, but so does another familiar stellar giant, Aldebaran.

"Fox Fur, Unicorn, and Christmas Tree","Clouds of glowing hydrogen gas fill this colorful skyscape in the faint but fanciful constellation Monoceros, the Unicorn. A star forming region cataloged as NGC 2264, the complex jumble of cosmic gas and dust is about 2,700 light-years distant and mixes reddish emission nebulae excited by energetic light from newborn stars with dark interstellar dust clouds. Where the otherwise obscuring dust clouds lie close to the hot, young stars they also reflect starlight, forming blue reflection nebulae. The telescopic image spans about 1.5 degrees or 3 full moons, covering nearly 80 light-years at the distance of NGC 2264. Its cast of cosmic characters includes the the Fox Fur Nebula, whose dusty, convoluted pelt lies left of center, bright variable star S Monocerotis immersed in the blue-tinted haze near center, and the Cone Nebula pointing in from the right side of the frame. Of course, the stars of NGC 2264 are also known as the Christmas Tree star cluster. The triangular tree shape is seen on its side here. Traced by brighter stars it has its apex at the Cone Nebula.

Cosmic Latte: The Average Color of the Universe,"What color is the universe?  More precisely, if the entire sky were smeared out, what color would the final mix be?  This whimsical question came up when trying to determine what stars are commonplace in nearby galaxies. The answer, depicted above, is a conditionally perceived shade of beige. In computer parlance: #FFF8E7.  To determine this, astronomers computationally averaged the light emitted by one of the larger samples of galaxies analyzed: the 200,000 galaxies of the 2dF survey.  The resulting cosmic spectrum has some emission in all parts of the electromagnetic spectrum, but a single perceived composite color.  This color has become much less blue over the past 10 billion years, indicating that redder stars are becoming more prevalent.  In a contest to better name the color, notable entries included skyvory, univeige, and the winner: cosmic latte.

M16: Inside the Eagle Nebula,"From afar, the whole thing looks like an Eagle.  A closer look at the Eagle Nebula, however, shows the bright region is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust.  Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appears where a whole open cluster of stars is being formed.  In this cavity tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gas remain where stars are still forming.  Already visible are several young bright blue stars whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the remaining filaments and walls of gas and dust.  The Eagle emission nebula, tagged M16, lies about 6500 light years away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Serpent (Serpens).

Earth During a Total Solar Eclipse,"What does the Earth look like during a total solar eclipse? It appears dark in the region where people see the eclipse, because that's where the shadow of the Moon falls. The shadow spot rapidly shoots across the Earth at nearly 2,000 kilometers per hour, darkening locations in its path -- typically for only a few minutes -- before moving on. The featured video shows the Earth during the total solar eclipse earlier this month.  The time-lapse sequence, taken from a geostationary satellite, starts with the Earth below showing night but the sun soon rises at the lower right.  Clouds shift as day breaks over the blue planet. Suddenly the circular shadow of the Moon appears on the left and moves rapidly across South America, disappearing on the lower right.  The video ends as nightfall begins again.

Jupiter and Saturn Great Conjunction: The Movie,"Yes, but have you seen a movie of Jupiter and Saturn's Great Conjunction? The featured time-lapse video was composed from a series of images taken from Thailand and shows the two giant planets as they angularly passed about a tenth of a degree from each other.  The first Great Conjunction sequence shows a relative close up over five days with moons and cloud bands easily visible, followed by a second video sequence, zoomed out, over 9 days.  Even though Jupiter and Saturn appeared to pass unusually close together on the sky on December 21, 2020, in actuality they were still nearly a billion kilometers apart.  The two gas giants are destined for similar meet ups every 19.86 years.  However, they had not come this close, angularly, for the past 397 years, and will not again for another 60 years.  If you're willing to wait until the year 7541, though, you can see Jupiter  pass directly in front of Saturn.

Trail of the Returner,"Familiar stars of a northern winter's night shine in this night skyview, taken near Zhangye, Gansu, China and the border with Inner Mongolia. During the early hours of December 17 Orion is near center in the single exposure that captures a fireball streaking across the sky, almost as bright as yellowish Mars shining on the right. Splitting Gemini's twin bright stars Castor and Pollux near the top of the frame, the fireball's trail and timing are consistent with the second skipping atmospheric entry of the Chang'e 5 mission's returner capsule. The returner capsule was successfully recovered after landing in Inner Mongolia, planet Earth with about 2 kilograms of lunar material on board. The lunar sample is thought to contain relatively young material collected near the Mons Rumker region of the Moon's Oceanus Procellarum. Launched on November 23 UT, China's Chang'e 5 mission is the first lunar sample return mission since the Soviet Union’s Luna 24 mission in 1976.","trail, returner, familiar, star, northern, winter, night, shine, skyview, taken, zhangye, gansu, china, border, inner, mongolia, hour, december, orion, center, single, exposure, capture, fireball, streaking, bright, yellowish, shining, right, splitting, gemini, twin, castor, pollux, frame, timing, consistent, second, skipping, atmospheric, entry, chang, mission, capsule, recovered, landing, planet, earth, kilogram, lunar, material, board, sample, thought, contain, young, collected, rumker, region, moon, oceanus, procellarum, launched, return, soviet, union, luna"
Galaxies and the South Celestial Pole,"The South Celestial Pole is easy to spot in star trail images of the southern sky. The extension of Earth's axis of rotation to the south, it's at the center of all the southern star trail arcs. In this starry panorama streching about 60 degrees across deep southern skies the South Celestial Pole is somewhere near the middle though, flanked by bright galaxies and southern celestial gems. Across the top of the frame are the stars and nebulae along the plane of our own Milky Way Galaxy. Gamma Crucis, a yellowish giant star heads the Southern Cross near top center, with the dark expanse of the Coalsack nebula tucked under the cross arm on the left. Eta Carinae and the reddish glow of the Great Carina Nebula shine along the galactic plane near the right edge. At the bottom are the Large and Small Magellanic clouds, external galaxies in their own right and satellites of the mighty Milky Way. A line from Gamma Crucis through the blue star at the bottom of the southern cross, Alpha Crucis, points toward the South Celestial Pole, but where exactly is it?

21st Century Wet Collodion Moon,"In the mid 19th century, one of the first photographic technologies used to record the lunar surface was the wet-plate collodion process, notably employed by British astronomer Warren De la Rue. To capture an image, a thick, transparent mixture was used to coat a glass plate, sensitized with silver nitrate, exposed at the telescope, and then developed to create a negative image on the plate. To maintain photographic sensitivity, the entire process, from coating to exposure to developing, had to be completed before the plate dried, in a span of about 10 to 15 minutes. This modern version of a wet-plate collodion image celebrates lunar photography's early days, reproducing the process using modern chemicals to coat a glass plate from a 21st century hardware store. Captured last November 28 with an 8x10 view camera and backyard telescope, it faithfully records large craters, bright rays, and dark, smooth mare of the waxing gibbous Moon. Subsequently digitized, the image on the plate was 8.5 centimeters in diameter and exposed while tracking for 2 minutes. The wet plate's effective photographic sensitivity was about ISO 1.  In your smart phone, the camera sensor probably has a photographic sensitivity range of ISO 100 to 6400 (and needs to be kept dry ...).","21st, century, collodion, moon, 19th, first, photographic, technology, used, record, lunar, surface, wet-plate, process, employed, british, astronomer, warren, capture, image, thick, transparent, mixture, coat, glass, plate, sensitized, nitrate, exposed, telescope, developed, create, negative, maintain, sensitivity, entire, coating, exposure, developing, completed, dried, span, minute, modern, version, celebrates, photography, early, reproducing, using, chemical, hardware, store, captured, last, november, view, camera, large, crater, bright, dark, mare, waxing, gibbous, digitized, centimeter, diameter, tracking, effective, smart, phone, sensor, range, need, kept"
A Phoenix Aurora over Iceland,"All of the other aurora watchers had gone home. By 3:30 am in Iceland, on a quiet September night, much of that night's auroras had died down. Suddenly, unexpectedly, a new burst of particles streamed down from space, lighting up the Earth's atmosphere once again. This time, surprisingly, pareidoliacally, the night lit up with an  amazing shape reminiscent of a giant phoenix. With camera equipment at the ready, two quick sky images were taken, followed immediately by a third of the land.  The mountain in the background is Helgafell, while the small foreground river is called Kaldá, both located about 30 kilometers north of Iceland's capital Reykjavík. Seasoned skywatchers will note that just above the mountain, toward the left, is the constellation of Orion, while the Pleiades star cluster is also visible just above the frame center.  The 2016 aurora, which lasted only a minute and was soon gone forever --  would possibly be dismissed as an fanciful fable -- were it not captured in the featured, digitally-composed, image mosaic.

"Sprite Lightning at 100,000 Frames Per Second","What causes sprite lightning? Mysterious bursts of light in the sky that momentarily resemble gigantic jellyfish have been recorded for over 30 years, but apart from a general association with positive cloud-to-ground lightning, their root cause remains unknown. Some thunderstorms have them -- most don't.  Recently, however, high speed videos are better detailing how sprites actually develop.  The featured video, captured in mid-2019, is fast enough -- at about 100,000 frames per second -- to time-resolve several sprite ""bombs"" dropping and developing into the multi-pronged streamers that appear on still images. Unfortunately, the visual clues provided by videos like these do not fully resolve the sprite origins mystery. High speed vidoes do indicate to some researchers, though, that sprites are more likely to occur when plasma irregularities exist in the upper atmosphere.

The Small Cloud of Magellan,"What is the Small Magellanic Cloud? It has turned out to be a galaxy.  People who have wondered about this little fuzzy patch in the southern sky included Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan and his crew, who had plenty of time to study the unfamiliar night sky of the south during the first circumnavigation of planet Earth in the early 1500s. As a result, two celestial wonders easily visible for southern hemisphere skygazers are now known in Western culture as the Clouds of Magellan. Within the past 100 years, research has shown that these cosmic clouds are dwarf irregular galaxies, satellites of our larger spiral Milky Way Galaxy. The Small Magellanic Cloud actually spans 15,000 light-years or so and contains several hundred million stars. About 210,000 light-years away in the constellation of the Tucan (Tucana), it is more distant than other known Milky Way satellite galaxies, including the Sagittarius Dwarf galaxy and the Large Magellanic Cloud. This sharp image also includes the foreground globular star cluster 47 Tucanae on the right.","small, cloud, magellan, magellanic, turned, galaxy, people, wondered, little, fuzzy, patch, southern, included, portuguese, navigator, ferdinand, crew, plenty, time, study, unfamiliar, night, south, first, circumnavigation, planet, earth, result, celestial, wonder, visible, hemisphere, skygazers, known, western, culture, past, year, research, shown, cosmic, dwarf, irregular, satellite, larger, spiral, milky, span, light-year, contains, several, star, constellation, tucan, tucana, distant, including, sagittarius, large, sharp, image, includes, foreground, globular, cluster, tucanae, right"
Striped Sand Dunes on Mars,"Why are these sand dunes on Mars striped?  No one is sure.  The featured image shows striped dunes in Kunowsky Crater on Mars, photographed recently with the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter’s HiRISE Camera.  Many Martian dunes are known to be covered unevenly with carbon dioxide (dry ice) frost, creating patterns of light and dark areas.  Carbon dioxide doesn’t melt, but sublimates, turning directly into a gas. Carbon dioxide is also a greenhouse material even as a solid, so it can trap heat under the ice and sublimate from the bottom up, causing geyser-like eruptions.  During Martian spring, these eruptions can cause a pattern of dark defrosting spots, where the darker sand is exposed.  The featured image, though, was taken during Martian autumn, when the weather is getting colder – making these stripes particularly puzzling.  One hypothesis is that they are caused by cracks in the ice that form from weaker eruptions or thermal stress as part of the day-night cycle, but research continues.  Watching these dunes and others through more Martian seasons may give us more clues to solve this mystery.","striped, sand, dune, sure, featured, image, show, kunowsky, crater, photographed, reconnaissance, orbiter, hirise, camera, many, martian, known, covered, unevenly, carbon, dioxide, frost, creating, pattern, light, dark, area, melt, sublimate, turning, greenhouse, material, solid, trap, heat, bottom, causing, geyser-like, eruption, spring, cause, defrosting, spot, darker, exposed, taken, autumn, weather, getting, colder, making, stripe, puzzling, hypothesis, caused, crack, form, weaker, thermal, stress, part, day-night, cycle, research, continues, watching, others, season, give, clue, solve, mystery"
Total Solar Eclipse 2020,"Along a narrow path crossing southern South America through Chile and Argentina, the final New Moon of 2020 moved in front of the Sun on December 14 in the year's only total solar eclipse. Within about 2 days of perigee, the closest point in its elliptical orbit, the New Moon's surface is faintly lit by earthshine in this dramatic composite view. The image is a processed composite of 55 calibrated exposures ranging from 1/640 to 3 seconds. Covering a large range in brightness during totality, it reveals the dim lunar surface and faint background stars, along with planet-sized prominences at the Sun's edge, an enormous coronal mass ejection, and sweeping coronal structures normally hidden in the Sun's glare. Look closely for an ill-fated sungrazing Kreutz family comet (C/2020 X3 SOHO) approaching from the lower left, at about the 7 o'clock position. In 2021 eclipse chasers will see an annular solar eclipse coming up on June 10. They'll have to wait until December 4 for the only total solar eclipse in 2021 though.

NGC 1365: Majestic Island Universe,"Barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 is truly a majestic island universe some 200,000 light-years across. Located a mere 60 million light-years away toward the chemical constellation Fornax, NGC 1365 is a dominant member of the well-studied Fornax Cluster of galaxies. This impressively sharp color image shows the intense, reddish star forming regions near the ends of central bar and along the spiral arms, with details of the obscuring dust lanes cutting across the galaxy's bright core. At the core lies a supermassive black hole. Astronomers think NGC 1365's prominent bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, drawing gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the central black hole.","majestic, island, universe, barred, spiral, galaxy, light-year, located, chemical, constellation, fornax, dominant, member, well-studied, cluster, sharp, color, image, show, intense, reddish, star, forming, region, central, detail, obscuring, dust, lane, cutting, bright, core, supermassive, black, hole, astronomer, think, prominent, play, crucial, role, evolution, drawing, star-forming, maelstrom, feeding, material"
Titan: Moon over Saturn,"Like Earth's moon, Saturn's largest moon Titan is locked in synchronous rotation. This mosaic of images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft in May of 2012 shows its anti-Saturn side, the side always facing away from the ringed gas giant. The only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, Titan is the only solar system world besides Earth known to have standing bodies of liquid on its surface and an earthlike cycle of liquid rain and evaporation. Its high altitude layer of atmospheric haze is evident in the Cassini view of the 5,000 kilometer diameter moon over Saturn's rings and cloud tops. Near center is the dark dune-filled region known as Shangri-La.

Star Cluster R136 Breaks Out,"In the center of nearby star-forming region lies a huge cluster containing some of the largest, hottest, and most massive stars known. These stars, known collectively as star cluster R136, part of the Tarantula Nebula, were captured in the featured image in visible light in 2009 through the Hubble Space Telescope. Gas and dust clouds in the Tarantula Nebula, have been sculpted into elongated shapes by powerful winds and ultraviolet radiation from these hot cluster stars.

Moon Phases in 2021,"What will the Moon phase be on your birthday this year?  It is hard to predict because the Moon's appearance changes nightly.  As the Moon orbits the Earth, the half illuminated by the Sun first becomes increasingly visible, then decreasingly visible. The featured video animates images taken by NASA's Moon-orbiting Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to show all 12 lunations that appear this year, 2021. A single lunation describes one full cycle of our Moon, including all of its phases. A full lunation takes about 29.5 days, just under a month (moon-th). As each lunation progresses, sunlight reflects from the Moon at different angles, and so illuminates different features differently.  During all of this, of course, the Moon always keeps the same face toward the Earth. What is less apparent night-to-night is that the Moon's apparent size changes slightly, and that a slight wobble called a libration occurs as the Moon progresses along its elliptical orbit.

A Historic Brazilian Constellation,"The night sky is filled with stories. Cultures throughout history have projected some of their most enduring legends onto the stars above. Generations of people see these stellar constellations, hear the associated stories, and pass them down. Featured here is the perhaps unfamiliar constellation of the Old Man, long recognized by the Tupi peoples native to regions of South America now known as Brazil.  The Old Man, in more modern vernacular, may be composed of the Hyades star cluster as his head and the belt of Orion as part of one leg.  Tupi folklore relates that the other leg was cut off by his unhappy wife, causing it to end at the orange star now known as Betelgeuse. The Pleiades star cluster, on the far left, can be interpreted as a head feather. In the featured image, the hobbled Old Man is mirrored by a person posing in the foreground.  Folklore of the night sky is important for many reasons, including that it records cultural heritage and documents the universality of human intelligence and imagination.

Arches Across an Arctic Sky,"What are these two giant arches across the sky? Perhaps the more familiar one, on the left, is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy. This grand disk of stars and nebulas here appears to encircle much of the southern sky. Visible below the stellar arch is the rusty-orange planet Mars and the extended Andromeda galaxy. For a few minutes during this cold arctic night, a second giant arch appeared to the right, encircling part of the northern sky: an aurora. Auroras are much closer than stars as they are composed of glowing air high in Earth's atmosphere.  Visible outside the green auroral arch is the group of stars popularly known as the Big Dipper.

Aurora Slathers Up the Sky,"Like salsa verde on your favorite burrito, a green aurora slathers up the sky in this 2017 June 25 snapshot from the International Space Station. About 400 kilometers (250 miles) above Earth, the orbiting station is itself within the upper realm of the auroral displays. Aurorae have the signature colors of excited molecules and atoms at the low densities found at extreme altitudes. Emission from atomic oxygen dominates this view. The tantalizing glow is green at lower altitudes, but rarer reddish bands extend above the space station's horizon. The orbital scene was captured while passing over a point south and east of Australia, with stars above the horizon at the right belonging to the constellation Canis Major, Orion's big dog.

A Plutonian Landscape,"This shadowy landscape of majestic mountains and icy plains stretches toward the horizon on a small, distant world. It was captured from a range of about 18,000 kilometers when New Horizons looked back toward Pluto, 15 minutes after the spacecraft's closest approach on July 14, 2015. The dramatic, low-angle, near-twilight scene follows rugged mountains formally known as Norgay Montes from foreground left, and Hillary Montes along the horizon, giving way to smooth Sputnik Planum at right. Layers of Pluto's tenuous atmosphere are also revealed in the backlit view.

The Mountains of NGC 2174,"This fantastic skyscape lies near the edge of NGC 2174 a star forming region about 6,400 light-years away in the nebula-rich constellation of Orion. It follows mountainous clouds of gas and dust carved by winds and radiation from the region's newborn stars, now found scattered in open star clusters embedded around the center of NGC 2174, off the top of the frame. Though star formation continues within these dusty cosmic clouds they will likely be dispersed by the energetic newborn stars within a few million years.

Jets from Unusual Galaxy Centaurus A,"The jets emanating from Centaurus A are over a million light years long. These jets of streaming plasma, expelled by a giant black hole in the center of this spiral galaxy,  light up this composite image of Cen A. Exactly how the central black hole expels infalling matter remains unknown. After clearing the galaxy, however, the jets inflate large radio bubbles that likely glow for millions of years. If energized by a passing gas cloud, the radio bubbles can even light up again after billions of years. X-ray light is depicted in the featured composite image in blue, while microwave light is colored orange.  The base of the jet in radio light shows details of the innermost light year of the central jet.","unusual, galaxy, centaurus, emanating, light, year, streaming, plasma, expelled, giant, black, hole, center, spiral, composite, image, central, expels, infalling, matter, remains, unknown, clearing, inflate, large, radio, bubble, likely, glow, energized, passing, cloud, x-ray, depicted, featured, blue, microwave, colored, orange, base, show, detail, innermost"
The Medulla Nebula Supernova Remnant,"What powers this unusual nebula? CTB-1 is the expanding gas shell that was left when a massive star toward the constellation of Cassiopeia exploded about 10,000 years ago. The star likely detonated when it ran out of elements, near its core, that could create stabilizing pressure with nuclear fusion. The resulting supernova remnant, nicknamed the Medulla Nebula for its brain-like shape, still glows in visible light by the heat generated by its collision with confining interstellar gas.  Why the nebula also glows in X-ray light, though, remains a mystery. One hypothesis holds that an energetic pulsar was co-created that powers the nebula with a fast outwardly moving wind. Following this lead, a pulsar has recently been found in radio waves that appears to have been expelled by the supernova explosion at over 1000 kilometers per second.  Although the Medulla Nebula appears as large as a full moon, it is so faint that it took 130-hours of exposure with two small telescopes in New Mexico, USA, to create the featured image.","medulla, nebula, supernova, remnant, power, unusual, ctb-1, expanding, shell, left, massive, star, constellation, cassiopeia, exploded, year, detonated, element, core, create, stabilizing, pressure, nuclear, fusion, resulting, nicknamed, brain-like, shape, glow, visible, light, heat, generated, collision, confining, interstellar, x-ray, remains, mystery, hypothesis, hold, energetic, pulsar, co-created, moving, wind, following, lead, found, radio, wave, appears, expelled, explosion, kilometer, second, large, full, moon, faint, took, 130-hours, exposure, small, telescope, mexico, featured, image"
A Lunar Corona with Jupiter and Saturn,"Why does a cloudy moon sometimes appear colorful? The effect, called a lunar corona, is created by the quantum mechanical diffraction of light around individual, similarly-sized water droplets in an intervening but mostly-transparent cloud. Since light of different colors has different wavelengths, each color diffracts differently. Lunar Coronae are one of the few  quantum mechanical color effects that can be easily seen with the unaided eye.  Solar coronae are also sometimes evident.  The featured composite image was captured a few days before the close Great Conjunction between Saturn and Jupiter last month. In the foreground, the Italian village of Pieve di Cadore is visible in front of the Sfornioi Mountains.

The Magnetic Field of the Whirlpool Galaxy,"Do magnetic fields always flow along spiral arms?  Our face-on view of the Whirlpool Galaxy (M51) allows a spectacularly clear view of the spiral wave pattern in a disk-shaped galaxy.  When observed with a radio telescope, the magnetic field appears to trace the arms' curvature.  However, with NASA’s flying Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) observatory, the magnetic field at the outer edge of M51's disk appears to weave across the arms instead.  Magnetic fields are inferred by grains of dust aligning in one direction and acting like polaroid glasses on infrared light.  In the featured image, the field orientations determined from this polarized light are algorithmically connected, creating streamlines.  Possibly the gravitational tug of the companion galaxy, at the top of the frame, on the dusty gas of the reddish star-forming regions, visible in the Hubble Space Telescope image, enhances turbulence -- stirring the dust and lines to produce the unexpected field pattern of the outer arms.","magnetic, field, whirlpool, galaxy, spiral, face-on, view, allows, clear, wave, pattern, disk-shaped, observed, radio, telescope, appears, trace, curvature, nasa, flying, stratospheric, observatory, infrared, astronomy, sofia, outer, edge, disk, weave, inferred, grain, dust, aligning, direction, acting, polaroid, glass, light, featured, image, orientation, determined, polarized, connected, creating, streamlines, gravitational, companion, frame, dusty, reddish, star-forming, region, visible, hubble, space, enhances, turbulence, stirring, line, produce, unexpected"
M78 Wide Field,"Interstellar dust clouds and glowing nebulae abound in the fertile constellation of Orion. One of the brightest, M78, is centered in this colorful, wide field view, covering an area north of Orion's belt. At a distance of about 1,500 light-years, the bluish reflection nebula is around 5 light-years across. Its tint is due to dust preferentially reflecting the blue light of hot, young stars. Reflection nebula NGC 2071 is just to the left of M78. Flecks of emission from Herbig-Haro objects, energetic jets from stars in the process of formation, stand out against the dark dust lanes. The exposure also brings out the region's fainter, pervasive reddish glow of atomic hydrogen gas.","wide, field, interstellar, dust, cloud, glowing, nebula, abound, fertile, constellation, orion, brightest, centered, colorful, view, covering, area, north, belt, distance, light-year, bluish, reflection, tint, reflecting, blue, light, young, star, left, fleck, emission, herbig-haro, object, energetic, process, formation, stand, dark, lane, exposure, brings, region, fainter, pervasive, reddish, glow, atomic, hydrogen"
The Milky Ring,"An expanse of cosmic dust, stars and nebulae along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy form a beautiful ring in this projected all-sky view. The creative panorama covers the entire galaxy visible from planet Earth, an ambitious 360 degree mosaic that took two years to complete. Northern hemisphere sites in western China and southern hemisphere sites in New Zealand were used to collect the image data. Like a glowing jewel set in the milky ring, the bulge of the galactic center, is at the very top. Bright planet Jupiter is the beacon just above the central bulge and left of red giant star Antares. Along the plane and almost 180 degrees from the galactic center, at the bottom of the ring is the area around Orion, denizen of the northern hemisphere's evening winter skies. In this projection the ring of the Milky Way encompasses two notable galaxies in southern skies, the large and small Magellanic clouds.","milky, ring, expanse, cosmic, dust, star, nebula, plane, galaxy, form, beautiful, projected, all-sky, view, creative, panorama, cover, entire, visible, planet, earth, ambitious, degree, mosaic, took, year, complete, northern, site, western, china, southern, zealand, used, collect, image, data, glowing, jewel, bulge, galactic, center, bright, jupiter, beacon, central, left, giant, antares, bottom, area, orion, denizen, evening, winter, projection, encompasses, notable, large, small, magellanic, cloud"
Recycling Cassiopeia A,"Massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After a few million years, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the explosion which created this supernova remnant would have been first seen in planet Earth's sky about 350 years ago, although it took that light about 11,000 years to reach us. This false-color image, composed of X-ray and optical image data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope, shows the still hot filaments and knots in the remnant. It spans about 30 light-years at the estimated distance of Cassiopeia A. High-energy X-ray emission from specific elements has been color coded, silicon in red, sulfur in yellow, calcium in green and iron in purple, to help astronomers explore the recycling of our galaxy's star stuff. Still expanding, the outer blast wave is seen in blue hues. The bright speck near the center is a neutron star, the incredibly dense, collapsed remains of the massive stellar core.","recycling, cassiopeia, massive, star, milky, galaxy, live, spectacular, life, collapsing, vast, cosmic, cloud, nuclear, furnace, ignite, create, heavy, element, core, year, enriched, material, blasted, interstellar, space, formation, begin, expanding, debris, known, example, final, phase, stellar, cycle, light, explosion, created, supernova, remnant, seen, planet, earth, took, reach, false-color, image, composed, x-ray, optical, data, chandra, observatory, hubble, telescope, show, filament, knot, span, light-year, estimated, distance, high-energy, emission, specific, color, coded, silicon, sulfur, yellow, calcium, green, iron, purple, help, astronomer, stuff, outer, blast, wave, blue, bright, speck, center, neutron, dense, collapsed, remains"
Massive Nearby Spiral Galaxy NGC 2841,"It is one of the more massive galaxies known. A mere 46 million light-years distant, spiral galaxy NGC 2841 can be found in the northern constellation of Ursa Major. This sharp view of the gorgeous island universe shows off a striking yellow nucleus and galactic disk. Dust lanes, small, pink star-forming regions, and young blue star clusters are embedded in the patchy, tightly wound spiral arms. In contrast, many other spirals exhibit grand, sweeping arms with large star-forming regions.  NGC 2841 has a diameter of over 150,000 light-years, even larger than our own Milky Way. The featured composite image merges exposures from the orbiting 2.4-meter Hubble Space Telescope and the ground-based 8.2-meter Subaru Telescope.  X-ray images suggest that resulting winds and stellar explosions create plumes of hot gas extending into a halo around NGC 2841.","massive, nearby, spiral, galaxy, known, light-year, distant, found, northern, constellation, major, sharp, view, gorgeous, island, universe, show, striking, yellow, nucleus, galactic, disk, dust, lane, small, pink, star-forming, region, young, blue, star, cluster, embedded, patchy, contrast, many, exhibit, grand, sweeping, large, diameter, larger, milky, featured, composite, image, merges, exposure, orbiting, 2.4-meter, hubble, space, telescope, ground-based, 8.2-meter, subaru, x-ray, suggest, resulting, stellar, explosion, create, plume, extending, halo"
Southern Cross over Chilean Volcano,"Have you ever seen the Southern Cross? This famous four-star icon is best seen from Earth's Southern Hemisphere. The featured image was taken last month in Chile and captures the Southern Cross just to the left of erupting Villarrica, one of the most active volcanos in our Solar System.  Connecting the reddest Southern Cross star Gacrux through the brightest star  Acrux points near the most southern location in the sky: the South Celestial Pole (SCP), around which all southern stars appear to spin as the Earth turns. In modern times, no bright star resides near the SCP, unlike in the north where bright Polaris now appears near the NCP.  Extending the Gacrux - Acrux line still further (from about four to about seven times their angular separation) leads near the Small Magellanic Cloud, a bright satellite galaxy of our Milky Way Galaxy.  The Southern Cross asterism dominates the Crux constellation, a deeper array of stars that includes four Cepheid variable stars visible to the unaided eye. Just above the volcano in the image, and looking like a dark plume, is the Coalsack Nebula, while the large red star-forming Carina Nebula is visible on the upper left.

Central NGC 1316: After Galaxies Collide,"How did this strange-looking galaxy form?  Astronomers turn detectives when trying to figure out the cause of unusual jumbles of stars, gas, and dust like NGC 1316. Inspection indicates that NGC 1316 is an enormous elliptical galaxy that somehow includes dark dust lanes usually found in a spiral galaxy.  Detailed images taken by the Hubble Space Telescope shows details, however, that help in reconstructing the history of this gigantic tangle.  Deep and wide images show huge collisional shells, while deep central images reveal fewer globular clusters of stars toward NGC 1316's interior.  Such effects are expected in galaxies that have undergone collisions or merging with other galaxies in the past few billion years.  The dark knots and lanes of dust, prominent in the featured image, indicate that one or more of the devoured galaxies were spiral galaxies.  NGC 1316 spans about 50,000 light years and lies about 60 million light years away toward the constellation of the Furnace (Fornax).","central, galaxy, collide, strange-looking, form, astronomer, turn, detective, trying, figure, cause, unusual, jumble, star, dust, inspection, indicates, enormous, elliptical, includes, dark, lane, found, spiral, detailed, image, taken, hubble, space, telescope, show, detail, help, reconstructing, history, gigantic, tangle, deep, wide, huge, collisional, shell, reveal, fewer, globular, cluster, interior, effect, expected, undergone, collision, merging, past, year, knot, prominent, featured, indicate, devoured, span, light, constellation, furnace, fornax"
The Vertical Magnetic Field of NGC 5775,"How far do magnetic fields extend up and out of spiral galaxies?  For decades astronomers knew only that some spiral galaxies had magnetic fields.  However, after NRAO's Very Large Array (VLA) radio telescope (popularized in the movie Contact) was upgraded in 2011, it was unexpectedly discovered that these fields could extend vertically away from the disk by several thousand light-years.  The featured image of edge-on spiral galaxy NGC 5775, observed in the CHANG-ES (Continuum Halos in Nearby Galaxies) survey, also reveals spurs of magnetic field lines that may be common in spirals.  Analogous to iron filings around a bar magnet, radiation from electrons trace galactic magnetic field lines by spiraling around these lines at almost the speed of light.  The filaments in this image are constructed from those tracks in VLA data.  The visible light image, constructed from Hubble Space Telescope data, shows pink gaseous regions where stars are born.  It seems that winds from these regions help form the magnificently extended galactic magnetic fields.","vertical, magnetic, field, extend, spiral, galaxy, decade, astronomer, knew, large, array, radio, telescope, popularized, movie, contact, upgraded, discovered, disk, several, light-year, featured, image, edge-on, observed, chang-es, continuum, halo, survey, reveals, spur, line, common, analogous, iron, filing, magnet, radiation, trace, galactic, spiraling, speed, light, filament, constructed, track, data, visible, hubble, space, show, pink, gaseous, region, star, born, seems, wind, help, form, extended"
Messier 66 Close Up,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy Messier 66 lies a mere 35 million light-years away. The gorgeous island universe is about 100 thousand light-years across, similar in size to the Milky Way. This reprocessed Hubble Space Telescope close-up view spans a region about 30,000 light-years wide around the galactic core. It shows the galaxy's disk dramatically inclined to our line-of-sight. Surrounding its bright core, the likely home of a supermassive black hole, obscuring dust lanes and young, blue star clusters sweep along spiral arms dotted with the tell-tale glow of pinksh star forming regions.

North American Nightscape,"On January 21, light from the Moon near first quarter illuminated the foreground in this snowy mountain and night scene. Known as The Lions, the striking pair of mountain peaks are north of Vancouver, British Colombia, Canada, North America, planet Earth. Poised above the twin summits, left of Deneb alpha star of the constellation Cygnus, are emission regions NGC 7000 and IC 5070. Part of a large star forming complex about 1,500 light-years from Vancouver, they shine with the characteristic red glow of atomic hydrogen gas. Outlines of the bright emission regions suggest their popular names, The North America Nebula and The Pelican Nebula. The well-planned, deep nightscape is a composite of consecutive exposures made with a modified digital camera and telephoto lens. Foreground exposures were made with camera fixed to a tripod, background exposures were made tracking the sky. The result preserves sharp natural detail and reveals a range of brightness and color that your eye can't quite see on its own.","north, american, nightscape, january, light, moon, first, quarter, illuminated, snowy, mountain, night, scene, known, lion, striking, pair, peak, vancouver, british, colombia, canada, america, planet, earth, poised, twin, summit, left, deneb, alpha, star, constellation, cygnus, emission, region, part, large, forming, complex, light-year, shine, characteristic, glow, atomic, hydrogen, outline, bright, suggest, popular, name, nebula, pelican, well-planned, deep, composite, consecutive, exposure, made, modified, digital, camera, telephoto, lens, foreground, fixed, tripod, background, tracking, result, preserve, sharp, natural, detail, reveals, range, brightness, color, quite"
"Southern Sky from 38,000 Feet","Celestial sights of the southern sky shine above a cloudy planet Earth in this gorgeous night sky view. The scene was captured from an airliner's flight deck at 38,000 feet on a steady westbound ride to Lima, Peru. To produce the sharp airborne astrophotograph, the best of a series of short exposures were selected and digitally stacked. The broad band of the southern Milky Way begins at top left with the dark Coalsack Nebula and Southern Cross. Its expanse of diffuse starlight encompasses the the Carina Nebula and large Gum Nebula toward the right. Canopus, alpha star of Carina and second brightest star in Earth's night is easy to spot below the Milky Way, as is the dwarf galaxy known as the Large Magellanic Cloud.

Asteroids in the Distance,"Rocks from space hit Earth every day.  The larger the rock, though, the less often Earth is struck.  Many kilograms of space dust pitter to Earth daily. Larger bits appear initially as a bright meteor.  Baseball-sized rocks and ice-balls streak through our atmosphere daily, most evaporating quickly to nothing.  Significant threats do exist for rocks near 100 meters in diameter, which strike the Earth roughly every 1000 years.  An object this size could cause significant tsunamis were it to strike an ocean, potentially devastating even distant shores. A collision with a massive asteroid, over 1 km across, is more rare, occurring typically millions of years apart, but could have truly global consequences. Many asteroids remain undiscovered.  In the featured image, one such asteroid -- shown by the long blue streak -- was found by chance in 1998 by the Hubble Space Telescope. A collision with a large asteroid  would not affect Earth's orbit so much as raise dust that would affect Earth's climate.  One likely result is a global extinction of many species of life, possibly dwarfing the ongoing extinction occurring now.","asteroid, distance, rock, space, earth, larger, struck, many, kilogram, dust, pitter, appear, bright, meteor, baseball-sized, ice-balls, streak, atmosphere, daily, evaporating, nothing, significant, threat, exist, meter, diameter, strike, year, object, size, cause, tsunami, ocean, devastating, distant, shore, collision, massive, rare, occurring, truly, global, consequence, remain, undiscovered, featured, image, shown, long, blue, found, chance, hubble, telescope, large, affect, orbit, much, raise, climate, likely, result, extinction, specie, life, dwarfing, ongoing"
Lunar Halo over Snowy Trees,"Have you ever seen a halo around the Moon?  This fairly common sight occurs when high thin clouds containing millions of tiny ice crystals cover much of the sky.  Each ice crystal acts like a miniature lens.  Because most of the crystals have a similar elongated hexagonal shape, light entering one crystal face and exiting through the opposing face refracts 22 degrees, which corresponds to the radius of the Moon Halo.  A similar Sun Halo may be visible during the day.  Exactly how ice-crystals form in clouds remains a topic of research. In the featured image taken last week from Östersund, Sweden, a complete lunar halo was captured over snowy trees and rabbit tracks.

A Colorful Quadrantid Meteor,"Meteors can be colorful. While the human eye usually cannot discern many colors, cameras often can. Pictured is a Quadrantids meteor captured by camera over Missouri, USA, early this month that was not only impressively bright, but colorful. The radiant grit, likely cast off by asteroid 2003 EH1, blazed a path across Earth's atmosphere.  Colors in meteors usually originate from ionized elements released as the meteor disintegrates, with blue-green typically originating from magnesium, calcium radiating violet, and nickel glowing green. Red, however, typically originates from energized nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.  This bright meteoric fireball was gone in a flash -- less than a second -- but it left a wind-blown ionization trail that remained visible for several minutes.

Found on the Moon: Candidate for Oldest Known Earth Rock,"Was the oldest known rock on Earth found on the Moon? Quite possibly.  The story opens with the Apollo 14 lunar mission. Lunar sample 14321, a large rock found in Cone crater by astronaut Alan Shepard, when analyzed back on Earth, was found to have a fragment that was a much better match to Earth rocks than other Moon rocks.  Even more surprising, that rock section has recently been dated back 4 billion years, making it older, to within measurement uncertainty, than any rock ever found on Earth.  A leading hypothesis now holds that an ancient comet or asteroid impact launched Earth rocks into the Solar System, some of which fell back to the Moon, became mixed with heated lunar soil and other rocks, cooled, and re-fragmented.  The video features an internal X-ray scan of 14321 showing multiple sections with markedly different chemistries. Moon rocks will continue to be studied to learn a more complete history of the Moon, the Earth, and the early Solar System.  Friday marks the 50th Anniversary of the Apollo 14 landing on the Moon.","found, moon, candidate, oldest, known, earth, rock, story, open, apollo, lunar, mission, sample, large, crater, astronaut, alan, shepard, analyzed, much, better, match, surprising, section, dated, year, making, older, measurement, uncertainty, leading, hypothesis, hold, ancient, comet, asteroid, impact, launched, solar, system, fell, became, mixed, heated, soil, cooled, re-fragmented, video, feature, internal, x-ray, scan, showing, multiple, different, chemistry, continue, studied, learn, complete, history, friday, mark, 50th, anniversary, landing"
Apollo 14: A View from Antares,"Fifty years ago this Friday, Apollo 14's Lunar Module Antares landed on the Moon. Toward the end of the stay astronaut Ed Mitchell snapped a series of photos of the lunar surface while looking out a window, assembled into this detailed mosaic by Apollo Lunar Surface Journal editor Eric Jones. The view looks across the Fra Mauro highlands to the northwest of the landing site after the Apollo 14 astronauts had completed their second and final walk on the Moon. Prominent in the foreground is their Modular Equipment Transporter, a two-wheeled, rickshaw-like device used to carry tools and samples. Near the horizon at top center is a 1.5 meter wide boulder dubbed Turtle rock. In the shallow crater below Turtle rock is the long white handle of a sampling instrument, thrown there javelin-style by Mitchell.

Apollo 14 Heads for Home,"Fifty years ago this Sunday (February 7, 1971), the crew of Apollo 14 left lunar orbit and headed for home. They watched this Earthrise from their command module Kitty Hawk. With Earth's sunlit crescent just peeking over the lunar horizon, the cratered terrain in the foreground is along the lunar farside. Of course, while orbiting the Moon, the crew could watch Earth rise and set, but from the lunar surface the Earth hung stationary in the sky over their landing site at Fra Mauro Base. Rock samples returned from Fra Mauro included a 20 pound rock nicknamed Big Bertha, determined to contain a likely fragment of a meteorite from planet Earth.

Blue Straggler Stars in Globular Cluster M53,"If our Sun were part of this star cluster, the night sky would glow like a jewel box of bright stars. This cluster, known as M53 and cataloged as NGC 5024, is one of about 250 globular clusters that survive in our Galaxy. Most of the stars in M53 are older and redder than our Sun, but some enigmatic stars appear to be bluer and younger. These young stars might contradict the hypothesis that all the stars in M53 formed at nearly the same time. These unusual stars are known as blue stragglers and are unusually common in M53. After much debate, blue stragglers are now thought to be stars rejuvenated by fresh matter falling in from a binary star companion. By analyzing pictures of globular clusters like the featured image taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, astronomers use the abundance of stars like blue stragglers to help determine the age of the globular cluster and hence a limit on the age of the universe. M53, visible with a binoculars towards the constellation of Bernice's Hair (Coma Berenices), contains over 250,000 stars and is one of the furthest globulars from the center of our Galaxy.","blue, straggler, star, globular, cluster, part, night, glow, jewel, bright, known, cataloged, survive, galaxy, older, redder, enigmatic, appear, bluer, younger, young, contradict, hypothesis, formed, time, unusual, common, much, debate, thought, rejuvenated, fresh, matter, falling, binary, companion, analyzing, picture, featured, image, taken, hubble, space, telescope, astronomer, abundance, help, determine, hence, limit, universe, visible, binoculars, constellation, bernice, hair, coma, berenices, contains, furthest, globulars, center"
WR23 and Interstellar Clouds in Carina,"Stars can be like artists. With interstellar gas as a canvas, a massive and tumultuous Wolf-Rayet star has created the picturesque ruffled half-circular filaments called WR23, on the image left. Additionally, the winds and radiation from a small cluster of stars, NGC 3324, have sculpted a 35 light year cavity on the upper right, with its right side appearing as a recognizable face in profile.  This region's popular name is the Gabriela Mistral Nebula for the famous  Chilean poet. Together, these interstellar clouds lie about 8,000 light-years away in the Great Carina Nebula, a complex stellar neighborhood harboring numerous clouds of gas and dust rich with imagination inspiring shapes.

Flashes of the Crab Pulsar,"It somehow survived an explosion that would surely have destroyed our Sun. Now it is spins 30 times a second and is famous for the its rapid flashes. It is the Crab Pulsar, the rotating neutron star remnant of the supernova that created the Crab Nebula. A careful eye can spot the pulsar flashes in the featured time-lapse video, just above the image center. The video was created by adding together images taken only when the pulsar was flashing, as well as co-added images from other relative times.  The Crab Pulsar flashes may have been first noted by an unknown woman attending a public observing night at the University of Chicago in 1957 -- but who was not believed.  The progenitor supernova explosion was seen by many in the year 1054 AD.  The expanding Crab Nebula remains a picturesque expanding gas cloud that glows across the electromagnetic spectrum.  The pulsar is now thought to have survived the supernova explosion because it is composed of extremely-dense quantum-degenerate matter.   Who was this mystery woman?

Firing Lasers to Tame the Sky,"Why do stars twinkle? Our atmosphere is to blame as pockets of slightly off-temperature air, in constant motion, distort the light paths from distant astronomical objects. Atmospheric turbulence is a problem for astronomers because it blurs the images of the sources they want to study. The telescope featured in this image, located at ESO’s Paranal Observatory, is equipped with four lasers to combat this turbulence. The lasers are tuned to a color that excites atoms floating high in Earth's atmosphere -- sodium left by passing meteors. These glowing sodium spots act as artificial stars whose twinkling is immediately recorded and passed to a flexible mirror that deforms hundreds of times per second, counteracting atmospheric turbulence and resulting in crisper images. The de-twinkling of stars is a developing field of technology and allows, in some cases, Hubble-class images to be taken from the ground.  This technique has also led to spin-off applications in human vision science, where it is used to obtain very sharp images of the retina.","firing, laser, tame, star, twinkle, blame, pocket, off-temperature, constant, motion, distort, light, path, distant, astronomical, object, atmospheric, turbulence, problem, astronomer, blur, image, source, want, study, telescope, featured, located, paranal, observatory, equipped, combat, tuned, color, excites, floating, high, earth, atmosphere, sodium, left, passing, meteor, glowing, spot, artificial, twinkling, recorded, passed, flexible, mirror, deforms, hundred, time, second, counteracting, resulting, crisper, de-twinkling, developing, field, technology, allows, case, hubble-class, taken, ground, technique, spin-off, application, human, vision, science, used, obtain, sharp, retina"
Cygnus Mosaic 2010 - 2020,"In brush strokes of interstellar dust and glowing gas, this beautiful skyscape is painted across the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy near the northern end of the Great Rift and the constellation Cygnus the Swan.

Many other nebulae and star clusters are identifiable throughout the cosmic scene. Of course, Deneb itself is also known to northern hemisphere skygazers for its place in two asterisms, marking a vertex of the Summer Triangle, the top of the Northern Cross.","cygnus, mosaic, brush, stroke, interstellar, dust, glowing, beautiful, skyscape, painted, plane, milky, galaxy, northern, great, rift, constellation, swan, composed, decade, hour, image, data, broad, span, impressive, degree, alpha, star, bright, supergiant, deneb, left, crowded, luminous, cloud, home, dark, obscuring, coal, sack, nebula, forming, emission, region, north, america, pelican, little, many, cluster, identifiable, cosmic, scene, course, known, hemisphere, skygazers, place, asterism, marking, vertex, summer, triangle, cross"
Spiral Galaxy NGC 1350,"This gorgeous island universe lies about 85 million light-years distant in the southern constellation Fornax. Inhabited by young blue star clusters, the tightly wound spiral arms of NGC 1350 seem to join in a circle around the galaxy's large, bright nucleus, giving it the appearance of a cosmic eye. In fact, NGC 1350 is about 130,000 light-years across. That makes it as large or slightly larger than the Milky Way. For earth-based astronomers, NGC 1350 is seen on the outskirts of the Fornax cluster of galaxies, but its estimated distance suggests that it is not itself a cluster member. Of course, the bright spiky stars in the foreground of this telescopic field of view are members of our own spiral Milky Way galaxy.","spiral, galaxy, gorgeous, island, universe, light-year, distant, southern, constellation, fornax, inhabited, young, blue, star, cluster, seem, join, circle, large, bright, nucleus, giving, appearance, cosmic, fact, make, larger, milky, earth-based, astronomer, seen, outskirt, estimated, distance, suggests, member, course, spiky, foreground, telescopic, field, view"
Stereo Eros,"Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to asteroid 433 Eros. Orbiting the Sun once every 1.8 years, the near-Earth asteroid is named for the Greek god of love. Still, its shape more closely resembles a lumpy potato than a heart. Eros is a diminutive 40 x 14 x 14 kilometer world of undulating horizons, craters, boulders and valleys. Its unsettling scale and unromantic shape are emphasized in this mosaic of images from the NEAR Shoemaker spacecraft processed to yield a stereo anaglyphic view.  Along with dramatic chiaroscuro, NEAR Shoemaker's 3-D imaging provided important measurements of the asteroid's landforms and structures, and clues to the origin of this city-sized chunk of Solar System. The smallest features visible here are about 30 meters across. Beginning on February 14, 2000, historic NEAR Shoemaker spent a year in orbit around Eros, the first spacecraft to orbit an asteroid. Twenty years ago, on February 12 2001, it landed on Eros, the first ever landing on an asteroid's surface. NEAR Shoemaker's final transmission from the surface of Eros was on February 28, 2001.","stereo, eros, red/blue, glass, float, asteroid, orbiting, year, near-earth, named, greek, love, shape, resembles, lumpy, potato, heart, diminutive, kilometer, world, undulating, horizon, crater, boulder, valley, unsettling, scale, unromantic, emphasized, mosaic, image, shoemaker, spacecraft, processed, yield, anaglyphic, view, dramatic, chiaroscuro, imaging, provided, important, measurement, landforms, structure, clue, city-sized, chunk, solar, system, smallest, feature, visible, meter, beginning, february, historic, spent, orbit, landed, landing, surface, final, transmission"
Long Stem Rosette Nebula,"Would the Rosette Nebula by any other name look as sweet? The bland New General Catalog designation of NGC 2237 doesn't appear to diminish the appearance of this flowery emission nebula, at the top of the image, atop a long stem of glowing hydrogen gas. Inside the nebula lies an open cluster of bright young stars designated NGC 2244. These stars formed about four million years ago from the nebular material and their stellar winds are clearing a hole in the nebula's center, insulated by a layer of dust and hot gas. Ultraviolet light from the hot cluster stars causes the surrounding nebula to glow. The Rosette Nebula spans about 100 light-years across, lies about 5000 light-years away, and can be seen with a small telescope towards the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros).

Landing on Mars: Seven Minutes of Terror,"Starting Thursday, there may be an amazing new robotic explorer on Mars.  Or there may be a new pile of junk.  It all likely depends on things going correctly in the minutes after the Mars 2020 mission arrives at its new home planet and attempts to deploy the Perseverance rover.  Arguably the most sophisticated landing yet attempted on the red planet, consecutive precision events will involve a heat shield, a parachute, several rocket maneuvers, and the automatic operation of an unusual device called a Sky Crane.  Thursday's Seven Minutes of Terror echo the landing of the Curiosity rover on Mars in 2012, as depicted in the featured video. If successful, the car-sized Perseverance rover will rest on the surface of Mars, soon to begin exploring Jezero Crater to better determine the habitability of this seemingly barren world to life -- past, present, and future.  Although multiple media outlets may cover this event, one way to watch these landing events unfold is on the NASA channel live on the web.

Perseverance: Seven Minutes to Mars,"How hard is it to land safely on Mars? So hard that many more attempts have failed than succeeded.  The next attempt will be on Thursday. The main problem is that the Martian atmosphere is too thick to ignore -- or it will melt your spacecraft.  On the other hand, the atmosphere is too thin to rely on parachutes -- or your spacecraft will crash land.  Therefore, as outlined in the featured video, the Perseverance lander will lose much of its high speed by deploying a huge parachute, but then switch to rockets, and finally, assuming everything goes right, culminate with a hovering Sky Crane that will slowly lower the car-sized Perseverance rover to the surface with ropes.  It may sound crazy, but the Curiosity rover was placed on Mars using a similar method in 2012.  From atmospheric entry to surface touch-down takes about seven minutes, all coordinated by an onboard computer because Mars is too far away for rapid interactive communication.  During this time, humans on Earth will simply wait to hear if the landing was successful. Last week, UAE's Hope spacecraft successfully began orbiting Mars, followed a day later by the Chinese Tianwen-1 mission, which will likely schedule a landing of its own rover sometime in the next few months.

Sun Pillar with Upper Tangent Arc,"This was not a typical sun pillar.  Just after sunrise two weeks ago in Providence, Rhode Island, USA, a photographer, looking out his window, was suddenly awestruck. The astonishment was caused by a sun pillar that fanned out at the top.  Sun pillars, singular columns of light going up from the Sun, are themselves rare to see, and are known to be caused by sunlight reflecting from wobbling, hexagon-shaped ice-disks falling through Earth's atmosphere.  Separately, upper tangent arcs are known to be caused by sunlight refracting through falling hexagon-shaped ice-tubes. Finding a sun pillar connected to an upper tangent arc is extraordinary, and, initially, took some analysis to figure out what was going on. A leading theory is that this sun pillar was also created, in a complex and unusual way, by falling ice tubes.  Few might believe that such a rare phenomenon was seen again if it wasn't for the quick thinking of the photographer -- and the camera on his nearby smartphone.

"Swiss Alps, Martian Sky","Taken on February 6, this snowy mountain and skyscape was captured near Melchsee-Frutt, central Switzerland, planet Earth. The reddish daylight and blue tinted glow around the afternoon Sun are colors of the Martian sky, though. Of course both worlds have the same Sun. From Mars, the Sun looks only about half as bright and 2/3 the size compared to its appearance from Earth. Lofted from the surface of Mars, fine dust particles suspended in the thin Martian atmosphere are rich in the iron oxides that make the Red Planet red. They tend to absorb blue sunlight giving a red tinge to the Martian sky, while forward scattering still makes the light appear relatively bluish near the smaller, fainter Martian Sun. Normally Earth's denser atmosphere strongly scatters blue light, making the terrestrial sky blue. But on February 6 a huge cloud of dust blown across the Mediterranean from the Sahara desert reached the Swiss Alps, dimming the Sun and lending that Alpine afternoon the colors of the Martian sky. By the next day, only the snow was left covered with reddish dust.

Mars Perseverance Sol 0,"After a 203 day interplanetary voyage, and seven minutes of terror, Perseverance has landed on Mars.  Confirmation of the successful landing at Jezero crater was announced from mission control at NASA’s Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Southern California at 12:55 pm PST on February 18. The car-sized Mars rover's Front Left Hazard Avoidance Camera acquired this initial low resolution image shortly after touchdown on mission Sol 0.

Perseverance: How to Land on Mars,"Slung beneath its rocket powered descent stage Perseverance hangs only a few meters above the martian surface, captured here moments before its February 18 touchdown on the Red Planet. The breath-taking view followed an intense seven minute trip from the top of the martian atmosphere. Part of a high resolution video, the picture was taken from the descent stage itself during the final skycrane landing maneuver. Three taut mechanical cables about 7 meters long are visible lowering Perseverance, along with an electrical umbilical connection feeding signals (like this image), to a computer on board the car-sized rover. Below Perseverance streamers of martian dust are kicked-up from the surface by the descent rocket engines. Immediately after touchdown, the cables were released allowing the descent stage to fly to a safe distance before exhausting its fuel as planned.","perseverance, land, slung, beneath, rocket, powered, descent, stage, hang, meter, martian, surface, captured, moment, february, touchdown, planet, breath-taking, view, followed, intense, minute, trip, part, high, resolution, video, picture, taken, final, skycrane, landing, maneuver, taut, mechanical, cable, visible, lowering, electrical, umbilical, connection, feeding, signal, image, computer, board, car-sized, rover, streamer, dust, kicked-up, engine, released, allowing, safe, distance, exhausting, fuel, planned"
NGC 2244: A Star Cluster in the Rosette Nebula,"In the heart of the Rosette Nebula lies a bright open cluster of stars that lights up the nebula.  The stars of NGC 2244 formed from the surrounding gas only a few million years ago.  The featured image taken in January using multiple exposures and very specific colors of Sulfur (shaded red), Hydrogen (green), and Oxygen (blue), captures the central region in tremendous detail. A hot wind of particles streams away from the cluster stars and contributes to an already complex menagerie of gas and dust filaments while slowly evacuating the cluster center.  The Rosette Nebula's center measures about 50 light-years across, lies about 5,200 light-years away, and is visible with binoculars towards the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros).","star, cluster, rosette, nebula, heart, bright, open, light, formed, surrounding, year, featured, image, taken, january, using, multiple, exposure, specific, color, sulfur, shaded, hydrogen, green, oxygen, blue, capture, central, region, tremendous, detail, wind, particle, stream, contributes, complex, menagerie, dust, filament, evacuating, center, measure, light-year, visible, binoculars, constellation, unicorn, monoceros"
Moon Rising Between Starships,"What's that on either side of the Moon? Starships. Specifically, they are launch-and-return reusable rockets being developed by SpaceX to lift cargo and eventually humans from the Earth's surface into space.  The two rockets pictured are SN9 (Serial Number 9) and SN10 which were captured near their Boca Chica, Texas launchpad last month posing below January's full Wolf Moon. The Starships house liquid-methane engines inside rugged stainless-steel shells. SN9 was test-launched earlier this month and did well with the exception of one internal rocket that failed to relight during powered descent.  SN10 continues to undergo ground tests and may be test-launched later this month.","moon, rising, starship, side, launch-and-return, reusable, rocket, developed, spacex, lift, cargo, human, earth, surface, space, pictured, serial, number, sn10, captured, boca, chica, texas, launchpad, last, month, posing, january, full, wolf, house, liquid-methane, engine, rugged, stainless-steel, shell, test-launched, internal, failed, relight, powered, descent, continues, undergo, ground, test, later"
Video: Perseverance Landing on Mars,"What would it look like to land on Mars?  To better monitor the instruments involved in the Entry, Decent, and Landing of the Perseverance Rover on Mars last week, cameras with video capability were included that have now returned their images. The featured 3.5-minute composite video begins with the opening of a huge parachute that dramatically slows the speeding spacecraft as it enters the Martian atmosphere.  Next the heat shield is seen separating and falls ahead. As Perseverance descends, Mars looms large and its surface becomes increasingly detailed.  At just past 2-minutes into the video, the parachute is released and Perseverance begins to land with dust-scattering rockets. Soon the Sky Crane takes over and puts Perseverance down softly, then quickly jetting away. The robotic Perseverance rover will now begin exploring ancient Jezero Crater, including a search for signs that life once existed on Earth's neighboring planet.","video, perseverance, landing, look, land, monitor, instrument, involved, entry, decent, rover, last, week, camera, capability, included, returned, image, featured, 3.5-minute, composite, begin, opening, huge, parachute, slows, speeding, spacecraft, enters, martian, next, heat, shield, seen, separating, fall, descends, loom, large, surface, becomes, detailed, 2-minutes, released, dust-scattering, rocket, crane, take, jetting, robotic, exploring, ancient, jezero, crater, including, search, sign, life, existed, earth, neighboring, planet"
Spiral Galaxy M66 from Hubble,"It’s always nice to get a new view of an old friend.  This stunning Hubble Space Telescope image of nearby spiral galaxy M66 is just that.  A spiral galaxy with a small central bar, M66 is a member of the Leo Galaxy Triplet, a group of three galaxies about 30 million light years from us.  The Leo Triplet is a popular target for relatively small telescopes, in part because M66 and its galactic companions M65 and NGC 3628 all appear separated by about the angular width of a full moon.  The featured image of M66 was taken by Hubble to help investigate the connection between star formation and molecular gas clouds.  Clearly visible are bright blue stars, pink ionized hydrogen clouds -- sprinkled all along the outer spiral arms, and dark dust lanes in which more star formation could be hiding.","spiral, galaxy, hubble, view, friend, stunning, space, telescope, image, nearby, small, central, member, triplet, group, light, year, popular, target, part, galactic, companion, appear, separated, angular, full, moon, featured, taken, help, investigate, connection, star, formation, molecular, cloud, visible, bright, blue, pink, ionized, hydrogen, sprinkled, outer, dark, dust, lane, hiding"
A Venus Flyby,"On a mission to explore the inner heliosphere and solar corona, on July 11, 2020 the Wide-field Imager on board NASA's Parker Solar Probe captured this stunning view of the nightside of Venus at distance of about 12,400 kilometers (7,693 miles). The spacecraft was making the third of seven gravity-assist flybys of the inner planet. The gravity-asssist flybys are designed to use the approach to Venus to help the probe alter its orbit to ultimately come within 6 million kilometers (4 million miles) of the solar surface in late 2025. A surprising image, the side-looking camera seems to peer through the clouds to show a dark feature near the center known as Aphrodite Terra, the largest highland region on the Venusian surface. The bright rim at the edge of the planet is nightglow likely emitted by excited oxygen atoms recombining into molecules in the upper reaches of the atmosphere. Bright streaks and blemishes throughout the image are likely due to energetic charged particles, and dust near the camera reflecting sunlight. Skygazers from planet Earth probably recognize the familiar stars of Orion's belt and sword at lower right.","venus, flyby, mission, explore, inner, solar, corona, wide-field, imager, board, nasa, parker, probe, captured, stunning, view, distance, kilometer, mile, spacecraft, making, third, gravity-assist, flybys, planet, gravity-asssist, designed, approach, help, alter, orbit, come, surface, surprising, image, side-looking, camera, seems, peer, cloud, show, dark, feature, center, known, aphrodite, terra, largest, highland, region, venusian, bright, edge, nightglow, emitted, excited, oxygen, atom, recombining, molecule, upper, reach, streak, blemish, likely, energetic, charged, particle, dust, reflecting, sunlight, skygazers, earth, recognize, familiar, star, orion, belt, sword, lower, right"

The Aurora Tree,"Yes, but can your tree do this?  Pictured is a visual coincidence between the dark branches of a nearby tree and bright glow of a distant aurora. The beauty of the aurora -- combined with how it seemed to mimic a tree right nearby -- mesmerized the photographer to such a degree that he momentarily forgot to take pictures. When viewed at the right angle, it seemed that this tree had aurora for leaves. Fortunately, before the aurora morphed into a different overall shape, he came to his senses and capture the awe-inspiring momentary coincidence.  Typically triggered by solar explosions, aurora are caused by high energy electrons impacting the Earth's atmosphere around 150 kilometers up.

The Pelican Nebula in Red and Blue,"The Pelican Nebula is changing.   The entire nebula, officially designated IC 5070, is divided from the larger North America Nebula by a molecular cloud filled with dark dust.  The Pelican, however, is particularly interesting because it is an unusually active mix of star formation and evolving gas clouds.  The featured picture was processed to bring out two main colors, red and blue, with the red dominated by light emitted by interstellar hydrogen. Ultraviolet light emitted by young energetic stars is slowly transforming cold gas in the nebula to hot gas, with the advancing boundary between the two, known as an ionization front, visible in bright red across the image center. Particularly dense tentacles of cold gas remain.  Millions of years from now this nebula might no longer be known as the Pelican, as the balance and placement of stars and gas will surely leave something that appears completely different.

Pillars of the Eagle Nebula in Infrared,"Newborn stars are forming in the Eagle Nebula.  Gravitationally contracting in pillars of dense gas and dust, the intense radiation of these newly-formed bright stars is causing surrounding material to boil away. This image, taken with the Hubble Space Telescope in near infrared light, allows the viewer to see through much of the thick dust that makes the pillars opaque in visible light.  The giant structures are light years in length and dubbed informally the Pillars of Creation.  Associated with the open star cluster M16, the Eagle Nebula lies about 6,500 light years away.  The Eagle Nebula is an easy target for small telescopes in a nebula-rich part of the sky toward the split constellation Serpens Cauda (the tail of the snake).","pillar, eagle, nebula, infrared, newborn, star, forming, contracting, dense, dust, intense, radiation, newly-formed, bright, causing, surrounding, material, boil, image, taken, hubble, space, telescope, light, allows, viewer, much, thick, make, opaque, visible, giant, structure, year, length, dubbed, creation, associated, open, cluster, easy, target, small, nebula-rich, part, split, constellation, serpens, cauda, tail, snake"
Three Tails of Comet NEOWISE,"What created the unusual red tail in Comet NEOWISE? Sodium.  A spectacular sight back in the summer of 2020, Comet NEOWISE, at times, displayed something more than just a surprisingly striated white dust tail and a pleasingly patchy blue ion tail. Some color sensitive images showed an unusual red tail, and analysis showed much of this third tail's color was emitted by sodium.  Gas rich in sodium atoms might have been liberated from Comet NEOWISE's warming nucleus in early July by bright sunlight, electrically charged by ultraviolet sunlight, and then pushed out by the solar wind. The featured image was captured in mid-July from Brittany, France and shows the real colors. Sodium comet tails have been seen before but are rare -- this one disappeared by late July.  Comet C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) has since faded, lost all of its bright tails, and now approaches the orbit of Jupiter as it heads back to the outer Solar System, to return only in about 7,000 years.

Perseverance 360: Unusual Rocks and the Search for Life on Mars,"Is that a fossil?  Looking through recent images of Mars taken by the new Perseverance rover may seem a bit like treasure hunting, with the possibility of fame coming to the first person to correctly identify a petrified bone, a rock imprinted by an ancient plant, or any clear indication that life once existed on Mars.  Unfortunately, even though it is possible that something as spectacular as a skeleton could be identified, most exobiologists think it much more likely that biochemical remnants of ancient single-celled microbes could be found with Perseverance's chemical analyzers.  A key reason is that multicellular organisms may take a greater amount of oxygen to evolve than has ever been present on Mars. That said, nobody's sure, so please feel free to digitally magnify any Perseverance image that interests you -- including the featured 360-degree zoomable image of the rocks and ridges surrounding Perseverance's landing location in Jezero Crater.  And even though NASA-affiliated scientists are themselves studying Perseverance's images, if you see anything really unusual, please post it to popular social media. If your sighting turns out to be particularly intriguing, scientifically, it is likely that NASA will hear about it.","perseverance, unusual, rock, search, life, fossil, looking, recent, image, taken, rover, seem, treasure, hunting, possibility, fame, coming, first, person, identify, petrified, bone, imprinted, ancient, plant, clear, indication, existed, possible, something, spectacular, skeleton, identified, exobiologists, think, likely, biochemical, remnant, single-celled, microbe, found, chemical, analyzer, reason, multicellular, organism, take, greater, amount, oxygen, evolve, present, said, nobody, sure, please, feel, free, magnify, interest, including, featured, 360-degree, zoomable, ridge, surrounding, landing, location, jezero, crater, nasa-affiliated, scientist, studying, anything, post, popular, social, medium, sighting, turn, intriguing, nasa, hear"
NGC 1499: The California Nebula,"Could Queen Calafia's mythical island exist in space? Perhaps not, but by chance the outline of this molecular space cloud echoes the outline of the state of California, USA. Our Sun has its home within the Milky Way's Orion Arm, only about 1,000 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. On the featured image, the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons, stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight. The star most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot, bluish Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula.  A regular target for astrophotographers, the California Nebula can be spotted with a wide-field telescope under a dark sky toward the constellation of Perseus, not far from the Pleiades.

Zodiacal Light and Mars,"Just after sunset on March 7, a faint band of light still reaches above the western horizon in this serene, rural Illinois, night skyscape. Taken from an old farmstead, the luminous glow is zodiacal light, prominent in the west after sunset during planet Earth's northern hemisphere spring. On that clear evening the band of zodiacal light seems to engulf bright yellowish Mars and the Pleiades star cluster. Their close conjunction is in the starry sky above the old barn's roof. Zodiacal light is sunlight scattered by interplanetary dust particles that lie near the Solar System's ecliptic plane. Of course all the Solar System's planets orbit near the plane of the ecliptic, within the band of zodiacal light. But zodiacal light and Mars may have a deeper connection. A recent analysis of serendipitous detections of interplanetary dust by the Juno spacecraft during its Earth to Jupiter voyage suggest Mars is the likely source of the dust that produces zodiacal light.","zodiacal, light, sunset, march, faint, band, reach, western, horizon, serene, rural, illinois, night, skyscape, taken, farmstead, luminous, glow, prominent, west, planet, earth, northern, hemisphere, spring, clear, evening, seems, engulf, bright, yellowish, pleiades, star, cluster, close, conjunction, starry, barn, roof, sunlight, scattered, interplanetary, dust, particle, solar, system, ecliptic, plane, course, orbit, deeper, connection, recent, analysis, serendipitous, detection, juno, spacecraft, jupiter, voyage, suggest, likely, source, produce"
Messier 81,"One of the brightest galaxies in planet Earth's sky is similar in size to our Milky Way Galaxy: big, beautiful Messier 81. Also known as NGC 3031 or Bode's galaxy for its 18th century discoverer, this grand spiral can be found toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major, the Great Bear. The sharp, detailed telescopic view reveals M81's bright yellow nucleus, blue spiral arms, pinkish starforming regions, and sweeping cosmic dust lanes. Some dust lanes actually run through the galactic disk (left of center), contrary to other prominent spiral features though. The errant dust lanes may be the lingering result of a close encounter between M81 and the nearby galaxy M82 lurking outside of this frame. M81's faint, dwarf irregular satellite galaxy, Holmberg IX, can be seen just below the large spiral. Scrutiny of variable stars in M81 has yielded a well-determined distance for an external galaxy -- 11.8 million light-years.","messier, brightest, galaxy, planet, earth, similar, size, milky, beautiful, known, bode, 18th, century, discoverer, grand, spiral, found, northern, constellation, ursa, major, great, bear, sharp, detailed, telescopic, view, reveals, bright, yellow, nucleus, blue, pinkish, starforming, region, sweeping, cosmic, dust, lane, galactic, disk, left, center, contrary, prominent, feature, errant, lingering, result, close, encounter, nearby, lurking, outside, frame, faint, dwarf, irregular, satellite, holmberg, seen, large, scrutiny, variable, star, yielded, well-determined, distance, external, light-year"
SuperCam Target on Ma'az,"What's the sound of one laser zapping? There's no need to consult a Zen master to find out, just listen to the first acoustic recording of laser shots on Mars. On Perseverance mission sol 12 (March 2) the SuperCam instrument atop the rover's mast zapped a rock dubbed Ma'az 30 times from a range of about 3.1 meters. Its microphone recorded the soft staccato popping sounds of the rapid series of SuperCam laser zaps. Shockwaves created in the thin martian atmosphere as bits of rock are vaporized by the laser shots make the popping sounds, sounds that offer clues to the physical structure of the target. This SuperCam close-up of the Ma'az target region is 6 centimeters (2.3 inches) across. Ma'az means Mars in the Navajo language.","supercam, target, ma'az, sound, laser, zapping, need, consult, master, find, listen, first, acoustic, recording, shot, perseverance, mission, march, instrument, rover, mast, zapped, rock, dubbed, time, range, meter, microphone, recorded, soft, staccato, popping, rapid, series, shockwaves, created, thin, martian, vaporized, make, offer, clue, physical, structure, close-up, region, centimeter, inch, mean, navajo, language"
A Flag Shaped Aurora over Sweden,"It appeared, momentarily, like a 50-km tall banded flag.  In mid-March of 2015, an energetic Coronal Mass Ejection directed toward a clear magnetic channel to Earth led to one of the more intense geomagnetic storms of recent years. A visual result was wide spread auroras being seen over many countries near Earth's magnetic poles.  Captured over Kiruna, Sweden, the image features an unusually straight auroral curtain with the green color emitted low in the Earth's atmosphere, and red many kilometers higher up. It is unclear where the rare purple aurora originates, but it might involve an unusual blue aurora at an even lower altitude than the green, seen superposed with a much higher red.  Now past Solar Minimum, colorful nights of auroras over Earth are likely to increase.

Meteor Fireballs in Light and Sound,"Yes, but have you ever heard a meteor? Usually, meteors are too far away to make any audible sound.  However, a meteor will briefly create an ionization trail that can reflect a distant radio signal. If the geometry is right, you may momentarily hear -- through your radio -- a distant radio station even over static.  In the featured video, the sounds of distant radio transmitters were caught reflecting from large meteor trails by a sensitive radio receiver -- at the same time the bright streaks were captured by an all-sky video camera. In the video, the  bright paths taken by four fireballs across the sky near Lamy, New Mexico, USA, are shown first.  Next, after each static frame, a real-time video captures each meteor streaking across the sky, now paired with the sound recorded from its radio reflection.  Projecting a meteor trail down to the Earth may lead to finding its impact site (if any), while projecting its trail back into the sky may lead to identifying its parent comet or asteroid.

IC 1318: The Butterfly Nebula in Gas and Dust,"In the constellation of the swan near the nebula of the pelican lies the gas cloud of the butterfly next to a star known as the hen.  That star, given the proper name Sadr, is just to the right of the featured frame, but the central Butterfly Nebula, designated IC 1318, is shown in high resolution. The intricate patterns in the bright gas and dark dust are caused by complex interactions between interstellar winds, radiation pressures, magnetic fields, and gravity. The featured telescopic view captures IC 1318's characteristic emission from ionized sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms mapped to the red, green, and blue hues of the popular Hubble Palette.

The Surface of Venus from Venera 14,"If you could stand on Venus -- what would you see?  Pictured is the view from Venera 14, a robotic Soviet lander which parachuted and air-braked down through the thick Venusian atmosphere in March of 1982. The desolate landscape it saw included flat rocks, vast empty terrain, and a featureless sky above Phoebe Regio near Venus' equator. On the lower left is the spacecraft's penetrometer used to make scientific measurements, while the light piece on the right is part of an ejected lens-cap.  Enduring temperatures near 450 degrees Celsius and pressures 75 times that on Earth, the hardened Venera spacecraft lasted only about an hour. Although data from Venera 14 was beamed across the inner Solar System almost 40 years ago, digital processing and merging of Venera's unusual images continues even today.  Recent analyses of infrared measurements taken by ESA's orbiting Venus Express spacecraft indicate that active volcanoes may currently exist on Venus.","surface, venus, venera, stand, pictured, view, robotic, soviet, lander, parachuted, air-braked, thick, venusian, march, desolate, landscape, included, flat, rock, vast, empty, terrain, featureless, phoebe, regio, equator, left, spacecraft, penetrometer, used, make, scientific, measurement, light, piece, right, part, ejected, lens-cap, enduring, temperature, degree, celsius, pressure, time, earth, hardened, lasted, hour, data, beamed, inner, solar, system, year, digital, processing, merging, unusual, image, continues, today, recent, analysis, infrared, taken, orbiting, express, indicate, active, volcano, exist"
Stardust in the Perseus Molecular Cloud,"Clouds of stardust drift through this deep skyscape, across the Perseus molecular cloud some 850 light-years away. Dusty nebulae reflecting light from embedded young stars stand out in the nearly 2 degree wide telescopic field of view. With a characteristic bluish color reflection nebula NGC 1333 is at center, vdB 13 at top right, with rare yellowish reflection nebula vdB 12 near the top of the frame. Stars are forming in the molecular cloud, though most are obscured at visible wavelengths by the pervasive dust. Still, hints of contrasting red emission from Herbig-Haro objects, the jets and shocked glowing gas emanating from recently formed stars, are evident in NGC 1333. The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago. At the estimated distance of the Perseus molecular cloud, this cosmic scene would span about 40 light-years.","stardust, perseus, molecular, cloud, drift, deep, skyscape, light-year, dusty, nebula, reflecting, light, embedded, young, star, stand, degree, wide, telescopic, field, view, characteristic, bluish, color, reflection, center, right, rare, yellowish, frame, forming, obscured, visible, wavelength, pervasive, dust, hint, contrasting, emission, herbig-haro, object, shocked, glowing, emanating, formed, evident, chaotic, environment, similar, year, estimated, distance, cosmic, scene, span"
Central Lagoon in Infrared,"Stars fill this infrared view, spanning 4 light-years across the center of the Lagoon Nebula. Visible light images show the glowing gas and obscuring dust clouds that dominate the scene. But this infrared image, constructed from Hubble Space Telescope data, peers closer to the heart of the active star-forming region revealing newborn stars scattered within, against a crowded field of background stars toward the center of our Milky Way galaxy. This tumultuous stellar nursery's central regions are sculpted and energized by the massive, young Herschel 36, seen as the bright star near center in the field of view. Herschel 36 is actually a multiple system of massive stars. At over 30 times the mass of the Sun and less than 1 million years old, the most massive star in the system should live to a stellar old age of 5 million years. Compare that to the almost 5 billion year old Sun which will evolve into a red giant in only another 5 billion years or so.

The Leo Trio,"This popular group leaps into the early evening sky around the March equinox and the northern hemisphere spring. Famous as the Leo Triplet, the three magnificent galaxies found in the prominent constellation Leo gather here in one astronomical field of view. Crowd pleasers when imaged with even modest telescopes, they can be introduced individually as NGC 3628 (right), M66 (upper left), and M65 (bottom). All three are large spiral galaxies but tend to look dissimilar, because their galactic disks are tilted at different angles to our line of sight. NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, is temptingly seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes cutting across its puffy galactic plane. The disks of M66 and M65 are both inclined enough to show off their spiral structure.  Gravitational interactions between galaxies in the group have left telltale signs, including the tidal tails and warped, inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66. This gorgeous view of the region spans over 1 degree (two full moons) on the sky in a frame that covers over half a million light-years at the trio's estimated distance of 30 million light-years.

The Antikythera Mechanism,"No one knew that 2,000 years ago, the technology existed to build such a device.  The Antikythera mechanism, pictured, is now widely regarded as the first computer. Found at the bottom of the sea aboard a decaying Greek ship, its complexity prompted decades of study, and even today some of its functions likely remain unknown.  X-ray images of the device, however, have confirmed that a main function of its numerous clock-like wheels and gears is to create a portable, hand-cranked, Earth-centered, orrery of the sky, predicting future star and planet locations as well as lunar and solar eclipses.  The corroded core of the Antikythera mechanism's largest gear is featured, spanning about 13 centimeters, while the entire mechanism was 33 centimeters high, making it similar in size to a large book. Recently, modern computer modeling of missing components is allowing for the creation of a more complete replica of this surprising ancient machine.","antikythera, mechanism, knew, year, technology, existed, build, device, pictured, regarded, computer, found, bottom, decaying, greek, ship, complexity, prompted, decade, study, today, function, remain, unknown, x-ray, image, confirmed, main, numerous, clock-like, wheel, gear, create, portable, hand-cranked, earth-centered, orrery, predicting, future, star, planet, location, solar, eclipse, corroded, core, largest, featured, spanning, centimeter, entire, high, making, similar, size, large, book, modern, modeling, missing, component, allowing, creation, complete, replica, surprising, ancient, machine"
From Auriga to Orion,"What's up in the sky from Auriga to Orion? Many of the famous stars and nebulas in this region were captured on 34 separate images, taking over 430 hours of exposure, and digitally combined to reveal the featured image. Starting on the far upper left, toward the constellation of Auriga (the Chariot driver), is the picturesque Flaming Star Nebula (IC 405).  Continuing down along the bright arc of our Milky Way Galaxy, from left to right crossing the constellations of the Twins and the Bull, notable appearing nebulas include the Tadpole, Simeis 147, Monkey Head, Jellyfish, Cone and Rosette nebulas.  In the upper right quadrant of the image, toward the constellation of Orion (the hunter), you can see Sh2-264, the half-circle of Barnard's Loop, and the Horsehead and Orion nebulas. Famous stars in and around Orion include, from left to right, orange Betelgeuse (just right of the image center), blue Bellatrix (just above it), the Orion belt stars of Mintaka, Alnilam, and Alnitak, while bright Rigel appears on the far upper right.

Mars over Duddo Stone Circle,"Why are these large stones here? One the more famous stone circles is the Duddo Five Stones of Northumberland, England.  Set in the open near the top of a modest incline, a short hike across empty fields will bring you to unusual human -sized stones that are unlike anything surrounding them. The grooved, pitted, and deeply weathered surfaces of the soft sandstones are consistent with being placed about 4000 years ago -- but placed for reasons now unknown.  The featured image -- a composite of two consecutive images taken from the same location -- was captured last October under a starry sky when the Earth was passing near Mars, making the red planet unusually large and bright.

Aurorae and Lightning on Jupiter,"Why does so much of Jupiter's lightning occur near its poles? Similar to Earth, Jupiter experiences both aurorae and lightning. Different from Earth, though, Jupiter's lightning usually occurs near its poles -- while much of Earth's lightning occurs near its equator. To help understand the difference, NASA's Juno spacecraft, currently orbiting Jupiter, has observed numerous aurora and lightning events. The featured image, taken by Juno's Stellar Reference Unit camera on 2018 May 24, shows Jupiter's northern auroral oval and several bright dots and streaks. An eye-catching event is shown in the right inset image -- which is a flash of Jupiter's lightning -- one of the closest images of aurora and lightning ever. On Earth (which is much nearer to the Sun than Jupiter), sunlight is bright enough to create, by itself, much stronger atmospheric heating at the equator than the poles, driving turbulence, storms, and lightning. On Jupiter, in contrast, atmospheric heating comes mostly from its interior (as a remnant from its formation), leading to the hypothesis that more intense equatorial sunlight  reduces temperature differences between upper atmospheric levels, hence reducing equatorial lightning-creating storms.

The Medusa Nebula,"Braided and serpentine filaments of glowing gas suggest this nebula's popular name, The Medusa Nebula. Also known as Abell 21, this Medusa is an old planetary nebula some 1,500 light-years away in the constellation Gemini. Like its mythological namesake, the nebula is associated with a dramatic transformation. The planetary nebula phase represents a final stage in the evolution of low mass stars like the sun as they transform themselves from red giants to hot white dwarf stars and in the process shrug off their outer layers. Ultraviolet radiation from the hot star powers the nebular glow. The Medusa's transforming star is the faint one near the center of the overall bright crescent shape. In this deep telescopic view, fainter filaments clearly extend above and right of the bright crescent region. The Medusa Nebula is estimated to be over 4 light-years across.","medusa, nebula, braided, serpentine, filament, glowing, suggest, popular, name, known, planetary, light-year, constellation, gemini, mythological, namesake, associated, dramatic, transformation, phase, represents, final, stage, evolution, mass, star, transform, giant, white, dwarf, process, shrug, outer, layer, ultraviolet, radiation, power, nebular, glow, transforming, faint, center, overall, bright, crescent, shape, deep, telescopic, view, fainter, extend, right, region, estimated"
Exploring the Antennae,"Some 60 million light-years away in the southerly constellation Corvus, two large galaxies are colliding. Stars in the two galaxies, cataloged as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, very rarely collide in the course of the ponderous cataclysm that lasts for hundreds of millions of years. But the galaxies' large clouds of molecular gas and dust often do, triggering furious episodes of star formationi near the center of the cosmic wreckage. Spanning over 500 thousand light-years, this stunning view also reveals new star clusters and matter flung far from the scene of the accident by gravitational tidal forces. The remarkably sharp ground-based image includes narrowband data that highlights the characteristic red glow of atomic hydrogen gas in star-forming regions. The suggestive overall visual appearance of the extended arcing structures gives the galaxy pair its popular name - The Antennae.","exploring, light-year, southerly, constellation, corvus, large, galaxy, colliding, star, cataloged, collide, course, ponderous, cataclysm, last, year, cloud, molecular, dust, triggering, furious, episode, formationi, center, cosmic, wreckage, spanning, stunning, view, reveals, cluster, matter, flung, scene, accident, gravitational, tidal, force, sharp, ground-based, image, includes, data, highlight, characteristic, glow, atomic, hydrogen, star-forming, region, suggestive, overall, visual, appearance, extended, arcing, structure, give, pair, popular, name, antenna"
SuitSat-1: A Spacesuit Floats Free,"A spacesuit floated away from the International Space Station 15 years ago, but no investigation was conducted.  Everyone knew that it was pushed by the space station crew.   Dubbed Suitsat-1, the unneeded Russian Orlan spacesuit filled mostly with old clothes was fitted with a faint radio transmitter and released to orbit the Earth. The suit circled the Earth twice before its radio signal became unexpectedly weak. Suitsat-1 continued to orbit every 90 minutes until it burned up in the Earth's atmosphere after a few weeks.

M64: The Evil Eye Galaxy,"Who knows what evil lurks in the eyes of galaxies? The Hubble knows -- or in the case of spiral galaxy M64 -- is helping to find out. Messier 64, also known as the Evil Eye or Sleeping Beauty Galaxy, may seem to have evil in its eye because all of its stars rotate in the same direction as the interstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, but in the opposite direction in the outer regions. Captured here in great detail by the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, enormous dust clouds obscure the near-side of M64's central region, which are laced with the telltale reddish glow of hydrogen associated with star formation.  M64 lies about 17 million light years away, meaning that the light we see from it today left when the last common ancestor between humans and chimpanzees roamed the Earth.  The dusty eye and bizarre rotation are likely the result of a billion-year-old merger of two different galaxies.","galaxy, know, evil, lurks, hubble, case, spiral, helping, find, messier, known, sleeping, beauty, seem, star, rotate, direction, interstellar, central, region, opposite, outer, captured, great, detail, earth-orbiting, space, telescope, enormous, dust, cloud, obscure, near-side, laced, telltale, reddish, glow, hydrogen, associated, formation, light, year, meaning, today, left, last, common, ancestor, human, chimpanzee, roamed, earth, dusty, bizarre, rotation, likely, result, billion-year-old, merger, different"
Red Sprite Lightning over the Andes,"What are those red filaments in the sky? They are a rarely seen form of lightning confirmed only about 30 years ago: red sprites. Recent research has shown that following a powerful positive cloud-to-ground lightning strike, red sprites may start as 100-meter balls of ionized air that shoot down from about 80-km high at 10 percent the speed of light. They are quickly followed by a group of upward streaking ionized balls. The featured image was taken earlier this year from Las Campanas observatory in Chile over the Andes Mountains in Argentina. Red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are best seen when powerful thunderstorms are visible from the side.

M87's Central Black Hole in Polarized Light,"To play on Carl Sagan’s famous words ""If you wish to make black hole jets, you must first create magnetic fields."" The featured image represents the detected intrinsic spin direction (polarization) of radio waves.  The polarizationi is produced by the powerful magnetic field surrounding the supermassive black hole at the center of elliptical galaxy M87. The radio waves were detected by the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT), which combines data from radio telescopes distributed worldwide.  The polarization structure, mapped using computer generated flow lines, is overlaid on EHT’s famous black hole image, first published in 2019. The full 3-D magnetic field is complex.  Preliminary analyses indicate that parts of the field circle around the black hole along with the accreting matter, as expected.  However, another component seemingly veers vertically away from the black hole.  This component could explain how matter resists falling in and is instead launched into M87’s jet.","central, black, hole, polarized, light, play, carl, sagan, famous, word, wish, make, first, create, magnetic, field, featured, image, represents, detected, intrinsic, spin, direction, polarization, radio, wave, polarizationi, produced, powerful, surrounding, supermassive, center, elliptical, galaxy, event, horizon, telescope, combine, data, distributed, worldwide, structure, mapped, using, computer, generated, flow, line, overlaid, published, full, complex, preliminary, analysis, indicate, part, circle, accreting, matter, expected, component, veers, explain, resists, falling, launched"
Rocket Launch as Seen from the Space Station,"Have you ever seen a rocket launch -- from space?  A close inspection of the featured time-lapse video will reveal a rocket rising to Earth orbit as seen from the International Space Station (ISS).  The Russian Soyuz-FG rocket was launched in November 2018 from the Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, carrying a Progress MS-10 (also 71P) module to bring needed supplies to the ISS.  Highlights in the 90-second video (condensing about 15-minutes) include city lights and clouds visible on the Earth on the lower left, blue and gold bands of atmospheric airglow running diagonally across the center, and distant stars on the upper right that set behind the Earth. A lower stage can be seen falling back to Earth as the robotic supply ship fires its thrusters and begins to close on the ISS, a space laboratory that celebrated its 20th anniversary in 2018. Astronauts who live aboard the Earth-orbiting ISS conduct, among more practical duties, numerous science experiments that expand human knowledge and enable future commercial industry in low Earth orbit.","rocket, launch, seen, space, station, close, inspection, featured, time-lapse, video, reveal, rising, earth, orbit, international, russian, soyuz-fg, launched, baikonur, cosmodrome, kazakhstan, carrying, progress, ms-10, module, bring, needed, supply, highlight, condensing, 15-minutes, include, city, light, cloud, visible, left, blue, gold, band, atmospheric, airglow, running, center, distant, star, upper, right, lower, stage, falling, robotic, ship, fire, thruster, begin, laboratory, celebrated, anniversary, astronaut, live, earth-orbiting, conduct, practical, duty, numerous, science, experiment, expand, human, knowledge, enable, future, commercial, industry"
NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble,"Gorgeous spiral galaxy NGC 3521 is a mere 35 million light-years away, toward the constellation Leo. Relatively bright in planet Earth's sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It's hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait, though. Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars. Remarkably, this deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in gigantic bubble-like shells. The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past.","galaxy, bubble, gorgeous, spiral, light-year, constellation, bright, planet, earth, visible, small, telescope, overlooked, amateur, imagers, favor, hard, overlook, colorful, cosmic, portrait, spanning, sport, characteristic, patchy, irregular, laced, dust, pink, star, forming, region, cluster, young, blue, deep, image, find, embedded, gigantic, bubble-like, shell, tidal, debris, stream, torn, satellite, undergone, merger, distant, past"
Ingenuity on Sol 39,"The Mars Ingenuity Helicopter, all four landing legs down, was captured here on sol 39 (March 30) slung beneath the belly of the Perseverance rover. The near ground level view is a mosaic of images from the WATSON camera on the rover's SHERLOC robotic arm. Near the center of the frame the experimental helicopter is suspended just a few centimeters above the martian surface. Tracks from Perseverance extend beyond the rover's wheels with the rim of Jezero crater visible about 2 kilometers in the distance. Ingenuity has a weight of 1.8 kilograms or 4 pounds on Earth. That corresponds to a weight of 0.68 kilograms or 1.5 pounds on Mars.

"In, Through, and Beyond Saturn's Rings","Four moons are visible on the featured image -- can you find them all? First -- and farthest in the background -- is Titan, the largest moon of Saturn and one of the larger moons in the Solar System.  The dark feature across the top of this perpetually cloudy world is the north polar hood. The next most obvious moon is bright Dione, visible in the foreground, complete with craters and long ice cliffs. Jutting in from the left are several of Saturn's expansive rings, including Saturn's A ring featuring the dark Encke Gap. On the far right, just outside the rings, is Pandora, a moon only 80-kilometers across that helps shepherd Saturn's F ring. The fourth moon?  If you look closely inside Saturn's rings, in the Encke Gap, you will find a speck that is actually Pan. Although one of Saturn's smallest moons at 35-kilometers across, Pan is massive enough to help keep the Encke gap relatively free of ring particles. After more than a decade of exploration and discovery, the Cassini spacecraft ran low on fuel in 2017 and was directed to enter Saturn's atmosphere, where it surely melted.","saturn, ring, moon, visible, featured, image, find, first, farthest, background, largest, larger, solar, system, dark, feature, cloudy, world, north, polar, hood, next, obvious, bright, dione, foreground, complete, crater, long, cliff, jutting, left, several, expansive, including, featuring, encke, right, pandora, 80-kilometers, help, shepherd, fourth, look, speck, smallest, 35-kilometers, massive, enough, keep, free, particle, decade, exploration, discovery, cassini, spacecraft, fuel, directed, atmosphere, melted"
Veil Nebula: Wisps of an Exploded Star,"Wisps like this are all that remain visible of a Milky Way star.  About 7,000 years ago that star exploded in a supernova leaving the Veil Nebula. At the time, the expanding cloud was likely as bright as a crescent Moon, remaining visible for weeks to people living at the dawn of recorded history.  Today, the resulting supernova remnant, also known as the Cygnus Loop, has faded and is now visible only through a small telescope directed toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus). The remaining Veil Nebula is physically huge, however, and even though it lies about 1,400 light-years distant, it covers over five times the size of the full Moon.  The featured picture is a Hubble Space Telescope mosaic of six images together covering a span of only about two light years, a small part of the expansive supernova remnant.

First, physically, to the left of the tree, is the planet Mars. The red planet, which is the new home to NASA's Perseverance rover, remains visible this month at sunset above the western horizon. To the tree's right is the Pleiades, a bright cluster of stars dominated by several bright blue stars. The featured picture is a composite of several separate foreground and background images taken within a few hours of each other, early last month, from the same location on Vinegar Hill in Milford, Nova Scotia, Canada.

Threads of NGC 1947,"Found in far southern skies, deep within the boundaries of the constellation Dorado, NGC 1947 is some 40 million light-years away. In silhouette against starlight, obscuring lanes of cosmic dust thread across the peculiar galaxy's bright central regions. Unlike the rotation of stars, gas, and dust tracing the arms of spiral galaxies, the motions of dust and gas don't follow the motions of stars in NGC 1947 though. Their more complicated disconnected motion suggest this galaxy's visible threads of dust and gas may have come from a donor galaxy, accreted by NGC 1947 during the last 3 billion years or so of the peculiar galaxy's evolution.

Messier 106,"Close to the Great Bear (Ursa Major) and surrounded by the stars of the Hunting Dogs (Canes Venatici), this celestial wonder was discovered in 1781 by the metric French astronomer Pierre Mechain. Later, it was added to the catalog of his friend and colleague Charles Messier as M106. Modern deep telescopic views reveal it to be an island universe - a spiral galaxy around 30 thousand light-years across located only about 21 million light-years beyond the stars of the Milky Way. Along with a bright central core, this stunning galaxy portrait, a composite of image data from amateur and professional telescopes, highlights youthful blue star clusters and reddish stellar nurseries tracing the galaxy's spiral arms. It also shows off remarkable reddish jets of glowing hydrogen gas. In addition to small companion galaxy NGC 4248 at bottom right, background galaxies can be found scattered throughout the frame. M106, also known as NGC 4258, is a nearby example of the Seyfert class of active galaxies, seen across the spectrum from radio to X-rays.

Zodiacal Night,"An intense band of zodiacal light is captured in this serene mountain and night skyscape from April 7. The panoramic view was recorded after three hours of hiking from a vantage looking west after sunset across the Pyrenees in southern France. At 2838 meters altitude, Mont Valier is the tallest peak near center. In the sky above, the familiar stars of Orion and the northern winter Milky Way are approaching the rugged western horizon. At the shoulder of Orion, Betelgeuse is one of three bright yellowish celestial beacons. It forms a triangle with fellow red giant star Aldebaran located below Betelgeuse and to the right, and the red planet Mars.

When Black Holes Collide,"What happens when two black holes collide? This extreme scenario occurs in the centers of many merging galaxies and multiple star systems. The featured video shows a computer animation of the final stages of such a merger, while highlighting the gravitational lensing effects that would appear on a background starfield. The black regions indicate the event horizons of the dynamic duo, while a surrounding ring of shifting background stars indicates the position of their combined Einstein ring. All background stars not only have images visible outside of this Einstein ring, but also have one or more companion images visible on the inside. Eventually the two black holes coalesce.  The end stages of such a merger is now known to produce a strong blast of gravitational radiation, providing a new way to see our universe.

Alnitak and the Flame Nebula,"What lights up the Flame Nebula?  Fifteen hundred light years away towards the constellation of Orion lies a nebula which, from its glow and dark dust lanes, appears, on the left, like a billowing fire.  But fire, the rapid acquisition of oxygen, is not what makes this Flame glow.  Rather the bright star Alnitak, the easternmost star in the Belt of Orion visible on the far left, shines energetic light into the Flame that knocks electrons away from the great clouds of hydrogen gas that reside there.  Much of the glow results when the electrons and ionized hydrogen recombine.  The featured picture of the Flame Nebula (NGC 2024) was taken across three visible color bands with detail added by a long duration exposure taken in light emitted only by hydrogen.  The Flame Nebula is part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, a star-forming region that includes the famous Horsehead Nebula.","alnitak, flame, nebula, light, fifteen, year, constellation, orion, glow, dark, dust, lane, appears, left, billowing, fire, rapid, acquisition, oxygen, make, bright, star, belt, visible, shine, energetic, knock, electron, great, cloud, hydrogen, result, ionized, recombine, featured, picture, taken, color, band, detail, added, long, duration, exposure, emitted, part, molecular, complex, star-forming, region, includes, famous, horsehead"
Confirmed Muon Wobble Remains Unexplained,"How fast do elementary particles wobble?  A surprising answer to this seemingly inconsequential question came out of Brookhaven National Laboratory in New York, USA in 2001, and indicated that the Standard Model of Particle Physics, adopted widely in physics, is incomplete. Specifically, the muon, a particle with similarities to a heavy electron, has had its relatively large wobble under scrutiny in a series of experiments known as g-2 (gee-minus-two). The Brookhaven result galvanized other experimental groups around the world to confirm it, and pressured theorists to better understand it.  Reporting in last week, the most sensitive muon wobble experiment yet, conducted at Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory (Fermilab) in Illinois and pictured here, agreed with the Brookhaven result. The unexpected wobble rate may indicate that an ever-present sea of  virtual particles includes types not currently known.  Alternatively, it may indicate that flaws exist in difficult theoretical prediction calculations. Future runs at Fermilab's g-2 experiment will further increase precision and, possibly, the statistical difference between the universe we measure and the universe we understand.","confirmed, muon, wobble, remains, unexplained, elementary, particle, surprising, answer, inconsequential, question, came, brookhaven, national, laboratory, york, indicated, standard, model, physic, adopted, incomplete, similarity, heavy, electron, large, scrutiny, series, experiment, known, gee-minus-two, result, galvanized, experimental, group, world, confirm, pressured, theorist, understand, reporting, last, week, sensitive, conducted, fermi, accelerator, fermilab, illinois, pictured, agreed, unexpected, rate, indicate, ever-present, virtual, includes, type, flaw, exist, difficult, theoretical, prediction, calculation, future, increase, precision, statistical, difference, universe, measure"
The Pencil Nebula Supernova Shock Wave,"This supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour. Near the middle and moving up in this sharply detailed color composite, thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples in a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on. Cataloged as NGC 2736, its elongated appearance suggests its popular name, the Pencil Nebula. The Pencil Nebula is about 5 light-years long and 800 light-years away, but represents only a small part of the Vela supernova remnant. The Vela remnant itself is around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding debris cloud of a star that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago. Initially, the shock wave was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up surrounding interstellar material. In the featured narrow-band, wide field image, red and blue colors track, primarily, the characteristic glows of ionized hydrogen and oxygen atoms, respectively.

"The Galaxy, the Jet, and a Famous Black Hole","Bright elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87) is home to the supermassive black hole captured by planet Earth's Event Horizon Telescope in the first ever image of a black hole. Giant of the Virgo galaxy cluster about 55 million light-years away, M87 is the large galaxy rendered in blue hues in this infrared image from the Spitzer Space telescope.  Though M87 appears mostly featureless and cloud-like, the Spitzer image does record details of relativistic jets blasting from the galaxy's central region. Shown in the inset at top right, the jets themselves span thousands of light-years. The brighter jet seen on the right is approaching and close to our line of sight. Opposite, the shock created by the otherwise unseen receding jet lights up a fainter arc of material. Inset at bottom right, the historic black hole image is shown in context, at the center of giant galaxy and relativistic jets. Completely unresolved in the Spitzer image, the supermassive black hole surrounded by infalling material is the source of enormous energy driving the relativistic jets from the center of active galaxy M87.","galaxy, famous, black, hole, bright, elliptical, messier, home, supermassive, captured, planet, earth, event, horizon, telescope, image, giant, virgo, cluster, light-year, large, rendered, blue, infrared, spitzer, space, appears, featureless, cloud-like, record, detail, relativistic, blasting, central, region, shown, inset, right, span, brighter, seen, approaching, close, line, sight, opposite, shock, created, unseen, receding, light, fainter, material, bottom, historic, context, center, unresolved, surrounded, infalling, source, enormous, energy, driving, active"
The Doubly Warped World of Binary Black Holes,"Light rays from accretion disks around a pair of orbiting supermassive black holes make their way through the warped space-time produced by extreme gravity in this stunning computer visualization. The simulated accretion disks have been given different false color schemes, red for the disk surrounding a 200-million-solar-mass black hole, and blue for the disk surrounding a 100-million-solar-mass black hole. That makes it easier to track the light sources, but the choice also reflects reality. Hotter gas gives off light closer to the blue end of the spectrum and material orbiting smaller black holes experiences stronger gravitational effects that produce higher temperatures. For these masses, both accretion disks would actually emit most of their light in the ultraviolet though. In the video, distorted secondary images of the blue black hole, which show the red black hole's view of its partner, can be found within the tangled skein of the red disk warped by the gravity of the blue black hole in the foreground. Because we're seeing red's view of blue while also seeing blue directly, the images allow us to see both sides of blue at the same time. Red and blue light originating from both black holes can be seen in the innermost ring of light, called the photon ring, near their event horizons. Astronomers expect that in the not-too-distant future they’ll be able to detect gravitational waves, ripples in space-time, produced when two supermassive black holes in a system much like the one simulated here spiral together and merge.","warped, world, binary, black, hole, light, accretion, disk, pair, orbiting, supermassive, make, produced, extreme, gravity, stunning, computer, visualization, simulated, given, different, false, color, scheme, surrounding, 200-million-solar-mass, blue, 100-million-solar-mass, easier, track, source, choice, reflects, reality, hotter, give, closer, spectrum, material, smaller, experience, stronger, gravitational, effect, produce, higher, temperature, mass, emit, ultraviolet, video, distorted, secondary, image, show, view, partner, found, tangled, skein, foreground, seeing, allow, side, time, originating, seen, innermost, ring, called, photon, event, horizon, astronomer, expect, not-too-distant, future, able, detect, wave, ripple, space-time, system, much, spiral, merge"
Inside the Flame Nebula,"The Flame Nebula is a stand out in optical images of the dusty, crowded star forming regions toward Orion's belt and the easternmost belt star Alnitak, a mere 1,400 light-years away. Alnitak is the bright star at the right edge of this infrared image from the Spitzer Space Telescope. About 15 light-years across, the infrared view takes you inside the nebula's glowing gas and obscuring dust clouds though. It reveals many stars of the recently formed, embedded cluster NGC 2024 concentrated near the center. The stars of NGC 2024 range in age from 200,000 years to 1.5 million years young. In fact, data indicate that the youngest stars are concentrated near the middle of the Flame Nebula cluster. That's the opposite of the simplest models of star formation for a stellar nursery that predict star formation begins in the denser center of a molecular cloud core. The result requires a more complex model for star formation inside the Flame Nebula.","flame, nebula, stand, optical, image, dusty, crowded, star, forming, region, orion, belt, alnitak, light-year, bright, right, edge, infrared, spitzer, space, telescope, view, take, glowing, obscuring, dust, cloud, reveals, many, formed, embedded, cluster, concentrated, center, range, year, young, fact, data, indicate, youngest, middle, opposite, simplest, model, formation, stellar, nursery, predict, denser, molecular, core, result, requires, complex"
Rainbow Airglow over the Azores,"Why would the sky glow like a giant repeating rainbow?  Airglow.  Now air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth's atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  The long-duration exposure nearly along the vertical walls of airglow likely made the undulating structure particularly visible.  OK, but where do the colors originate?  The deep red glow likely originates from OH molecules about 87-kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun. The orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  The featured image was captured during a climb up Mount Pico in the Azores of Portugal.  Ground lights originate from the island of Faial in the Atlantic Ocean.

A mosaic of many smaller snapshots, the detailed, false-color image shows older, cool stars in bluish hues. Red and brown glowing dust clouds are associated with young, hot stars in stellar nurseries. The very center of the Milky Way has recently been found capable of forming newborn stars.

Ingenuity: First Flight over Mars,"What's the best way to explore Mars? Perhaps there is no single best way, but a newly demonstrated method shows tremendous promise: flight. Powered flight has the promise to search vast regions and scout out particularly interesting areas for more detailed investigation.  Yesterday, for the first time, powered flight was demonstrated on Mars by a small helicopter named Ingenuity.  In the featured video, Ingenuity is first imaged by the Perseverance rover sitting quietly on the Martian surface.  After a few seconds, Ingenuity's long rotors begin to spin, and a few seconds after that -- history is made as Ingenuity actually takes off, hovers for a few seconds, and then lands safely.  More tests of Ingenuity's unprecedented ability are planned over the next few months.  Flight may help humanity better explore not only Mars, but Saturn's moon Titan over the next few decades.","ingenuity, flight, best, single, demonstrated, method, show, tremendous, promise, powered, search, vast, region, interesting, area, detailed, investigation, yesterday, first, time, small, helicopter, named, featured, video, imaged, perseverance, rover, sitting, martian, surface, second, long, rotor, begin, spin, history, made, take, hovers, land, test, unprecedented, ability, planned, next, month, help, humanity, saturn, moon, titan, decade"
Centaurus A's Warped Magnetic Fields,"When galaxies collide -- what happens to their magnetic fields? To help find out, NASA pointed SOFIA, its flying 747, at galactic neighbor Centaurus A to observe the emission of polarized dust -- which traces magnetic fields.  Cen A's unusual shape results from the clash of two galaxies with jets powered by gas accreting onto a central supermassive black hole.  In the resulting featured image, SOFIA-derived magnetic streamlines are superposed on ESO (visible: white), APEX (submillimeter: orange), Chandra (X-rays: blue), and Spitzer (infrared: red) images. The magnetic fields were found to be parallel to the dust lanes on the outskirts of the galaxy but distorted near the center.  Gravitational forces near the black hole accelerate ions and enhance the magnetic field.  In sum, the collision not only combined the galaxies’ masses -- but amplified their magnetic fields.  These results provide new insights into how magnetic fields evolved in the early universe when mergers were more common.","centaurus, warped, magnetic, field, galaxy, collide, happens, help, find, nasa, pointed, sofia, flying, galactic, neighbor, observe, emission, polarized, dust, trace, unusual, shape, result, clash, powered, accreting, central, supermassive, black, hole, resulting, featured, image, sofia-derived, streamlines, superposed, visible, white, apex, submillimeter, orange, chandra, x-ray, blue, spitzer, infrared, found, lane, outskirt, distorted, center, gravitational, force, accelerate, enhance, collision, combined, mass, amplified, provide, insight, evolved, early, universe, merger, common"
Planet Earth at Twilight,"No sudden, sharp boundary marks the passage of day into night in this gorgeous view of ocean and clouds over our fair planet Earth. Instead, the shadow line or terminator is diffuse and shows the gradual transition to darkness we experience as twilight. With the Sun illuminating the scene from the right, the cloud tops reflect gently reddened sunlight filtered through the dusty troposphere, the lowest layer of the planet's nurturing atmosphere. A clear high altitude layer, visible along the dayside's upper edge, scatters blue sunlight and fades into the blackness of space. This picture was taken in June of 2001 from the International Space Station orbiting at an altitude of 211 nautical miles. But you can check out the vital signs of Planet Earth Now.

Flying Over the Earth at Night II,"Recorded during 2017, timelapse sequences from the International Space Station are compiled in this serene video of planet Earth at Night. Fans of low Earth orbit can start by enjoying the view as green and red aurora borealis slather up the sky. The night scene tracks from northwest to southeast across North America, toward the Gulf of Mexico and the Florida coast. A second sequence follows European city lights, crosses the Mediterranean Sea, and passes over a bright Nile river in northern Africa. Seen from the orbital outpost, erratic flashes of lightning appear in thunder storms below and stars rise above the planet's curved horizon through a faint atmospheric airglow. Of course, from home you can always check out the vital signs of Planet Earth Now.

Streak and Plume from SpaceX Crew-2 Launch,"What's happening in the sky?  The pre-dawn sky first seemed relatively serene yesterday morning over Indian Harbor Beach in Florida, USA. But then it lit up with a rocket launch.  Just to the north, NASA's SpaceX Crew-2 Mission blasted into space aboard a powerful Falcon 9 rocket. The featured time-lapse video -- compressing 12-minutes into 8-seconds -- shows the bright launch plume starting on the far left.  The rocket rises into an increasingly thin atmosphere, causing its plume to spread out just as it is lit by the rising Sun. As the Crew-2 capsule disappears over the horizon, the landing plume of the returning first stage of the Falcon 9 descending toward the SpaceX barge in the Atlantic Ocean can be seen.  Up in space, the Endeavour crew capsule is expected to dock with the International Space Station (ISS) this morning, delivering four astronauts. The Crew-2 astronauts join Expedition 65 to help conduct, among other tasks, drug tests using tissue chips -- small microfluidic chips that simulate human organs -- that run rapidly in ISS's microgravity.","streak, plume, spacex, crew-2, launch, happening, pre-dawn, seemed, serene, yesterday, morning, indian, harbor, beach, florida, rocket, north, nasa, mission, blasted, space, aboard, powerful, falcon, featured, time-lapse, video, compressing, 12-minutes, 8-seconds, show, bright, starting, left, rise, thin, causing, spread, rising, capsule, disappears, horizon, landing, returning, first, stage, descending, barge, atlantic, ocean, seen, endeavour, crew, expected, dock, international, station, delivering, astronaut, join, expedition, help, conduct, task, drug, test, using, tissue, chip, small, microfluidic, simulate, human, organ, microgravity"
Planetary Nebula Mz3: The Ant Nebula,"Why isn't this ant a big sphere?  Planetary nebula Mz3 is being cast off by a star similar to our Sun that is, surely, round.  Why then would the gas that is streaming away create an ant-shaped nebula that is distinctly not round?  Clues might include the high 1000-kilometer per second speed of the expelled gas, the light-year long length of the structure, and the magnetism of the star featured here at the nebula's center.  One possible answer is that Mz3 is hiding a second, dimmer star that orbits close in to the bright star.  A competing hypothesis holds that the central star's own spin and magnetic field are channeling the gas.  Since the central star appears to be so similar to our own Sun, astronomers hope that increased understanding of the history of this giant space ant can provide useful insight into the likely future of our own Sun and Earth.","planetary, nebula, sphere, cast, star, similar, round, streaming, create, ant-shaped, clue, include, high, 1000-kilometer, second, speed, expelled, light-year, long, length, structure, magnetism, featured, center, possible, answer, hiding, dimmer, orbit, close, bright, competing, hypothesis, hold, central, spin, magnetic, field, channeling, appears, hope, increased, understanding, history, giant, space, provide, useful, insight, likely, future, earth"
A Sagittarius Triplet,"These three bright nebulae are often featured on telescopic tours of the constellation Sagittarius and the crowded starfields of the central Milky Way. In fact, 18th century cosmic tourist Charles Messier cataloged two of them; M8, the large nebula below and right of center, and colorful M20 near the top of the frame. The third emission region includes NGC 6559, left of M8 and separated from the larger nebula by a dark dust lane. All three are stellar nurseries about five thousand light-years or so distant. Over a hundred light-years across the expansive M8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. M20's popular moniker is the Trifid. Glowing hydrogen gas creates the dominant red color of the emission nebulae. But for striking contrast, blue hues in the Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight. The broad interstellarscape spans almost 4 degrees or 8 full moons on the sky.","sagittarius, triplet, bright, featured, telescopic, tour, constellation, crowded, starfields, central, milky, fact, 18th, century, cosmic, tourist, charles, cataloged, large, right, center, colorful, frame, third, emission, region, includes, left, separated, larger, nebula, dark, dust, lane, stellar, thousand, light-year, distant, hundred, expansive, known, lagoon, popular, moniker, trifid, glowing, hydrogen, creates, dominant, color, striking, contrast, blue, reflected, starlight, broad, interstellarscape, span, degree, full, moon"
Animation: Black Hole Destroys Star,"What happens if a star gets too close to a black hole? The black hole can rip it apart -- but how? It's not the high gravitational attraction itself that's the problem -- it's the difference in gravitational pull across the star that creates the destruction.  In the featured animated video illustrating this disintegration, you first see a star approaching the black hole.  Increasing in orbital speed, the star's outer atmosphere is ripped away during closest approach.  Much of the star's atmosphere disperses into deep space, but some continues to orbit the black hole and forms an accretion disk. The animation then takes you into the accretion disk while looking toward the black hole. Including the strange visual effects of gravitational lensing, you can even see the far side of the disk.  Finally, you look along one of the jets being expelled along the spin axis.  Theoretical models indicate that these jets not only expel energetic gas, but create energetic neutrinos -- one of which may have been seen recently on Earth.","animation, black, hole, destroys, star, happens, close, high, gravitational, attraction, problem, difference, pull, creates, destruction, featured, animated, video, illustrating, disintegration, approaching, increasing, orbital, speed, outer, ripped, closest, approach, much, atmosphere, disperses, deep, space, continues, orbit, form, accretion, disk, take, looking, including, strange, visual, effect, lensing, side, look, expelled, spin, axis, theoretical, model, indicate, expel, energetic, create, neutrino, seen, earth"
North Star: Polaris and Surrounding Dust,"Why is Polaris called the North Star? First, Polaris is the nearest bright star toward the north spin axis of the Earth.  Therefore, as the Earth turns, stars appear to revolve around Polaris, but Polaris itself always stays in the same northerly direction -- making it the North Star.  Since no bright star is near the south spin axis of the Earth, there is currently no South Star.  Thousands of years ago, Earth's spin axis pointed in a slightly different direction so that Vega was the North Star.  Although Polaris is not the brightest star on the sky, it is easily located because it is nearly aligned with two stars in the cup of the Big Dipper. Polaris is near the center of the eight-degree wide featured image, an image that has been digitally manipulated to suppress surrounding dim stars but accentuate the faint gas and dust of the Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN).  The surface of Cepheid Polaris slowly pulsates, causing the star to change its brightness by a few percent over the course of a few days.

Apollo 17: The Crescent Earth,"Our fair planet sports a curved, sunlit crescent against the black backdrop of space in this stunning photograph. From the unfamiliar perspective, the Earth is small and, like a telescopic image of a distant planet, the entire horizon is completely within the field of view. Enjoyed by crews on board the International Space Station, only much closer views of the planet are possible from low Earth orbit. Orbiting the planet once every 90 minutes, a spectacle of clouds, oceans, and continents scrolls beneath them with the partial arc of the planet's edge in the distance. But this digitally restored image presents a view so far only achieved by 24 humans, Apollo astronauts who traveled to the Moon and back again between 1968 and 1972. The original photograph, AS17-152-23420, was taken by the homeward bound crew of Apollo 17, on December 17, 1972. For now it's the last picture of Earth from this planetary perspective taken by human hands.   - NASA Remembers Michael Collins -","crescent, earth, fair, planet, sport, curved, sunlit, black, backdrop, space, stunning, photograph, unfamiliar, perspective, small, telescopic, image, distant, entire, horizon, field, view, enjoyed, crew, board, international, station, possible, orbit, orbiting, minute, spectacle, cloud, ocean, continent, scroll, beneath, partial, edge, distance, restored, present, achieved, human, apollo, astronaut, traveled, moon, original, as17-152-23420, taken, homeward, bound, december, last, picture, planetary, hand, nasa, remembers, michael, collins"
Pink and the Perigee Moon,"On April 25 a nearly full moon rose just before sunset. Welcomed in a clear blue sky and framed by cherry blossoms, its familiar face was captured in this snapshot from Leith, Edinburgh, Scotland. Known to some as a Pink Moon, April's full lunar phase occurred with the moon near perigee. That's the closest point in its not-quite-circular orbit around planet Earth, making this Pink Moon one of the closest and brightest full moons of the year. If you missed it, don't worry. Your next chance to see a full perigee moon will be on May 26. Known to some as a Flower Moon, May's full moon will actually be closer to you than April's by about 98 miles (158 kilometers), or about 0.04% the distance from the Earth to the Moon at perigee.","pink, perigee, moon, april, full, rose, sunset, welcomed, clear, blue, framed, cherry, blossom, familiar, face, captured, snapshot, leith, edinburgh, scotland, known, lunar, phase, occurred, closest, point, not-quite-circular, orbit, planet, earth, making, year, missed, worry, next, chance, flower, mile, kilometer, distance"
Perseverance from Ingenuity,"Flying at an altitude of 5 meters (just over 16 feet), on April 25 the Ingenuity helicopter snapped this sharp image. On its second flight above the surface of Mars, its color camera was looking back toward Ingenuity's current base at Wright Brothers Field and Octavia E. Butler Landing marked by the tracks of the Perseverance rover at the top of the frame. Perseverance itself looks on from the upper left corner about 85 meters away. Tips of Ingenuity's landing legs just peek over the left and right edges of the camera's field of view. Its record setting fourth flight completed on April 30, Ingenuity collected images of a potential new landing zone before returning to Wright Brothers Field.

Clouds of the Carina Nebula,"What forms lurk in the mists of the Carina Nebula? The dark ominous figures are actually molecular clouds, knots of molecular gas and dust so thick they have become opaque.  In comparison, however,  these clouds are typically much less dense than Earth's atmosphere.  Featured here is a detailed image of the core of the Carina Nebula, a part where both dark and colorful clouds of gas and dust are particularly prominent.  The image was captured in mid-2016 from Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.  Although the nebula is predominantly composed of hydrogen gas -- here colored green, the image was assigned colors so that light emitted by trace amounts of sulfur and oxygen appear red and blue, respectively.  The entire Carina Nebula, cataloged as NGC 3372, spans over 300 light years and lies about 7,500 light-years away in the constellation of Carina. Eta Carinae, the most energetic star in the nebula, was one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then faded dramatically.","cloud, carina, nebula, form, lurk, mist, dark, ominous, figure, molecular, knot, dust, thick, become, opaque, comparison, less, dense, earth, atmosphere, featured, detailed, image, core, part, colorful, prominent, captured, mid-2016, siding, spring, observatory, composed, hydrogen, colored, green, assigned, color, light, emitted, trace, amount, sulfur, oxygen, appear, blue, entire, cataloged, span, year, light-year, constellation, energetic, star, brightest, faded"
"Apollo 11: Earth, Moon, Spaceship","After the most famous voyage of modern times, it was time to go home. After proving that humanity has the ability to go beyond the confines of planet Earth, the first humans to walk on another world -- Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin -- flew the ascent stage of their Lunar Module back to meet Michael Collins in the moon-orbiting Command and Service Module. Pictured here on 1969 July 21 and recently digitally restored, the ascending spaceship was captured by Collins making its approach, with the Moon below, and Earth far in the distance.  The smooth, dark area on the lunar surface is Mare Smythii located just below the equator on the extreme eastern edge of the Moon's near side.

"Space Station, Solar Prominences, Sun","That's no sunspot. It's the International Space Station (ISS) caught passing in front of the Sun. Sunspots, individually, have a dark central umbra, a lighter surrounding penumbra, and no Dragon capsules attached.  By contrast, the ISS is a complex and multi-spired mechanism, one of the largest and most complicated spacecraft ever created by humanity.  Also, sunspots circle the Sun, whereas the ISS orbits the Earth.  Transiting the Sun is not very unusual for the ISS, which orbits the Earth about every 90 minutes, but getting one's location, timing and equipment just right for a great image is rare.  The featured picture combined three images all taken from the same location and at nearly the same time. One image -- overexposed -- captured the faint prominences seen across the top of the Sun, a second image -- underexposed -- captured the complex texture of the Sun's chromosphere, while the third image -- the hardest to get -- captured the space station as it shot across the Sun in a fraction of a second.

STEVE over Copper Harbor,"What creates STEVEs? Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancements (STEVEs) have likely been seen since antiquity, but only in the past five years has it been realized that their colors and shapes make them different from auroras. Seen as single bright streaks of pink and purple, the origin of STEVEs remain an active topic of research. STEVEs may be related to subauroral ion drifts (SAIDs), a supersonic river of hot atmospheric ions. For reasons currently unknown, STEVEs are frequently accompanied by green ""picket-fence"" auroras. The featured STEVE image is a combination of foreground and background exposures taken consecutively in mid-March from Copper Harbor, Michigan, USA. This bright STEVE lasted several minutes, spanned from horizon to horizon, and appeared in between times of normal auroras.","steve, copper, harbor, creates, steves, strong, thermal, emission, velocity, enhancement, likely, seen, antiquity, year, realized, color, shape, make, different, aurora, single, bright, streak, pink, purple, origin, remain, active, topic, research, related, subauroral, drift, saids, supersonic, river, atmospheric, reason, unknown, accompanied, green, picket-fence, featured, image, combination, foreground, background, exposure, taken, mid-march, michigan, lasted, several, minute, spanned, horizon, appeared, time, normal"
Windblown NGC 3199,"NGC 3199 lies about 12,000 light-years away, a glowing cosmic cloud in the nautical southern constellation of Carina. The nebula is about 75 light-years across in this narrowband, false-color view.  Though the deep image reveals a more or less complete bubble shape, it does look very lopsided with a much brighter edge along the top. Near the center is a Wolf-Rayet star, a massive, hot, short-lived star that generates an intense stellar wind. In fact, Wolf-Rayet stars are known to create nebulae with interesting shapes as their powerful winds sweep up surrounding interstellar material. In this case, the bright edge was thought to indicate a bow shock produced as the star plowed through a uniform medium, like a boat through water. But measurements have shown the star is not really moving directly toward the bright edge. So a more likely explanation is that the material surrounding the star is not uniform, but clumped and denser near the bright edge of windblown NGC 3199.","light-year, glowing, cosmic, cloud, nautical, southern, constellation, carina, narrowband, false-color, view, deep, image, reveals, complete, bubble, shape, look, lopsided, brighter, edge, center, wolf-rayet, star, massive, short-lived, generates, intense, stellar, wind, fact, known, create, nebula, interesting, powerful, sweep, surrounding, interstellar, material, case, bright, thought, indicate, shock, produced, plowed, uniform, medium, boat, water, measurement, shown, moving, likely, explanation, clumped, denser, windblown"
Mercury-Redstone 3 Launch,"Sixty years ago, near the dawn of the space age, NASA controllers ""lit the candle"" and sent Mercury astronaut Alan Shepard arcing into space atop a Redstone rocket. His cramped space capsule was dubbed Freedom 7. Broadcast live to a global television audience, the historic Mercury-Redstone 3 (MR-3) spacecraft was launched from Cape Canaveral Florida at 9:34 a.m. Eastern Time on May 5, 1961. The flight of Freedom 7, the first space flight by an American, followed less than a month after the first human venture into space by Soviet Cosmonaut Yuri Gagarin. The 15 minute sub-orbital flight achieved an altitude of 116 miles and a maximum speed of 5,134 miles per hour. As Shepard looked back near the peak of Freedom 7's trajectory, he could see the outlines of the west coast of Florida, Lake Okeechobe in central Florida, the Gulf of Mexico, and the Bahamas. Shepard would later view planet Earth from a more distant perspective and walk on the Moon as commander of the Apollo 14 mission.","mercury-redstone, launch, year, dawn, space, nasa, controller, candle, sent, mercury, astronaut, alan, arcing, redstone, rocket, cramped, capsule, dubbed, broadcast, live, global, television, audience, historic, mr-3, spacecraft, launched, cape, canaveral, florida, eastern, time, flight, freedom, first, american, followed, month, human, venture, soviet, cosmonaut, yuri, gagarin, minute, sub-orbital, achieved, mile, maximum, speed, hour, shepard, looked, peak, trajectory, outline, west, coast, lake, okeechobe, central, gulf, mexico, bahamas, view, planet, earth, distant, perspective, walk, moon, commander, apollo, mission"
Deepscape at Yacoraite,"In this evocative night scene a dusty central Milky Way rises over the ancient Andean archaeological site of Yacoraite in northwestern Argentina. The denizens of planet Earth reaching skyward are the large Argentine saguaro cactus currently native to the arid region. The unusual yellow-hued reflection nebula above is created by dust scattering starlight around red giant star Antares. Alpha star of the constellation Scorpius, Antares is over 500 light-years distant. Next to it bright blue Rho Ophiuchi is embedded in more typical dusty bluish reflection nebulae though. The deep night skyscape was created from a series of background exposures of the rising stars made while tracking the sky, and a foreground exposure of the landscape made with the camera and lens fixed on the tripod.

Adrift 1,500 light-years away in one of the night sky's most recognizable constellations, they appear in opposite corners of the above stunning mosaic. The familiar Horsehead nebula appears as a dark cloud, a small silhouette notched against the long red glow at the lower left. Alnitak is the easternmost star in Orion's belt and is seen as the brightest star to the left of the Horsehead. Below Alnitak is the Flame Nebula, with clouds of bright emission and dramatic dark dust lanes. The magnificent emission region, the Orion Nebula (aka M42), lies at the upper right.

Star Clusters M35 and NGC 2158,"Clusters of stars can be near or far, young or old, diffuse or compact.  The featured image shows two quite contrasting open star clusters in the same field. M35, on the lower left, is relatively nearby at 2800 light years distant, relatively young at 150 million years old, and relatively diffuse, with about 2500 stars spread out over a volume 30 light years across.  Bright blue stars frequently distinguish younger open clusters like M35. Contrastingly, NGC 2158, on the upper right, is four times more distant than M35, over 10 times older, and much more compact.  NGC 2158's bright blue stars have self-destructed, leaving cluster light to be dominated by older and yellower stars.  In general, open star clusters are found in the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, and contain anywhere from 100 to 10,000 stars -- all of which formed at nearly the same time.

Lightning and Orion Beyond Uluru,"What's happening behind Uluru?  A United Nations World Heritage Site, Uluru  is an extraordinary 350-meter high mountain in central Australia that rises sharply from nearly flat surroundings. Composed of sandstone, Uluru has slowly formed over the past 300 million years as softer rock eroded away.  In the background of the featured image taken in mid-May, a raging thunderstorm is visible.  Far behind both Uluru and the thunderstorm is a star-filled sky highlighted by the constellation of Orion. The Uluru region has been a home to humans for over 22,000 years.

A Meteor and the Gegenschein,"Is the night sky darkest in the direction opposite the Sun? No. In fact, a rarely discernable faint glow known as the gegenschein (German for ""counter glow"") can be seen 180 degrees around from the Sun in an extremely  dark sky. The gegenschein is sunlight back-scattered off small interplanetary dust particles.  These dust particles are millimeter sized splinters from asteroids and orbit in the ecliptic plane of the planets.  Pictured here from last March is one of the more spectacular pictures of the gegenschein yet taken. The deep exposure of an extremely dark sky over Teide Observatory in Spain's Canary Islands shows the gegenschein as part of extended zodiacal light.  Notable background objects include a bright meteor (on the left), the Big Dipper (top right), and Polaris (far right).  The meteor nearly points toward Mount Teide, Spain's highest mountain, while the Pyramid solar laboratory is visible on the right.

Captured at its position on May 5, the comet was within the boundaries of northern constellation Canes Venatici (the Hunting Dogs), and near the line-of-sight to intriguing background galaxies popularly known as the Whale and the Hockey Stick. Cetacean in appearance but Milky Way sized, NGC 4631 is a spiral galaxy seen edge-on at the top right, some 25 million light-years away. NGC 4656/7 sports the bent-stick shape of interacting galaxies below and left of NGC 4631. In fact, the distortions and mingling trails of gas detected at other wavelengths suggest the cosmic Whale and Hockey Stick have had close encounters with each other in their distant past. Outbound and only about 7 light-minutes from Earth this Comet ATLAS should revisit the inner solar system in just under 1,000 years.","comet, whale, hockey, stick, closest, march, planet, earth, april, atlas, c/2020, show, faint, greenish, coma, short, tail, telescopic, field, view, captured, position, boundary, northern, constellation, cane, venatici, hunting, line-of-sight, intriguing, background, galaxy, known, cetacean, appearance, milky, sized, spiral, seen, edge-on, right, light-year, sport, bent-stick, shape, interacting, left, fact, distortion, mingling, trail, detected, wavelength, suggest, cosmic, close, encounter, distant, light-minutes, revisit, inner, solar, system, year"
M104: The Sombrero Galaxy,"A gorgeous spiral galaxy, M104 is famous for its nearly edge-on profile featuring a broad ring of obscuring dust lanes. Seen in silhouette against an extensive central bulge of stars, the swath of cosmic dust lends a broad brimmed hat-like appearance to the galaxy suggesting a more popular moniker, the Sombrero Galaxy. This sharp optical view of the well-known galaxy made from ground-based image data was processed to preserve details often lost in overwhelming glare of M104's bright central bulge. Also known as NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy can be seen across the spectrum, and is host to a central supermassive black hole. About 50,000 light-years across and 28 million light-years away, M104 is one of the largest galaxies at the southern edge of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster. Still the colorful spiky foreground stars in this field of view lie well within our own Milky Way galaxy.","m104, sombrero, galaxy, gorgeous, spiral, famous, edge-on, profile, featuring, broad, ring, obscuring, dust, lane, seen, silhouette, extensive, central, bulge, star, swath, cosmic, lends, brimmed, hat-like, appearance, suggesting, popular, moniker, sharp, optical, view, well-known, made, ground-based, image, data, processed, preserve, detail, lost, overwhelming, glare, bright, known, spectrum, host, supermassive, black, hole, light-year, largest, southern, edge, virgo, cluster, colorful, spiky, foreground, field, milky"
The Southern Cliff in the Lagoon,"Undulating bright ridges and dusty clouds cross this close-up of the nearby star forming region M8, also known as the Lagoon Nebula. A sharp, false-color composite of narrow band visible and broad band near-infrared data from the 8-meter Gemini South Telescope, the entire view spans about 20 light-years through a region of the nebula sometimes called the Southern Cliff. The highly detailed image explores the association of many newborn stars imbedded in the tips of the bright-rimmed clouds and Herbig-Haro objects. Abundant in star-forming regions, Herbig-Haro objects are produced as powerful jets emitted by young stars in the process of formation heat the surrounding clouds of gas and dust. The cosmic Lagoon is found some 5,000 light-years away toward the constellation Sagittarius and the center of our Milky Way Galaxy.

NGC 602 and Beyond,"The clouds may look like an oyster, and the stars like pearls, but look beyond. Near the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy some 200 thousand light-years distant, lies 5 million year young star cluster NGC 602. Surrounded by natal gas and dust, NGC 602 is featured in this stunning Hubble image of the region. Fantastic ridges and swept back shapes strongly suggest that energetic radiation and shock waves from NGC 602's massive young stars have eroded the dusty material and triggered a progression of star formation moving away from the cluster's center. At the estimated distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud, the featured picture spans about 200 light-years, but a tantalizing assortment of background galaxies are also visible in this sharp multi-colored view. The background galaxies are hundreds of millions of light-years or more beyond NGC 602.","cloud, look, star, pearl, small, magellanic, satellite, galaxy, light-year, distant, year, young, cluster, surrounded, natal, dust, featured, stunning, hubble, image, region, fantastic, ridge, swept, shape, suggest, energetic, radiation, shock, wave, massive, eroded, dusty, material, triggered, progression, formation, moving, center, estimated, distance, picture, span, tantalizing, assortment, background, visible, sharp, multi-colored, view"
NGC 4565: Galaxy on Edge,"Is our Milky Way Galaxy this thin?  Magnificent spiral galaxy NGC 4565 is viewed edge-on from planet Earth. Also known as the Needle Galaxy for its narrow profile, bright NGC 4565 is a stop on many telescopic tours of the northern sky, in the faint but well-groomed constellation Coma Berenices. This sharp, colorful image reveals the spiral galaxy's boxy, bulging central core cut by obscuring dust lanes that lace NGC 4565's thin galactic plane. An assortment of other background galaxies is included in the pretty field of view. Thought similar in shape to our own Milky Way Galaxy, NGC 4565 lies about 40 million light-years distant and spans some 100,000 light-years.  Easily spotted with small telescopes, sky enthusiasts consider NGC 4565 to be a prominent celestial masterpiece Messier missed.","galaxy, edge, milky, thin, magnificent, spiral, viewed, edge-on, planet, earth, known, needle, narrow, profile, bright, stop, many, tour, northern, faint, well-groomed, constellation, coma, berenices, sharp, colorful, image, reveals, boxy, bulging, central, core, obscuring, dust, lane, lace, galactic, plane, assortment, background, included, pretty, field, view, thought, similar, shape, light-year, distant, span, spotted, small, telescope, enthusiast, consider, prominent, celestial, masterpiece, messier, missed"
Jets from the Necklace Nebula,"What celestial body wears the Necklace Nebula? First, analyses indicate that the Necklace is a planetary nebula, a gas cloud emitted by a star toward the end of its life. Also, what appears to be diamonds in the Necklace are actually bright knots of glowing gas.  In the center of the Necklace Nebula are likely two stars orbiting so close together that they share a common atmosphere and appear as one in the featured image by the Hubble Space Telescope.  The red-glowing gas clouds on the upper left and lower right are the results of jets from the center.  Exactly when and how the bright jets formed remains a topic of research.  The Necklace Nebula is only about 5,000 years old, spans about 5 light years, and can best be found with a large telescope toward the direction of the constellation of the Arrow (Sagitta).","necklace, nebula, celestial, body, wear, analysis, indicate, planetary, cloud, emitted, star, life, appears, diamond, bright, knot, glowing, center, likely, orbiting, share, common, appear, featured, image, hubble, space, telescope, red-glowing, upper, left, lower, right, result, formed, remains, topic, research, year, span, light, best, found, large, direction, constellation, arrow, sagitta"
The Jellyfish and Mars,"Normally faint and elusive, the Jellyfish Nebula is caught in this alluring scene. In the telescopic field of view two bright yellowish stars, Mu and Eta Geminorum, stand just below and above the Jellyfish Nebula at the left. Cool red giants, they lie at the foot of the celestial twin. The Jellyfish Nebula itself floats below and left of center, a bright arcing ridge of emission with dangling tentacles. In fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped supernova remnant IC 443, the expanding debris cloud from a massive star that exploded. Light from that explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years ago. Like its cousin in astrophysical waters the Crab Nebula supernova remnant, the Jellyfish Nebula is known to harbor a neutron star, the remnant of the collapsed stellar core. Composed on April 30, this telescopic snapshot also captures Mars. Now wandering through early evening skies, the Red Planet also shines with a yellowish glow on the right hand side of the field of view. Of course, the Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away, while Mars is currently almost 18 light-minutes from Earth.","jellyfish, faint, elusive, nebula, caught, alluring, scene, telescopic, field, view, bright, yellowish, star, geminorum, stand, left, cool, giant, foot, celestial, twin, float, center, arcing, ridge, emission, dangling, tentacle, fact, cosmic, part, bubble-shaped, supernova, remnant, expanding, debris, cloud, massive, exploded, light, explosion, reached, planet, earth, year, cousin, astrophysical, water, crab, known, harbor, neutron, collapsed, stellar, core, composed, snapshot, capture, wandering, early, evening, shine, glow, right, hand, side, course, light-year, light-minutes"
M13: The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules,"In 1716, English astronomer Edmond Halley noted, ""This is but a little Patch, but it shews itself to the naked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent."" Of course, M13 is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, one of the brightest globular star clusters in the northern sky. Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core.

Utopia on Mars,"sive Utopia Planitia on Mars is strewn with rocks and boulders in this 1976 image. Constructed from the Viking 2 lander's color and black and white image data, the scene approximates the appearance of the high northern martian plain to the human eye. For scale, the prominent rounded rock near center is about 20 centimeters (just under 8 inches) across.  Farther back on the right side of the frame the a dark angular boulder spans about 1.5 meters (5 feet). Also in view are two trenches dug by the lander's sampler arm, the ejected protective shroud that covered the soil collector head, and one of the lander's dust covered footpads at the lower right. On May 14, China’s Zhurong Mars rover successfully touchdown on Mars and has returned the first images of` its landing site in Utopia Planitia.","utopia, sive, planitia, strewn, rock, boulder, image, constructed, viking, lander, color, black, white, data, scene, approximates, high, northern, martian, plain, human, scale, prominent, rounded, center, centimeter, inch, right, side, frame, dark, angular, span, meter, foot, view, trench, sampler, ejected, protective, shroud, covered, soil, collector, head, dust, footpad, lower, china, zhurong, rover, touchdown, returned, first, landing, site"
Markarian's Chain,"Near the heart of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster the string of galaxies known as Markarian's Chain stretches across this deep telescopic field of view. Anchored in the frame at bottom center by prominent lenticular galaxies, M84 (bottom) and M86, you can follow the chain up and to the right. Near center you'll spot the pair of interacting galaxies NGC 4438 and NGC 4435, known to some as Markarian's Eyes. Its center an estimated 50 million light-years distant, the Virgo Cluster itself is the nearest galaxy cluster. With up to about 2,000 member galaxies, it has a noticeable gravitational influence on our own Local Group of Galaxies. Within the Virgo Cluster at least seven galaxies in Markarian's Chain  appear to move coherently, although others may appear to be part of the chain by chance.","markarian, chain, heart, virgo, galaxy, cluster, string, known, stretch, deep, telescopic, field, view, anchored, frame, bottom, center, prominent, lenticular, follow, spot, pair, interacting, estimated, light-year, distant, nearest, member, noticeable, gravitational, influence, local, group, least, appear, move, others, part, chance"
The Galaxy Tree,"First came the trees. In the town of Salamanca, Spain, the photographer noticed how distinctive a grove of oak trees looked after being pruned.  Next came the galaxy. The photographer stayed up until 2 am, waiting until the Milky Way Galaxy rose above the level of a majestic looking oak.  From this carefully chosen perspective, dust lanes in the galaxy appear to be natural continuations to branches of the tree.  Last came the light. A flashlight was used on the far side of the tree to project a silhouette. By coincidence, other trees also appeared as similar silhouettes across the relatively bright horizon. The featured image was captured as a single 30-second frame in 2015 and processed to digitally enhance the Milky Way.","galaxy, tree, came, town, salamanca, spain, noticed, distinctive, grove, looked, pruned, next, stayed, waiting, milky, rose, level, majestic, looking, chosen, perspective, dust, lane, appear, natural, continuation, branch, last, light, flashlight, used, side, project, silhouette, coincidence, appeared, similar, bright, horizon, featured, image, captured, single, frame, processed, enhance"
Lightning Eclipse from the Planet of the Goats,"Thunderstorms almost spoiled this view of the spectacular 2011 June 15 total lunar eclipse. Instead, storm clouds parted for 10 minutes during the total eclipse phase and lightning bolts contributed to the dramatic sky. Captured with a 30-second exposure the scene also inspired one of the more memorable titles (thanks to the astrophotographer) in APOD's now 25-year history.  Of course, the lightning reference clearly makes sense, and the shadow play of the dark lunar eclipse was widely viewed across planet Earth in Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia. The picture itself, however, was shot from the Greek island of Ikaria at Pezi. That area is known as ""the planet of the goats"" because of the rough terrain and strange looking rocks.  The next total lunar eclipse will occur on Wednesday.

The Moon During a Total Lunar Eclipse,"How does the Moon's appearance change during a total lunar eclipse? The featured time-lapse video was digitally processed to keep the Moon bright and centered during the 5-hour eclipse of 2018 January 31.  At first the full moon is visible because only a full moon can undergo a lunar eclipse.  Stars move by in the background because the Moon orbits the Earth during the eclipse. The circular shadow of the Earth is then seen moving across the Moon. The light blue hue of the shadow's edge is related to why Earth's sky is blue, while the deep red hue of the shadow's center is related to why the Sun appears red when near the horizon.  Tomorrow, people living from southeast Asia, across the Pacific, to the southwest Americas may get to see a Blood Supermoon Total Lunar Eclipse.  Here the term blood refers to the (likely) red color of the fully eclipsed Moon, while the term supermoon indicates the Moon's slightly high angular size -- due to being relatively close to the Earth in its slightly elliptical orbit.

The Outburst Clouds of Star AG Car,"What created these unusual clouds?  At the center of this 2021 Hubble image, processed by Judy Schmidt, sits AG Carinae, a supergiant star located about 20,000 light-years away in the southern constellation Carina.  The star's emitted power is over a million times that of the Sun, making AG Carinae one of the most luminous stars in our Milky Way galaxy.  AG Carinae and its neighbor Eta Carinae belong to the scarce Luminous Blue Variable (LBV) class of stars, known for their rare but violent eruptions.  The nebula that surrounds AG Car is interpreted as a remnant of one or more such outbursts.  This nebula measures 5 light-years across, is estimated to contain about 10 solar masses of gas, and to be at least 10,000 years old.  This Hubble image, taken to commemorate Hubble's 31st launch anniversary, is the first to capture the whole nebula, offering a new perspective on its structure and dust content.  The LBVs represent a late and short stage in the lives of some supergiant stars, but explaining their restlessness remains a challenge to humanity's understanding of how massive stars work.","cloud, star, created, unusual, center, hubble, image, processed, judy, schmidt, sits, carina, supergiant, located, light-year, southern, constellation, emitted, power, time, making, luminous, milky, galaxy, neighbor, belong, scarce, blue, variable, class, known, rare, violent, eruption, nebula, surround, interpreted, remnant, outburst, measure, estimated, contain, solar, mass, least, year, taken, commemorate, launch, anniversary, capture, whole, offering, perspective, structure, dust, content, lbvs, represent, short, stage, life, explaining, restlessness, remains, challenge, humanity, understanding, massive, work"
Mid-Eclipse and Milky Way,"May's perigee Full Moon slid through Earth's shadow yesterday entertaining night skygazers in regions around the Pacific. Seen from western North America, it sinks toward the rugged Sierra Nevada mountain range in this time-lapse series of the total lunar eclipse. Low on the western horizon the Moon was captured at mid-eclipse with two separate exposures. Combined they reveal the eclipsed Moon's reddened color against the dark night sky and the diffuse starlight band of the Milky Way.

Total Lunar Eclipse from Sydney,"The reddened shadow of planet Earth plays across the lunar disk in this telescopic image taken on May 26 near Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. On that crisp, clear autumn night a Perigee Full Moon slid through the northern edge of the shadow's dark central umbra. Short for a lunar eclipse, its total phase lasted only about 14 minutes. The Earth's shadow was not completely dark though. Instead it was suffused with a faint red light from all the planet's sunsets and sunrises seen from the perspective of an eclipsed Moon, the reddened sunlight scattered by Earth's atmosphere. The HDR composite of 6 exposures also shows the wide range of brightness variations within Earth's umbral shadow against a faint background of stars.","total, lunar, eclipse, sydney, reddened, shadow, planet, earth, play, disk, telescopic, image, taken, south, wale, australia, crisp, clear, autumn, night, full, moon, slid, northern, edge, dark, central, umbra, short, phase, lasted, minute, suffused, faint, light, sunset, sunrise, seen, perspective, eclipsed, scattered, atmosphere, composite, exposure, show, wide, range, brightness, variation, umbral, background, star"
Lunar Dust and Duct Tape,"Why is the Moon so dusty? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. On the Moon, the history of constant micrometeorite bombardment has blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.  For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. On the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover's fenders (video) in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear. This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered rover along with the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of ""duct tape"".","lunar, dust, duct, tape, moon, dusty, earth, rock, weathered, wind, water, creating, soil, sand, history, constant, micrometeorite, bombardment, blasted, rocky, surface, layer, powdery, regolith, apollo, astronaut, equipment, pervasive, fine, gritty, problem, december, harrison, schmitt, eugene, cernan, needed, repair, rover, fender, video, effort, keep, rooster, tail, gear, picture, reveals, wheel, covered, ingenious, application, spare, clamp, grey, strip"
Aurora over Clouds,"Auroras usually occur high above the clouds.  The auroral glow is created when fast-moving particles ejected from the Sun impact the Earth's magnetosphere, from which charged particles spiral along the Earth's magnetic field to strike atoms and molecules high in the Earth's atmosphere.  An oxygen atom, for example, will glow in the green light commonly emitted by an aurora after being energized by such a collision.  The lowest part of an aurora will typically occur about 100 kilometers up, while most clouds exist only below about 10 kilometers.  The relative heights of clouds and auroras are shown clearly in the featured picture in 2015 from Dyrholaey, Iceland. There, a determined astrophotographer withstood high winds and initially overcast skies in an attempt to capture aurora over a picturesque lighthouse, only to take, by chance, the featured picture including elongated lenticular clouds, along the way.

Mimas: Small Moon with a Big Crater,"Whatever hit Mimas nearly destroyed it.  What remains is one of the largest impact craters on one of Saturn's smallest round moons.  Analysis indicates that a slightly larger impact would have destroyed Mimas entirely.  The huge crater, named Herschel after the 1789 discoverer of Mimas, Sir William Herschel, spans about 130 kilometers and is featured here. Mimas' low mass produces a surface gravity just strong enough to create a spherical body but weak enough to allow such relatively large surface features. Mimas is made of mostly water ice with a smattering of rock - so it is accurately described as a big dirty snowball. The featured image was taken during the closest-ever flyby of the robot spacecraft Cassini past Mimas in 2010 while in orbit around Saturn.

Satellites over Orion,"What are those streaks across Orion? They are reflections of sunlight from numerous Earth-orbiting satellites. Appearing by eye as a series of successive points floating across a twilight sky, the increasing number of communications satellites, including SpaceX Starlink satellites, are causing concern among many astronomers. On the positive side, Starlink and similar constellations make the post-sunset sky more dynamic, satellite-based global communications faster, and help provide digital services to currently underserved rural areas.  On the negative side, though, these low Earth-orbit satellites make some deep astronomical imaging programs more difficult, in particular observing programs that need images taken just after sunset and just before dawn.  Planned future satellite arrays that function in higher orbits may impact investigations of the deep universe planned for large ground-based telescopes at any time during the night.  The streaks across Orion are not from Starlink but rather satellites in high geosynchronous orbit.  The featured picture, taken in 2019 December, is a digital combination of over 65 3-minutes exposures, with some images taken to highlight the background Orion Nebula, while others to feature the passing satellites.

"The Galactic Center in Stars, Gas, and Magnetism","What's going on near the center of our galaxy? To help find out, a newly detailed panorama has been composed that explores regions just above and below the galactic plane in radio and X-ray light.  X-ray light taken by the orbiting Chandra Observatory is shown in orange (hot), green (hotter), and purple (hottest) and superposed with a highly detailed image in radio waves, shown in gray, acquired by the MeerKAT array.  Interactions are numerous and complex. Galactic beasts such as expanding supernova remnants, hot winds from newly formed stars, unusually strong and colliding magnetic fields, and a central supermassive black hole are all battling in a space only 1000 light years across.  Thin bright stripes appear to result from twisting and newly connecting magnetic fields in colliding regions, creating an energetic type of inner galactic space weather with similarities to that created by our Sun.  Continued observations and study hold promise to not only shed more light on the history and evolution of our own galaxy -- but all galaxies.","galactic, center, star, magnetism, going, galaxy, help, find, detailed, panorama, composed, explores, region, plane, radio, x-ray, light, taken, orbiting, chandra, observatory, shown, orange, green, hotter, purple, hottest, superposed, image, wave, gray, acquired, meerkat, array, interaction, numerous, complex, beast, expanding, supernova, remnant, wind, formed, strong, colliding, magnetic, field, central, supermassive, black, hole, battling, space, year, thin, bright, stripe, appear, result, twisting, connecting, creating, energetic, type, inner, weather, similarity, created, continued, observation, study, hold, promise, shed, history, evolution"
Millions of Stars in Omega Centauri,"Globular star cluster Omega Centauri, also known as NGC 5139, is some 15,000 light-years away. The cluster is packed with about 10 million stars much older than the Sun within a volume about 150 light-years in diameter. It's the largest and brightest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. Omega Centauri's red giant stars (with a yellowish hue) are easy to pick out in this sharp, color telescopic view.","star, omega, centauri, globular, cluster, known, light-year, packed, much, older, volume, diameter, largest, brightest, roam, halo, milky, galaxy, consist, composition, enigmatic, exhibit, presence, different, stellar, population, spread, chemical, abundance, fact, remnant, core, small, merging, giant, yellowish, easy, pick, sharp, color, telescopic, view"
Blood Monster Moon,"On May 26, the Full Flower Moon was caught in this single exposure as it emerged from Earth's shadow and morning twilight began to wash over the western sky. Posing close to the horizon near the end of totality, an eclipsed lunar disk is framed against bare oak trees at Pinnacles National Park in central California. The Earth's shadow isn't completely dark though. Faintly suffused with sunlight scattered by the atmosphere, the inner shadow gives the totally eclipsed moon a reddened appearance and the very dramatic popular moniker of a Blood Moon. Still, the monstrous visage of a gnarled tree in silhouette made this view of a total lunar eclipse even scarier.","blood, monster, moon, full, flower, caught, single, exposure, emerged, earth, shadow, morning, twilight, began, wash, western, posing, close, horizon, totality, eclipsed, lunar, disk, framed, bare, tree, pinnacle, national, park, central, california, dark, suffused, sunlight, scattered, inner, give, reddened, dramatic, popular, moniker, monstrous, visage, gnarled, silhouette, made, view, total, eclipse, scarier"

Made up of 21 individual images the scene was recorded just after sunset on March 19, the 3,063rd martian day of Curiosity's on going exploration of the Red Planet. In the martian twilight high altitude clouds still shine above, reflecting the light from the Sun below the local horizon like the noctilucent clouds of planet Earth. Though water ice clouds drift through the thin martian atmosphere, these wispy clouds are also at extreme altitudes and could be composed of frozen carbon dioxide, crystals of dry ice.

Here, after initial cloudiness, the Sun appeared to rise in two pieces and during partial eclipse, causing the photographer to describe it as the most stunning sunrise of his life.  The dark circle near the top of the atmospherically-reddened Sun is the Moon -- but so is the dark peak just below it.  This is because along the way, the Earth's atmosphere had a layer of unusually warm air over the sea which acted like a gigantic lens and created a second image.  For a normal sunrise or sunset, this rare phenomenon of atmospheric optics is known as the Etruscan vase effect. The featured picture was captured in December 2019 from Al Wakrah, Qatar.  Some observers in a narrow band of Earth to the east were able to see a full annular solar eclipse -- where the Moon appears completely surrounded by the background Sun in a ring of fire.  The next solar eclipse, also an annular eclipse for well-placed observers, will occur later this week on  June 10.","distorted, sunrise, eclipse, seen, initial, cloudiness, appeared, rise, piece, partial, causing, describe, stunning, life, dark, circle, atmospherically-reddened, moon, peak, earth, atmosphere, layer, warm, acted, gigantic, lens, created, second, image, normal, sunset, rare, phenomenon, atmospheric, optic, known, etruscan, vase, effect, featured, picture, captured, december, wakrah, qatar, narrow, band, east, able, full, annular, solar, appears, surrounded, background, ring, fire, well-placed, observer, occur, week, june"
A Bright Nova in Cassiopeia,"What’s that new spot of light in Cassiopeia? A nova.  Although novas occur frequently throughout the universe, this nova, known as Nova Cas 2021 or V1405 Cas, became so unusually bright in the skies of Earth last month that it was visible to the unaided eye.  Nova Cas 2021 first brightened in mid-March but then, unexpectedly, became even brighter in mid-May and remained quite bright for about a week.  The nova then faded back to early-May levels,  but now is slightly brightening again and remains visible through binoculars.  Identified by the arrow, the nova occurred toward the constellation of Cassiopeia, not far from the Bubble Nebula.  A nova is typically caused by a thermonuclear explosion on the surface of a white dwarf star that is accreting matter from a binary-star companion -- although details of this outburst are currently unknown.  Novas don't destroy the underlying star, and are sometimes seen to recur.  The featured image was created from 14 hours of imaging from Detroit, Michigan, USA.  Both professional and amateur astronomers will likely continue to monitor Nova Cas 2021 and hypothesize about details of its cause.","bright, nova, cassiopeia, spot, light, occur, universe, known, v1405, became, earth, last, month, visible, unaided, first, brightened, mid-march, brighter, mid-may, remained, week, faded, early-may, level, brightening, remains, binoculars, identified, arrow, occurred, constellation, bubble, nebula, caused, thermonuclear, explosion, surface, white, dwarf, star, accreting, matter, binary-star, companion, detail, unknown, destroy, underlying, seen, recur, featured, image, created, hour, imaging, detroit, michigan, professional, amateur, astronomer, likely, continue, monitor, hypothesize, cause"
A Face in the Clouds of Jupiter from Juno,"What do you see in the clouds of Jupiter? On the largest scale, circling the planet, Jupiter has alternating light zones and reddish-brown belts. Rising zone gas, mostly hydrogen and helium, usually swirls around regions of high pressure. Conversely, falling belt gas usually whirls around regions of low pressure, like cyclones and hurricanes on Earth.  Belt storms can form into large and long-lasting white ovals and elongated red spots. NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft captured most of these cloud features in 2017 during perijove 6, its sixth pass over the giant planet in its looping 2-month orbit.  But it is surely not these clouds themselves that draws your attention to the displayed image, but rather their arrangement.  The face that stands out, nicknamed Jovey McJupiterFace, lasted perhaps a few weeks before the neighboring storm clouds rotated away. Juno has now completed 33 orbits around Jupiter and just yesterday made a close pass near Ganymede, our Solar System's largest moon.","face, cloud, jupiter, juno, largest, scale, circling, planet, alternating, light, reddish-brown, belt, rising, zone, hydrogen, helium, swirl, region, high, pressure, falling, whirl, cyclone, hurricane, earth, storm, form, large, long-lasting, white, oval, elongated, spot, nasa, robotic, spacecraft, captured, feature, sixth, giant, looping, 2-month, orbit, draw, attention, displayed, image, arrangement, stand, nicknamed, jovey, mcjupiterface, lasted, week, neighboring, rotated, completed, yesterday, made, close, ganymede, solar, system, moon"
A Total Lunar Eclipse Corona,"This moon appears multiply strange.  This moon was a full moon, specifically called a Flower Moon at this time of the year.  But that didn't make it strange -- full moons occur once a month (moon-th).  This moon was a supermoon, meaning that it reached its full phase near its closest approach to the Earth in its slightly elliptical orbit.  Somewhat strange, a supermoon appears a bit larger and brighter than the average full moon -- and enables it to be called a Super Flower Moon.  This moon was undergoing a total lunar eclipse. An eclipsed moon can look quite strange, being dark, unevenly lit, and, frequently, red -- sometimes called blood red. Therefore, this moon could be called a Super Flower Blood Moon. This moon was seen through thin clouds. These clouds created a faint corona around the moon, making it look not only strange, but colorful.  This moon was imaged so deeply that the heart of the Milky Way galaxy, far in the background, was visible to its lower right.  This moon, this shadow, this galaxy and these colors were all captured last month near Cassilis, NSW, Australia -- with a single shot. (Merged later with two lower shots that better capture the Milky Way.)

Circular Sun Halo,"Want to see a ring around the Sun? It's easy to do in daytime skies around the world. Created by randomly oriented ice crystals in thin high cirrus clouds, circular 22 degree halos are visible much more often than rainbows. This one was captured by smart phone photography on May 29 near Rome, Italy. Carefully blocking the Sun, for example with a finger tip, is usually all that it takes to reveal the common bright halo ring. The halo's characteristic angular radius is about equal to the span of your hand, thumb to little finger, at the end of your outstretched arm.  Want to see a ring of fire eclipse? That's harder. The spectacular annular phase of today's (June 10) solar eclipse, known as a ring of fire, was briefly visible only when standing along the Moon's narrow shadow track that passes over parts of northern Canada, Greenland, the Arctic, and eastern Russia. The solar eclipse was partial though, when seen from broader regions, including northern Asia, Europe, and parts of the US.","circular, halo, want, ring, easy, daytime, world, created, oriented, crystal, thin, high, cirrus, cloud, degree, visible, rainbow, captured, smart, phone, photography, rome, italy, blocking, example, finger, take, reveal, common, bright, characteristic, angular, radius, equal, span, hand, thumb, little, outstretched, fire, eclipse, harder, spectacular, annular, phase, today, june, solar, known, briefly, standing, moon, narrow, shadow, track, pass, part, canada, greenland, arctic, eastern, russia, partial, seen, broader, region, including, northern, europe"
Eclipse Flyby,"On June 10 a New Moon passed in front of the Sun. In silhouette only two days after reaching apogee, the most distant point in its elliptical orbit, the Moon's small apparent size helped create an annular solar eclipse. The brief but spectacular annular phase of the eclipse shows a bright solar disk as a ring of fire when viewed along its narrow, northerly shadow track across planet Earth. Cloudy early morning skies along the US east coast held gorgeous views of a partially eclipsed Sun though. Rising together Moon and Sun are captured in a sequence of consecutive frames near maximum eclipse in this digital composite, seen from Quincy Beach south of Boston, Massachusetts. The serendipitous sequence follows the undulating path of a bird in flight joining the Moon in silhouette with the rising Sun.

Eclipse on the Water,"clipses tend to come in pairs. Twice a year, during an eclipse season that lasts about 34 days, Sun, Moon, and Earth can nearly align. Then the full and new phases of the Moon separated by just over 14 days create a lunar and a solar eclipse. Often partial eclipses are part of any eclipse season. But sometimes the alignment at both new moon and full moon phases during a single eclipse season is close enough to produce a pair of both total (or a total and an annular) lunar and solar eclipses. For this eclipse season, the New Moon following the Full Moon's total lunar eclipse on May 26 did produce an annular solar eclipse along its northerly shadow track. That eclipse is seen here in a partially eclipsed sunrise on June 10, photographed from a fishing pier in Stratford, Connecticut in the northeastern US.

A Supercell Thunderstorm Over Texas,"Is that a cloud or an alien spaceship?  It's an unusual and sometimes dangerous type of thunderstorm cloud called a supercell. Supercells may spawn damaging tornados, hail, downbursts of air, or drenching rain.  Or they may just look impressive. A supercell harbors a mesocyclone -- a rising column of air surrounded by drafts of falling air.  Supercells could occur over many places on Earth but are particularly common in  Tornado Alley of the USA. Featured here are four time-lapse sequences of a supercell in 2013 rotating above and moving across Booker, Texas.  Captured in the video are new clouds forming near the storm center, dust swirling on the ground, lightning flashing in the upper clouds, all while the impressively sculptured complex rotates ominously.  Finally, after a few hours, as shown in the final sequence, dense rain falls as the storm begins to die out.

Ganymede from Juno,"What does the largest moon in the Solar System look like?  Jupiter's moon Ganymede, larger than even Mercury and Pluto, has an icy surface speckled with bright young craters overlying a mixture of older, darker, more cratered terrain laced with grooves and ridges.  The cause of the grooved terrain remains a topic of research, with a leading hypothesis relating it to shifting ice plates.  Ganymede is thought to have an ocean layer that contains more water than Earth -- and might contain life.  Like Earth's Moon, Ganymede keeps the same face towards its central planet, in this case Jupiter.  The featured image was captured last week by NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft as it passed only about 1000 kilometers above the immense moon.  The close pass reduced Juno's orbital period around Jupiter from 53 days to 43 days.  Juno continues to study the giant planet's high gravity, unusual magnetic field, and complex cloud structures.

Zhurong: New Rover on Mars,"There's a new rover on Mars. In mid-May, China's Tianwen-1 mission delivered the Zhurong rover onto the red planet.  As Mars means Planet of Fire in Chinese, the Zhurong rover's name means, roughly, God of Fire in Chinese mythology.  Zhurong landed in northern Utopia Planitia, the largest known impact basin in the Solar System, and an area reported to have much underground ice. Among many other scientific instruments, Zhurong carries ground-penetrating radar that can detect ice buried even 100-meters deep. Car-sized Zhurong is pictured here next to its landing base.  The image was snapped by a remote camera deployed by the rolling rover. Zhurong's planned 90-day mission includes studying the geology, soil, and atmosphere of Mars in Utopia Planitia.","rover, mid-may, china, tianwen-1, mission, delivered, planet, mean, fire, chinese, zhurong, name, mythology, landed, northern, utopia, planitia, largest, known, impact, basin, solar, system, area, reported, much, many, scientific, instrument, carry, ground-penetrating, radar, detect, buried, 100-meters, deep, car-sized, pictured, next, landing, base, image, snapped, remote, camera, deployed, rolling, planned, includes, studying, geology, soil"
Scorpius Enhanced,"If Scorpius looked this good to the unaided eye, humans might remember it better.  Scorpius more typically appears as a few bright stars in a well-known but rarely pointed out zodiacal constellation. To get a spectacular image like this, though, one needs a good camera, a dark sky, and some sophisticated image processing.  The resulting digitally-enhanced image shows many breathtaking features.  Diagonal across the image right is part of the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy.   Visible there are vast clouds of bright stars and long filaments of dark and intricate dust.  Rising vertically on the image left are dark dust bands known as the Dark River.  Several of the bright stars on the left are part of Scorpius' head and claws, and include the bright star Antares.  Numerous red emission nebulas, blue reflection nebulas, and dark filaments became visible as the deep 17-hour expo image developed. Scorpius appears prominently in southern skies after sunset during the middle of the year.","scorpius, enhanced, looked, good, unaided, human, remember, better, appears, bright, star, well-known, pointed, zodiacal, constellation, spectacular, image, need, camera, dark, sophisticated, processing, resulting, digitally-enhanced, show, many, breathtaking, feature, diagonal, right, part, plane, milky, galaxy, visible, vast, cloud, long, filament, intricate, dust, rising, left, band, known, river, several, head, claw, include, antares, numerous, emission, blue, reflection, nebula, became, deep, 17-hour, expo, developed, southern, sunset, year"
NGC 6888: The Crescent Nebula,"NGC 6888, also known as the Crescent Nebula, is a about 25 light-years across blown by winds from its central, bright, massive star. A triumvirate of astroimagers ( Joe, Glenn, Russell) created this sharp portrait of the cosmic bubble. Their telescopic collaboration collected over 30 hours of narrow band image data isolating light from hydrogen and oxygen atoms. The oxygen atoms produce the blue-green hue that seems to enshroud the detailed folds and filaments. Visible within the nebula, NGC 6888's central star is classified as a Wolf-Rayet star (WR 136). The star is shedding its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind, ejecting the equivalent of the Sun's mass every 10,000 years.  The nebula's complex structures are likely the result of this strong wind interacting with material ejected in an earlier phase. Burning fuel at a prodigious rate and near the end of its stellar life this star should ultimately go out with a bang in a spectacular supernova explosion. Found in the nebula rich constellation Cygnus, NGC 6888 is about 5,000 light-years away.","crescent, nebula, known, light-year, blown, wind, central, bright, massive, star, triumvirate, astroimagers, glenn, russell, created, sharp, portrait, cosmic, bubble, telescopic, collaboration, collected, hour, narrow, band, image, data, isolating, light, hydrogen, oxygen, atom, produce, blue-green, seems, enshroud, detailed, fold, filament, visible, classified, wolf-rayet, shedding, outer, envelope, strong, stellar, ejecting, equivalent, mass, year, complex, structure, likely, result, interacting, material, ejected, phase, burning, fuel, prodigious, rate, life, bang, spectacular, supernova, explosion, found, rich, constellation, cygnus"
Devil Horns from a Ring of Fire,"Atmospheric refraction flattened the solar disk and distorted its appearance in this telescopic view of an Atlantic sunrise on June 10. From Belmar, New Jersey on the US east coast, the scene was recorded at New Moon during this season's annular solar eclipse. The Moon in partial silhouette gives the rising Sun its crescent shape reminding some of the horns of the devil (or maybe a flying canoe ...). But at its full annular phase this eclipsed Sun looked like a ring of fire in the heavens. June's annular solar eclipse followed on the heels of the total lunar eclipse of late May's Full Moon. Of course, that total lunar eclipse was a dramatic red Blood Moon eclipse.","devil, horn, ring, fire, atmospheric, refraction, flattened, solar, disk, distorted, appearance, telescopic, view, atlantic, sunrise, june, belmar, jersey, east, coast, scene, recorded, moon, season, annular, eclipse, partial, silhouette, give, rising, crescent, shape, reminding, flying, canoe, full, phase, eclipsed, looked, heaven, followed, heel, total, lunar, late, course, dramatic, blood"
Northern Summer Twilight,"Nights grow shorter and days grow longer as the summer solstice approaches in the north. Usually seen at high latitudes in summer months, noctilucent or night shining clouds begin to make their appearance.  Drifting near the edge of space about 80 kilometers above the Earth's surface, these icy clouds were still reflecting the sunlight on June 14. Though the Sun was below the horizon as seen north of Forrest, Manitoba, Canada, they were caught in a single exposure of a near midnight twilight sky. Multiple exposures of the foreground track the lower altitude flash of fireflies, another fleeting apparition shining in the summer night.","northern, summer, twilight, night, grow, shorter, longer, solstice, approach, north, seen, high, latitude, month, noctilucent, shining, cloud, begin, make, appearance, drifting, edge, space, kilometer, earth, surface, reflecting, sunlight, june, horizon, forrest, manitoba, canada, caught, single, exposure, midnight, multiple, foreground, track, lower, altitude, flash, firefly, fleeting, apparition"
Sunrise Solstice over Stonehenge,"Today the Sun reaches its northernmost point in planet Earth's sky.  Called a solstice, many cultures mark this date as a change of seasons -- from spring to summer in Earth's Northern Hemisphere and from fall to winter in Earth's Southern Hemisphere.  Precisely, the single time of solstice occurs today for some parts of the world, but tomorrow for other regions. The featured image was taken during the week of the 2008 summer solstice at Stonehenge in United Kingdom, and captures a picturesque sunrise involving fog, trees, clouds, stones placed about 4,500 years ago, and a 4.5 billion year old large glowing orb. Even given the precession of the Earth's rotational axis over the millennia, the Sun continues to rise over Stonehenge in an astronomically significant way.","sunrise, solstice, stonehenge, today, reach, northernmost, point, planet, earth, called, many, culture, mark, date, change, season, spring, summer, northern, fall, winter, southern, hemisphere, single, time, occurs, part, world, tomorrow, region, featured, image, taken, week, united, kingdom, capture, picturesque, involving, tree, cloud, stone, placed, year, large, glowing, given, precession, rotational, axis, millennium, continues, rise, significant"
The Tadpole Galaxy from Hubble,"Why does this galaxy have such a long tail?  In this stunning vista, based on image data from the Hubble Legacy Archive, distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop for disrupted spiral galaxy Arp 188, the Tadpole Galaxy. The cosmic tadpole is a mere 420 million light-years distant toward the northern constellation of the Dragon (Draco). Its eye-catching tail is about 280 thousand light-years long and features massive, bright blue star clusters. One story goes that a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of Arp 188 - from right to left in this view - and was slung around behind the Tadpole by their gravitational attraction. During the close encounter, tidal forces drew out the spiral galaxy's stars, gas, and dust forming the spectacular tail. The intruder galaxy itself, estimated to lie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole, can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right. Following its terrestrial namesake, the Tadpole Galaxy will likely lose its tail as it grows older, the tail's star clusters forming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.

HD 163296: Jet from a Star in Formation,"How are jets created during star formation? No one is sure, although recent images of the young star system HD 163296 are quite illuminating. The central star in the featured image is still forming but seen already surrounded by a rotating disk and an outward moving jet. The disk is shown in radio waves taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) in Chile, and show gaps likely created by the gravity of very-young planets.  The jet, shown in visible light taken by the Very Large Telescope (VLT, also in Chile), expels fast-moving gas -- mostly hydrogen -- from the disk center.  The system spans hundreds of times the Earth-Sun distance (au).  Details of these new observations are being interpreted to  bolster conjectures that the jets are generated and shaped, at least in part, by magnetic fields in the rotating disk. Future observations of HD 163296 and other similar star-forming systems may help fill in details.

STARFORGE: A Star Formation Simulation,"How do stars form?  Most form in giant molecular clouds located in the central disk of a galaxy.  The process is started, influenced, and limited by the stellar winds, jets, high energy starlight, and supernova explosions of previously existing stars. The featured video shows these complex interactions as computed by the STARFORGE simulation of a gas cloud 20,000 times the mass of our Sun. In the time-lapse visualization, lighter regions indicate denser gas, color encodes the gas speed (purple is slow, orange is fast), while dots indicate the positions of newly formed stars. As the video begins, a gas cloud spanning about 50 light years begins to condense under its own gravity.  Within 2 million years, the first stars form, while newly formed massive stars are seen to expel impressive jets. The simulation is frozen after 4.3 million years, and the volume then rotated to gain a three-dimensional perspective. Much remains unknown about star formation, including the effect of the jets in limiting the masses of subsequently formed stars.

The sharp view is a combination of ultraviolet, visible, and infrared image data from the Hubble Space Telescope. About 50 million light-years distant toward the well-groomed constellation Coma Bernices, the face-on spiral is a member of the nearby Virgo Galaxy Cluster.

Andromeda in a Single Shot,"How far can you see? The Andromeda Galaxy, 2.5 million light years away, is the most distant object easily seen by the unaided eye. Other denizens of the night sky, like stars, clusters, and nebulae, are typically hundreds to thousands of light-years distant. That's far beyond the Solar System but well within our own Milky Way Galaxy. Also known as M31, the external galaxy poses directly above a chimney in this well-planned deep night skyscape from an old mine in southern Portugal. The image was captured in a single exposure tracking the sky, so the foreground is slightly blurred by the camera's motion while Andromeda itself looms large. The galaxy's brighter central region, normally all that's visible to the naked-eye, can be seen extending to spiral arms with fainter outer reaches spanning over 4 full moons across the sky. Of course in only 5 billion years or so, the stars of Andromeda could span the entire night sky as the Andromeda Galaxy merges with the Milky Way.","andromeda, single, shot, light, year, distant, object, seen, unaided, denizen, night, star, cluster, nebula, hundred, light-year, solar, system, milky, galaxy, known, external, pose, chimney, well-planned, deep, skyscape, mine, southern, portugal, image, captured, exposure, tracking, foreground, blurred, camera, motion, loom, large, brighter, central, region, visible, naked-eye, extending, spiral, fainter, outer, reach, spanning, full, moon, course, span, entire, merges"

The Dancing Auroras of Saturn,"What drives auroras on Saturn? To help find out, scientists have sorted through hundreds of infrared images of Saturn taken by the Cassini spacecraft for other purposes, trying to find enough aurora images to correlate changes and make movies. Once made, some movies clearly show that Saturnian auroras can change not only with the angle of the Sun, but also as the planet rotates. Furthermore, some auroral changes appear related to waves in Saturn's magnetosphere likely caused by Saturn's moons. Pictured here, a false-colored image taken in 2007 shows Saturn in three bands of infrared light.  The rings reflect relatively blue sunlight, while the planet itself glows in comparatively low energy red.  A band of southern aurora in visible in green. In has recently been found that auroras heat Saturn's upper atmosphere.

And it's not make believe.  The featured picture of an orange colored sky is real -- a digital composite of two exposures of the solar eclipse that occurred earlier this month.  The first exposure was taken with a regular telescope that captured an overexposed Sun and an underexposed Moon, while the second image was taken with a solar telescope that captured details of the chromosphere of the background Sun. The Sun's canvas-like texture was brought up by imaging in a very specific shade of red emitted by hydrogen.  Several prominences can be seen around the Sun's edge.  The image was captured just before sunset from Xilingol, Inner Mongolia, China. It's also not make-believe to imagine that the Moon is made of dense rock, the Sun is made of hot gas, and clouds are made of floating droplets of water and ice.","paper, moon, solar, eclipse, look, sailing, past, canvas, cardboard, cloud, make, believe, featured, picture, orange, colored, real, digital, composite, exposure, occurred, month, taken, regular, telescope, captured, overexposed, underexposed, second, image, detail, chromosphere, background, canvas-like, texture, brought, imaging, specific, shade, emitted, hydrogen, several, prominence, seen, edge, sunset, xilingol, inner, mongolia, china, make-believe, imagine, made, dense, rock, floating, droplet, water"
Orion Nebula: The Hubble View,"Few cosmic vistas excite the imagination like the Orion Nebula. Also known as M42, the nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot young stars at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud only 1,500 light-years away. The Orion Nebula offers one of the best opportunities to study how stars are born partly because it is the nearest large star-forming region, but also because the nebula's energetic stars have blown away obscuring gas and dust clouds that would otherwise block our view - providing an intimate look at a range of ongoing stages of starbirth and evolution. The featured image of the Orion Nebula is among the sharpest ever, constructed using data from the Hubble Space Telescope.  The entire Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.","orion, hubble, view, cosmic, vista, excite, imagination, nebula, known, glowing, surround, young, star, edge, immense, interstellar, molecular, cloud, light-year, offer, best, opportunity, study, born, nearest, large, star-forming, region, energetic, blown, obscuring, dust, otherwise, block, providing, intimate, look, range, ongoing, stage, starbirth, evolution, featured, image, sharpest, constructed, using, data, space, telescope, entire, span, light, year, located, spiral, galaxy"
Simulation: Formation of the First Stars,"How did the first stars form? To help find out, the SPHINX computer simulation of star formation in the very early universe was created, some results of which are shown in the featured video. Time since the Big Bang is shown in millions of years on the upper left.  Even 100 million years after the Big Bang, matter was spread too uniformly across the cosmos for stars to be born.  Besides background radiation, the universe was dark. Soon, slight matter clumps rich in hydrogen gas begin to coalesce into the first stars. In the time-lapse video, purple denotes gas, white denotes light, and gold shows radiation so energetic that it ionizes hydrogen, breaking it up into charged electrons and protons.  The gold-colored regions also track the most massive stars that die with powerful supernovas. The inset circle highlights a central region that is becoming a galaxy.  The simulation continues until the universe was about 550 million years old.  To assess the accuracy of the SPHINX simulations and the assumptions that went into them, the results are not only being compared to current deep observations, but will also be compared with more direct observations of the early universe planned with NASA's pending James Webb Space Telescope.","simulation, formation, star, first, form, help, find, sphinx, computer, early, universe, created, result, shown, featured, video, time, bang, year, upper, left, matter, spread, cosmos, born, background, radiation, dark, slight, clump, rich, hydrogen, begin, coalesce, time-lapse, purple, denotes, white, light, gold, show, energetic, ionizes, breaking, charged, electron, proton, gold-colored, region, massive, powerful, supernova, inset, circle, highlight, central, becoming, galaxy, continues, assess, accuracy, assumption, went, compared, current, deep, observation, direct, planned, nasa, pending, james, webb, space, telescope"
Perseverance Selfie with Ingenuity,"On sol 46 (April 6, 2021) the Perseverance rover held out a robotic arm to take its first selfie on Mars. The WATSON camera at the end of the arm was designed to take close-ups of martian rocks and surface details though, and not a quick snap shot of friends and smiling faces. In the end, teamwork and weeks of planning on Mars time was required to program a complex series of exposures and camera motions to include Perseverance and its surroundings. The resulting 62 frames were composed into a detailed mosiac, one of the most complicated Mars rover selfies ever taken. In this version of the selfie, the rover's Mastcam-Z and SuperCam instruments are looking toward WATSON and the end of the rover's outstretched arm. About 4 meters (13 feet) from Perseverance is a robotic companion, the Mars Ingenuity helicopter.","perseverance, selfie, ingenuity, rover, held, robotic, take, first, watson, camera, designed, close-ups, martian, rock, surface, detail, quick, snap, shot, friend, smiling, face, teamwork, week, planning, time, required, program, complex, series, exposure, motion, include, surroundings, resulting, frame, composed, detailed, mosiac, complicated, selfies, taken, version, mastcam-z, supercam, instrument, looking, outstretched, meter, foot, companion, helicopter"
AR2835: Islands in the Photosphere,"Awash in a sea of incandescent plasma and anchored in strong magnetic fields, sunspots are planet-sized dark islands in the solar photosphere, the bright surface of the Sun. Found in solar active regions, sunspots look dark only because they are slightly cooler though, with temperatures of about 4,000 kelvins compared to 6,000 kelvins for the surrounding solar surface. These sunspots lie in active region AR2835. The largest active region now crossing the Sun, AR2835 is captured in this sharp telescopic close-up from July 1 in a field of view that spans about 150,000 kilometers or over ten Earth diameters. With powerful magnetic fields, solar active regions are often responsible for solar flares and coronal mass ejections, storms which affect space weather near planet Earth.","ar2835, island, awash, incandescent, plasma, anchored, strong, magnetic, field, sunspot, planet-sized, dark, solar, bright, surface, found, active, region, look, cooler, temperature, kelvin, compared, surrounding, largest, crossing, captured, sharp, telescopic, close-up, july, view, span, kilometer, earth, powerful, responsible, flare, coronal, mass, ejection, storm, affect, space, weather, planet"
Along the Milky Way,"You can't walk along the Milky Way. Still, under a dark sky you can explore it. To the eye the pale luminous trail of light arcing through the sky on a dark, moonless night does appear to be a path through the heavens. The glowing celestial band is the faint, collective light of distant stars cut by swaths of obscuring interstellar dust clouds. It lies along the plane of our home galaxy, so named because it looks like a milky way. Since Galileo's time, the Milky Way has been revealed to telescopic skygazers to be filled with congeries of innumerable stars and cosmic wonders.","milky, walk, dark, explore, pale, luminous, trail, light, arcing, moonless, night, appear, path, heaven, glowing, celestial, band, faint, collective, distant, star, swath, obscuring, interstellar, dust, cloud, plane, home, galaxy, named, look, galileo, time, revealed, telescopic, skygazers, filled, congeries, innumerable, cosmic, wonder"
The Face on Mars,"Wouldn't it be fun if clouds were castles?  Wouldn't it be fun if the laundry on the bedroom chair was a superhero?  Wouldn't it be fun if rock mesas on Mars were interplanetary monuments to the human face?  Clouds, though, are floating droplets of water and ice.  Laundry is cotton, wool, or plastic, woven into garments.  Famous Martian rock mesas known by names like the Face on Mars appear quite natural when seen more clearly on better images.  Is reality boring? Nobody knows why some clouds make rain.  Nobody knows if life ever developed on Mars.  Nobody knows why the laundry on the bedroom chair smells like root beer.  Scientific exploration can not only resolve mysteries, but uncover new knowledge, greater mysteries, and yet deeper questions.  As humanity explores our universe, perhaps fun -- through discovery --  is just beginning.","face, cloud, castle, laundry, bedroom, chair, superhero, rock, mesa, interplanetary, monument, human, floating, droplet, water, cotton, wool, plastic, woven, garment, famous, martian, known, name, appear, natural, seen, image, reality, boring, nobody, know, make, rain, life, developed, smell, root, beer, scientific, exploration, resolve, mystery, knowledge, greater, deeper, question, humanity, explores, universe, discovery, beginning"
IC 4592: The Blue Horsehead Reflection Nebula,"Do you see the horse's head?   What you are seeing is not the famous Horsehead nebula toward Orion but rather a fainter nebula that only takes on a familiar form with deeper imaging.  The main part of the here imaged molecular cloud complex is a reflection nebula cataloged as IC 4592.  Reflection nebulas are actually made up of very fine dust that normally appears dark but can look quite blue when reflecting the visible light of energetic nearby stars.  In this case, the source of much of the reflected light is a star at the eye of the horse.  That star is part of Nu Scorpii, one of the brighter star systems toward the constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius).   A second reflection nebula dubbed IC 4601 is visible surrounding two stars to the right of the image center.

Saturn and Six Moons,"How many moons does Saturn have? So far 82 have been confirmed, the smallest being only a fraction of a kilometer across. Six of its largest satellites can be seen here in a composite image with 13 short exposure of the bright planet, and 13 long exposures of the brightest of its faint moons, taken over two weeks last month.  Larger than Earth's Moon and even slightly larger than Mercury,Saturn's largest moon Titan has a diameter of 5,150 kilometers and was captured making nearly a complete orbit around its ringed parent planet.  Saturn's first known natural satellite, Titan was discovered in 1655 by Dutch astronomer Christiaan Huygens, in contrast with several newly discovered moons announced in 2019.  The trail on the far right belongs to Iapetus, Saturn's third largest moon. The radius of painted Iapetus' orbit is so large that only a portion of it was captured here.

Flight Through the Orion Nebula in Infrared Light,"What would it look like to fly into the Orion Nebula?  The exciting dynamic visualization of the Orion Nebula is based on real astronomical data and adept movie rendering techniques. Up close and personal with a famous stellar nursery normally seen from 1,500 light-years away, the digitally modeled representation based is based on infrared data from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The perspective moves along a valley over a light-year wide, in the wall of the region's giant molecular cloud. Orion's valley ends in a cavity carved by the energetic winds and radiation of the massive central stars of the Trapezium star cluster. The entire Orion Nebula spans about 40 light years and is located in the same spiral arm of our Galaxy as the Sun.","flight, orion, nebula, infrared, light, look, exciting, dynamic, visualization, based, real, astronomical, data, movie, rendering, technique, close, personal, famous, stellar, nursery, seen, light-year, modeled, representation, spitzer, space, telescope, perspective, move, valley, wide, wall, region, giant, molecular, cloud, cavity, carved, energetic, wind, radiation, massive, central, star, trapezium, cluster, entire, span, year, located, spiral, galaxy"
Perihelion to Aphelion,"Aphelion for 2021 occurred on July 5th. That's the point in Earth's elliptical orbit when it is farthest from the Sun. Of course, the distance from the Sun doesn't determine the seasons. Those are governed by the tilt of Earth's axis of rotation, so July is still summer in the north and winter in the southern hemisphere. But it does mean that on July 5 the Sun was at its smallest apparent size when viewed from planet Earth. This composite neatly compares two pictures of the Sun, both taken with the same telescope and camera. The left half was captured close to the date of the 2021 perihelion (January 2), the closest point in Earth's orbit. The right was recorded just before the aphelion in 2021. Otherwise difficult to notice, the change in the Sun's apparent diameter between perihelion and aphelion amounts to a little over 3 percent.","perihelion, aphelion, occurred, july, point, earth, elliptical, orbit, farthest, course, distance, determine, season, governed, tilt, axis, rotation, summer, north, winter, southern, mean, smallest, apparent, size, viewed, planet, composite, compare, picture, taken, telescope, camera, left, half, captured, date, january, closest, recorded, difficult, notice, change, diameter, amount, little, percent"
M82: Starburst Galaxy with a Superwind,"M82 is a starburst galaxy with a superwind. In fact, through ensuing supernova explosions and powerful winds from massive stars, the burst of star formation in M82 is driving a prodigious outflow. Evidence for the superwind from the galaxy's central regions is clear in sharp telescopic snapshot. The composite image highlights emission from long outflow filaments of atomic hydrogen gas in reddish hues. Some of the gas in the superwind, enriched in heavy elements forged in the massive stars, will eventually escape into intergalactic space. Triggered by a close encounter with nearby large galaxy M81, the furious burst of star formation in M82 should last about 100 million years or so. Also known as the Cigar Galaxy for its elongated visual appearance, M82 is about 30,000 light-years across. It lies 12 million light-years away near the northern boundary of Ursa Major.","starburst, galaxy, superwind, fact, ensuing, supernova, explosion, powerful, massive, star, burst, formation, driving, prodigious, outflow, evidence, central, region, clear, sharp, telescopic, snapshot, composite, image, highlight, emission, filament, atomic, hydrogen, reddish, enriched, heavy, element, forged, escape, intergalactic, space, triggered, close, encounter, large, furious, last, year, known, cigar, elongated, visual, appearance, light-year, northern, boundary, ursa, major"
Mercury and the Da Vinci Glow,"On July 8th early morning risers saw Mercury near an old Moon low on the eastern horizon. On that date bright planet, faint glow of lunar night side, and sunlit crescent were captured in this predawn skyscape from Tenerife's Teide National Park in the Canary Islands.  Never far from the Sun in planet Earth's sky, the fleeting inner planet shines near its brightest in the morning twilight scene. Mercury lies just below the zeta star of the constellation Taurus, Zeta Tauri, near the tip of the celestial bull's horn. Of course the Moon's ashen glow is earthshine, earthlight reflected from the Moon's night side. A description of earthshine, in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface, was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. Waiting for the coming dawn in the foreground are the Teide Observatory's sentinels of the Sun, also known as (large domes left to right) the THEMIS, VTT, and GREGOR solar telescopes.","mercury, vinci, glow, early, morning, riser, moon, eastern, horizon, date, bright, planet, faint, lunar, night, side, sunlit, crescent, captured, predawn, skyscape, tenerife, teide, national, park, canary, island, earth, fleeting, inner, shine, brightest, twilight, scene, zeta, star, constellation, taurus, tauri, celestial, bull, horn, course, ashen, earthshine, earthlight, reflected, description, term, sunlight, ocean, illuminating, dark, surface, written, year, leonardo, waiting, coming, dawn, foreground, observatory, sentinel, known, large, dome, left, right, themis, gregor, solar, telescope"
Find the Moon,"Where's the Moon? Somewhere in this image, the Earth's Moon is hiding.  The entire Moon is visible, in its completely full phase, in plain sight. Even the photographer's keen eye couldn't find it even though he knew exactly where to look -- only the long exposure of his camera picked it up -- barely.  Although by now you might be congratulating yourself on finding it, why was it so difficult to see? For one reason, this photograph was taken during a total lunar eclipse, when the Earth's shadow made the Moon much dimmer than a normal full Moon. For another, the image, taken in Colorado, USA, was captured just before sunrise. With the Moon on the exact opposite side of the sky from the Sun, this meant that the Sun was just below the horizon, but still slightly illuminating the sky. Last, as the Moon was only about two degrees above the horizon, the large volume of air between the camera and the horizon scattered a lot of light away from the background Moon. Twelve minutes after this image was acquired in 2012, the Sun peeked over the horizon and the Moon set.","find, moon, image, earth, hiding, entire, visible, full, phase, plain, sight, keen, knew, look, long, exposure, camera, picked, congratulating, finding, difficult, reason, photograph, taken, total, lunar, eclipse, shadow, made, much, dimmer, normal, colorado, captured, sunrise, exact, opposite, side, meant, horizon, illuminating, last, degree, large, volume, scattered, light, twelve, minute, acquired, peeked"
M27: The Dumbbell Nebula,"What will become of our Sun? The first hint of our Sun's future was discovered inadvertently in 1764. At that time, Charles Messier was compiling a list of diffuse objects not to be confused with comets. The 27th object on Messier's list, now known as M27 or the Dumbbell Nebula, is a planetary nebula, one of the brightest planetary nebulae on the sky -- and visible toward the constellation of the Fox (Vulpecula) with binoculars. It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27, featured here in colors emitted by hydrogen and oxygen. We now know that in about 6 billion years, our Sun will shed its outer gases into a planetary nebula like M27, while its remaining center will become an X-ray hot white dwarf star.  Understanding the physics and significance of M27 was well beyond 18th century science, though. Even today, many things remain mysterious about planetary nebulas, including how their intricate shapes are created.","dumbbell, become, first, hint, future, discovered, time, charles, compiling, list, diffuse, object, confused, messier, known, planetary, nebula, brightest, visible, constellation, vulpecula, binoculars, take, light, year, reach, featured, color, emitted, hydrogen, oxygen, know, shed, outer, remaining, center, x-ray, white, dwarf, star, understanding, physic, significance, 18th, century, science, today, many, thing, remain, mysterious, including, intricate, shape, created"
Saturn's Iapetus: Painted Moon in 3D,"What has happened to Saturn's moon Iapetus?  Vast sections of this strange world are dark brown,  while others are as bright white.  The composition of the dark material is unknown, but infrared spectra indicate that it possibly contains some dark form of carbon. Iapetus also has an unusual equatorial ridge that makes it appear like a walnut.  To help better understand this seemingly painted moon, NASA directed the robotic Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn to swoop within 2,000 kilometers in 2007. Iapetus is pictured here in 3D.  A huge impact crater seen in the south spans a tremendous 450 kilometers and appears superposed on an older crater of similar size. The dark material is seen increasingly coating the easternmost part of Iapetus, darkening craters and highlands alike.  Close inspection indicates that the dark coating typically faces the moon's equator and is less than a meter thick. A leading hypothesis is that the dark material is mostly dirt leftover when relatively warm but dirty ice sublimates. An initial coating of dark material may have been effectively painted on by the accretion of meteor-liberated debris from other moons.","saturn, iapetus, painted, happened, moon, vast, section, strange, world, dark, brown, others, bright, white, composition, material, unknown, infrared, spectrum, indicate, contains, form, carbon, unusual, equatorial, ridge, make, appear, walnut, help, better, understand, directed, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, orbiting, swoop, kilometer, pictured, huge, impact, crater, seen, span, tremendous, appears, superposed, older, similar, size, coating, easternmost, part, darkening, highland, close, inspection, indicates, face, equator, meter, thick, leading, hypothesis, dirt, leftover, warm, dirty, sublimate, initial, accretion, meteor-liberated, debris"
GW200115: Simulation of a Black Hole Merging with a Neutron Star,"What happens when a black hole destroys a neutron star? Analyses indicate that just such an event created gravitational wave event GW200115, detected in 2020 January by LIGO and Virgo observatories. To better understand the unusual event, the featured visualization was created from a computer simulation. The visualization video starts with the black hole (about 6 times the Sun's mass) and neutron star (about 1.5 times the Sun's mass) circling each other, together emitting an increasing amount of gravitational radiation. The picturesque pattern of gravitational wave emission is shown in blue. The duo spiral together increasingly fast until the neutron star becomes completely absorbed by the black hole.  Since the neutron star did not break apart during the collision, little light escaped -- which matches the lack of an observed optical counterpart. The remaining black hole rings briefly, and as that dies down so do the emitted gravitational waves.  The 30-second time-lapse video may seem short, but it actually lasts about 1000 times longer than the real merger event.

The Dark Tower in Scorpius,"In silhouette against a crowded star field along the tail of the arachnalogical constellation Scorpius, this dusty cosmic cloud evokes for some the image of an ominous dark tower. In fact, clumps of dust and molecular gas collapsing to form stars may well lurk within the dark nebula, a structure that spans almost 40 light-years across this gorgeous telescopic portrait. Known as a cometary globule, the swept-back cloud, is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the OB association of very hot stars in NGC 6231, off the upper edge of the scene. That energetic ultraviolet light also powers the globule's bordering reddish glow of hydrogen gas. Hot stars embedded in the dust can be seen as bluish reflection nebulae. This dark tower, NGC 6231, and associated nebulae are about 5,000 light-years away.","dark, tower, scorpius, silhouette, crowded, star, field, tail, arachnalogical, constellation, dusty, cosmic, cloud, evokes, image, ominous, fact, clump, dust, molecular, collapsing, form, lurk, nebula, structure, span, light-year, gorgeous, telescopic, portrait, known, cometary, globule, swept-back, shaped, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, association, upper, edge, scene, energetic, light, power, bordering, reddish, glow, hydrogen, embedded, seen, bluish, reflection, associated"
Love and War by Moonlight,"Venus, named for the Roman goddess of love, and Mars, the war god's namesake, come together by moonlight in this serene skyview, recorded on July 11 from Lualaba province, Democratic Republic of Congo, planet Earth. Taken in the western twilight sky shortly after sunset the exposure also records earthshine illuminating the otherwise dark surface of the young crescent Moon. Of course the Moon has moved on. Venus still shines in the west though as the evening star, third brightest object in Earth's sky, after the Sun and the Moon itself. Seen here above a brilliant Venus, Mars moved even closer to the brighter planet and by July 13 could be seen only about a Moon's width away. Mars has since slowly wandered away from much brighter Venus in the twilight, but both are sliding toward bright star Regulus. Alpha star of the constellation Leo, Regulus lies off the top of this frame and anticipates a visit from Venus and then Mars in twilight skies of the coming days.","love, moonlight, venus, named, roman, goddess, namesake, come, serene, skyview, recorded, lualaba, province, democratic, republic, congo, planet, earth, taken, western, twilight, sunset, exposure, record, earthshine, illuminating, dark, surface, young, crescent, moon, course, moved, shine, west, evening, star, third, brightest, object, seen, brilliant, brighter, july, width, wandered, much, sliding, bright, regulus, alpha, constellation, frame, anticipates, coming"
Alphonsus and Arzachel,"Point your telescope at tonight's first quarter Moon. Along the terminator, the shadow line between night and day, you might find these two large craters staring back at you with an owlish gaze. Alphonsus (left) and Arzachel are ancient impact craters on the north eastern shores of Mare Nubium, the lunar Sea of Clouds. The larger Alphonsus is over 100 kilometers in diameter. A low sun angle highlights the crater's sharp 1.5 kilometer high central peak in bright sunlight and dark shadow. Scouting for potential Apollo moon landing sites, the Ranger 9 spacecraft returned closeup pictures of Alphonsus before crashing in the crater just northeast (toward the upper left) of its central mountain in 1965.

The Andromeda Galaxy in Ultraviolet,"What does the Andromeda galaxy look like in ultraviolet light? Young blue stars circling the galactic center dominate.  A mere 2.5 million light-years away, the Andromeda Galaxy, also known as M31, really is just next door as large galaxies go. Spanning about 230,000 light-years, it took 11 different image fields from NASA's Galaxy Evolution Explorer (GALEX) satellite telescope to produce this gorgeous portrait of the spiral galaxy in ultraviolet light in 2003. While its spiral arms stand out in visible light images, Andromeda's arms look more like rings in ultraviolet. The rings are sites of intense star formation and have been interpreted as evidence that Andromeda collided with its smaller neighboring elliptical galaxy M32 more than 200 million years ago. The Andromeda galaxy and our own comparable Milky Way galaxy are the most massive members of the Local Group of galaxies and are projected to collide in several billion years -- perhaps around the time that our Sun's atmosphere will expand to engulf the Earth.","andromeda, galaxy, ultraviolet, look, light, young, blue, star, circling, galactic, center, dominate, light-year, known, next, door, large, spanning, took, different, image, field, nasa, evolution, explorer, galex, satellite, telescope, produce, gorgeous, portrait, spiral, stand, visible, ring, site, intense, formation, interpreted, evidence, collided, smaller, neighboring, elliptical, year, comparable, milky, massive, member, local, group, projected, collide, several, time, atmosphere, expand, engulf, earth"
Framed by Trees: A Window to the Galaxy,"The photographer had this shot in mind for some time. He knew that objects overhead are the brightest -- since their light is scattered the least by atmospheric air. He also that knew the core of our Milky Way Galaxy was just about straight up near midnight around this time of year in South Australia.  Chasing his mental picture, he ventured deep inside the Kuipto Forest where tall radiata pines blocked out much of the sky -- but not in this clearing.  There, through a window framed by trees, he captured his envisioned combination of local and distant nature. Sixteen exposures of both trees and the Milky Way Galaxy were recorded. Antares is the bright orange star to left of our Galaxy's central plane, while Alpha Centauri is the bright star just to the right of the image center.  The direction toward our Galaxy's center is below Antares.  Although in a few hours the Earth's rotation moved the Galactic plane up and to the left -- soon invisible behind the timber, his mental image was secured forever -- and is featured here.

Thor's Helmet,"Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor's Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown with a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This remarkably sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from broadband and narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula's filamentary structures.

Colors: Ring Nebula versus Stars,"What if you could see, separately, all the colors of the Ring? And of the surrounding stars? There's technology for that. The featured image shows the Ring Nebula (M57) and nearby stars through such technology: in this case, a prism-like diffraction grating.  The Ring Nebula is seen only a few times because it emits light, primarily, in only a few colors. The two brightest emitted colors are hydrogen (red) and oxygen (blue), appearing as nearly overlapping images to the left of the image center.  The image just to the right of center is the color-combined icon normally seen.  Stars, on the other hand, emit most of their light in colors all across the visible spectrum.  These colors, combined, make a nearly continuous streak -- which is why stars appear accompanied by multicolored bars.

NGC 7814: Little Sombrero with Supernova,"Point your telescope toward the high flying constellation Pegasus and you can find this expanse of Milky Way stars and distant galaxies. NGC 7814 is centered in the pretty field of view that would almost be covered by a full moon. NGC 7814 is sometimes called the Little Sombrero for its resemblance to the brighter more famous M104, the Sombrero Galaxy. Both Sombrero and Little Sombrero are spiral galaxies seen edge-on, and both have extensive halos and central bulges cut by a thin disk with thinner dust lanes in silhouette. In fact, NGC 7814 is some 40 million light-years away and an estimated 60,000 light-years across. That actually makes the Little Sombrero about the same physical size as its better known namesake, appearing smaller and fainter only because it is farther away. In this telescopic view from July 17, NGC 7814 is hosting a newly discovered supernova, dominant immediately to the left of the galaxy's core. Cataloged as SN 2021rhu, the stellar explosion has been identified as a Type Ia supernova, useful toward calibrating the distance scale of the universe.","little, sombrero, supernova, point, telescope, high, flying, constellation, pegasus, find, expanse, milky, star, distant, galaxy, centered, pretty, field, view, covered, full, moon, called, resemblance, brighter, famous, m104, spiral, seen, edge-on, extensive, halo, central, bulge, thin, disk, thinner, dust, lane, silhouette, fact, light-year, estimated, make, physical, size, known, namesake, appearing, smaller, fainter, telescopic, july, hosting, discovered, dominant, left, core, cataloged, stellar, explosion, identified, type, useful, calibrating, distance, scale, universe"
"Elephant, Bat, and Squid","Sprawling emission nebulae IC 1396 and Sh2-129 mix glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds in this 10 degree wide field of view toward the northern constellation Cepheus the King. Energized by its bluish central star IC 1396 (left) is hundreds of light-years across and some 3,000 light-years distant. The nebula's intriguing dark shapes include a winding dark cloud popularly known as the Elephant's Trunk below and right of center. Tens of light-years long, it holds the raw raw material for star formation and is known to hide protostars within. Located a similar distance from planet Earth, the bright knots and swept back ridges of emission of Sh2-129 on the right suggest its popular name, the Flying Bat Nebula. Within the Flying Bat, the most recently recognized addition to this royal cosmic zoo is the faint bluish emission from Ou4, the Giant Squid nebula.","elephant, squid, sprawling, emission, sh2-129, glowing, interstellar, dark, dust, cloud, degree, wide, field, view, northern, constellation, cepheus, king, energized, bluish, central, star, left, hundred, light-year, distant, nebula, intriguing, shape, include, winding, known, trunk, center, hold, material, formation, hide, protostars, located, similar, distance, planet, earth, bright, knot, swept, ridge, right, suggest, popular, name, flying, recognized, addition, royal, cosmic, faint, giant"
The Edge of Space,"Where does space begin? For purposes of spaceflight some would say at the Karman line, currently defined as an altitude of 100 kilometers (60 miles). Others might place a line 80 kilometers (50 miles) above Earth's mean sea level. But there is no sharp physical boundary that marks the end of atmosphere and the beginning of space. In fact, the Karman line itself is near the transition between the upper mesosphere and lower thermosphere. Night shining or noctilucent clouds are high-latitude summer apparitions formed at altitudes near the top of the mesosphere, up to 80 kilometers or so, also known as polar mesospheric clouds. Auroral bands of the northern (and southern) lights caused by energetic particles exciting atoms in the thermosphere can extend above 80 kilometers to over 600 kilometers altitude. Taken from a cockpit while flying at an altitude of 10 kilometers (33,000 feet) in the realm of stratospheric aeronautics, this snapshot captures both noctilucent clouds and aurora borealis under a starry sky, looking toward planet Earth's horizon and the edge of space.","edge, space, begin, purpose, spaceflight, karman, line, defined, altitude, kilometer, mile, others, place, earth, mean, level, sharp, physical, boundary, mark, beginning, fact, transition, lower, night, shining, noctilucent, cloud, high-latitude, summer, apparition, formed, known, polar, mesospheric, auroral, band, northern, southern, light, caused, energetic, particle, exciting, atom, extend, taken, cockpit, flying, foot, realm, stratospheric, aeronautics, snapshot, capture, aurora, borealis, starry, looking, planet, horizon"
Crescent Neptune and Triton,"Gliding silently through the outer Solar System, the Voyager 2 spacecraft camera captured Neptune and Triton together in crescent phase.  The elegant picture of the ice-giant planet and its cloudy moon was taken from behind just after closest approach in 1989.  It could not have been taken from Earth because Neptune never shows a crescent phase to sunward Earth. The unusual vantage point also robs Neptune of its familiar blue hue, as sunlight seen from here is scattered forward, and so is reddened like the setting Sun.  Neptune is smaller but more massive than Uranus, has several dark rings, and emits more light than it receives from the Sun.","crescent, triton, gliding, solar, system, voyager, spacecraft, camera, captured, neptune, phase, elegant, picture, ice-giant, planet, cloudy, moon, taken, closest, approach, show, sunward, earth, unusual, vantage, point, robs, familiar, blue, sunlight, seen, scattered, reddened, setting, smaller, massive, uranus, several, dark, ring, emits, light, receives"
CG4: A Ruptured Cometary Globule,"Can a gas cloud grab a galaxy?  It's not even close.  The ""claw"" of this odd looking ""creature"" in the featured photo is a gas cloud known as a cometary globule.  This globule, however, has ruptured.  Cometary globules are typically characterized by dusty heads and elongated tails.  These features cause cometary globules to have visual similarities to comets, but in reality they are very much different.  Globules are frequently the birthplaces of stars, and many show very young stars in their heads. The reason for the rupture in the head of this object is not yet known. The galaxy to the left of the globule is huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near CG4 by chance superposition.","ruptured, cometary, globule, cloud, grab, galaxy, close, claw, looking, creature, featured, photo, known, characterized, dusty, head, elongated, tail, feature, cause, visual, similarity, comet, reality, different, birthplace, many, show, young, star, reason, rupture, object, left, huge, distance, placed, chance, superposition"
Fleming's Triangular Wisp,"Chaotic in appearance, these tangled filaments of shocked, glowing gas are spread across planet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus as part of the Veil Nebula. The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant, an expanding cloud born of the death explosion of a massive star. Light from the original supernova explosion likely reached Earth over 5,000 years ago. The glowing filaments are really more like long ripples in a sheet seen almost edge on, remarkably well separated into the glow of ionized hydrogen atoms shown in blue and oxygen in red hues. Also known as the Cygnus Loop and cataloged as NGC 6979, the Veil Nebula now spans about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon. The length of the wisp corresponds to about 30 light years, given its estimated distance of 2,400 light years.  Often identified as Pickering's Triangle for a director of Harvard College Observatory, it is also named for its discoverer, astronomer Williamina Fleming, as Fleming's Triangular Wisp.","fleming, triangular, wisp, chaotic, appearance, tangled, filament, shocked, glowing, spread, planet, earth, constellation, cygnus, part, veil, nebula, large, supernova, remnant, expanding, cloud, born, death, explosion, massive, star, light, original, reached, year, long, ripple, sheet, seen, edge, separated, glow, ionized, hydrogen, atom, shown, blue, oxygen, known, loop, cataloged, span, time, diameter, full, moon, length, corresponds, given, estimated, distance, identified, pickering, triangle, director, harvard, college, observatory, named, discoverer, astronomer"
Ring Galaxy AM 0644-741,"The rim of the large blue galaxy at the right is an immense ring-like structure 150,000 light years in diameter composed of newly formed, extremely bright, massive stars.  AM 0644-741 is known as a ring galaxy and was caused by an immense galaxy collision.  When galaxies collide, they pass through each other and their individual stars rarely come into contact.  The large galaxy's ring-like shape is the result of the gravitational disruption caused by a small intruder galaxy passing through it. When this happens, interstellar gas and dust become compressed, causing a wave of star formation to move out from the impact point like a ripple across the surface of a pond.  Other galaxies in the field of view are background galaxies, not interacting with AM 0644-741. Foreground spiky stars are within our own Milky Way. But the smaller intruder galaxy is caught above and right, near the top of the frame taken by the Hubble Space Telescope.

The Tulip and Cygnus X-1,"This tall telescopic field of view looks out along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the nebula rich constellation Cygnus the Swan. Popularly called the Tulip Nebula, the brightest glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust above center is also found in the 1959 catalog by astronomer Stewart Sharpless as Sh2-101. Nearly 70 light-years across the complex and beautiful Tulip Nebula blossoms about 8,000 light-years away, shown in a Hubble palette image that maps the glow of the nebula's sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen ions into red, green, and blue colors. Ultraviolet radiation from young energetic stars at the edge of the Cygnus OB3 association, including O star HDE 227018, ionizes the atoms and powers the emission from the Tulip Nebula. Also in the field of view is microquasar Cygnus X-1, one of the strongest X-ray sources in planet Earth's sky. Driven by powerful jets from a black hole accretion disk, its fainter bluish curved shock front is only just visible though, directly above the cosmic Tulip's petals near the top of the frame.","tulip, cygnus, tall, telescopic, field, view, look, plane, milky, galaxy, nebula, rich, constellation, swan, called, brightest, glowing, cloud, interstellar, dust, center, found, catalog, stewart, sharpless, sh2-101, light-year, complex, beautiful, blossom, shown, hubble, palette, image, glow, sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, green, blue, color, ultraviolet, radiation, young, energetic, star, edge, association, including, ionizes, atom, power, emission, microquasar, strongest, x-ray, source, planet, earth, driven, powerful, black, hole, accretion, disk, fainter, bluish, curved, shock, front, visible, cosmic, petal, frame"
Mimas in Saturnlight,"Peering from the shadows, the Saturn-facing hemisphere of Mimas lies in near darkness alongside a dramatic sunlit crescent. The mosaic was captured near the Cassini spacecraft's final close approach on January 30, 2017. Cassini's camera was pointed in a nearly sunward direction only 45,000 kilometers from Mimas. The result is one of the highest resolution views of the icy, crater-pocked, 400 kilometer diameter moon. An enhanced version better reveals the Saturn-facing hemisphere of the synchronously rotating moon lit by sunlight reflected from Saturn itself.

Remembering NEOWISE,"It was just last July. If you could see the stars of the Big Dipper, you could find Comet NEOWISE in your evening sky. After sunset denizens of the north could look for the naked-eye comet below the bowl of that famous celestial kitchen utensil and above the northwestern horizon. The comet looked like a fuzzy 'star' with a tail, though probably not so long a tail as in this memorable skyview recorded from the Czech Republic on July 23th, 2020, near the comet's closest approach to planet Earth. Photographs of C/2020 F3 (NEOWISE) often did show the comet's broad dust tail and fainter but separate bluish ion tail extending farther than the eye could follow. Skygazers around the world were delighted to witness Comet NEOWISE, surprise visitor from the outer Solar System.

Pluto in Enhanced Color,"Pluto is more colorful than we can see. Color data and high-resolution images of our Solar System's most famous dwarf planet, taken by the robotic New Horizons spacecraft during its flyby in 2015 July, have been digitally combined to give an enhanced-color view of this ancient world sporting an unexpectedly young surface. The featured enhanced color image is not only esthetically pretty but scientifically useful, making surface regions of differing chemical composition visually distinct. For example, the light-colored heart-shaped Tombaugh Regio on the lower right is clearly shown here to be divisible into two regions that are geologically different, with the leftmost lobe Sputnik Planitia also appearing unusually smooth.

The Hubble Ultra Deep Field in Light and Sound,"Have you heard about the Hubble Ultra-Deep Field?  Either way, you've likely not heard about it like this -- please run your cursor over the featured image and listen!  The Hubble Ultra-Deep Field (HUDF) was created in 2003-2004 with the Hubble Space Telescope staring for a long time toward near-empty space so that distant, faint galaxies would become visible.  One of the most famous images in astronomy, the HUDF is featured here in a vibrant way -- with sonified distances. Pointing to a galaxy will play a note that indicates its approximate redshift. Because redshifts shift light toward the red end of the spectrum of light, they are depicted here by a shift of tone toward the low end of the spectrum of sound.  The further the galaxy, the greater its cosmological redshift (even if it appears blue), and the lower the tone that will be played. The average galaxy in the HUDF is about 10.6 billion light years away and sounds like an F#. What's the most distant galaxy you can find?   Note: Sounds will only play on some browsers.

A Perseid Fireball and the Milky Way,"It was bright and green and flashed as it moved quickly along the Milky Way. It left a trail that took 30 minutes to dissipate.  Given the day, August 12, and the direction, away from Perseus, it was likely a small bit from the nucleus of Comet Swift-Tuttle plowing through the Earth's atmosphere -- and therefore part of the annual Perseids meteor shower.  The astrophotographer captured the fireball as it shot across the sky in 2018 above a valley in Yichang, Hubei, China. The meteor's streak, also caught on video, ended near the direction of Mars on the lower left. Next week, the 2021 Perseids meteor shower will peak again.  This year the Moon will set shortly after the Sun, leaving a night sky ideal for seeing lots of Perseids from dark and clear locations across planet Earth.

EHT Resolves Central Jet from Black Hole in Cen A,"How do supermassive black holes create powerful jets? To help find out, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) imaged the center of the nearby active galaxy Centaurus A.  The cascade of featured inset images shows Cen A from it largest, taking up more sky than many moons, to its now finest, taking up only as much sky as an golf ball on the moon. The new image shows what may look like two jets -- but is actually two sides of a single jet.  This newly discovered jet-edge brightening does not solve the jet-creation mystery, but does imply that the particle outflow is confined by a strong pressure -- possibly involving a magnetic field.  The EHT is a coordination of radio telescopes from around the Earth -- from the Caltech Submillimeter Observatory in Hawaii USA, to ALMA in Chile, to NOEMA in France, and more. The EHT will continue to observe massive, nearby black holes and their energetic surroundings.","resolve, central, black, hole, supermassive, create, powerful, help, find, event, horizon, telescope, imaged, center, active, galaxy, centaurus, cascade, featured, inset, image, show, largest, taking, many, moon, finest, much, golf, ball, look, side, single, discovered, jet-edge, brightening, solve, jet-creation, mystery, imply, particle, outflow, confined, strong, pressure, involving, magnetic, field, coordination, radio, earth, caltech, submillimeter, observatory, hawaii, alma, chile, noema, france, continue, massive, nearby, energetic, surroundings"
Tycho and Clavius,"South is up in this detailed telescopic view across the Moon's rugged southern highlands. Captured on July 20, the lunar landscape features the Moon's young and old, the large craters Tycho and Clavius. About 100 million years young, Tycho is the sharp-walled 85 kilometer diameter crater near center, its 2 kilometer tall central peak in bright sunlight and dark shadow. Debris ejected during the impact that created Tycho still make it the stand out lunar crater when the Moon is near full, producing a highly visible radiating system of light streaks, bright rays that extend across much of the lunar near side. In fact, some of the material collected at the Apollo 17 landing site, about 2,000 kilometers away, likely originated from the Tycho impact.  One of the oldest and largest craters on the Moon's near side, 225 kilometer diameter Clavius is due south (above) of Tycho. Clavius crater's own ray system resulting from its original impact event would have faded long ago. The old crater's worn walls and smooth floor are now overlayed by smaller craters from impacts that occurred after Clavius was formed. Observations by the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy (SOFIA) published in 2020 found water at Clavius. Of course both young Tycho and old Clavius craters are lunar locations in the science fiction epic 2001: A Space Odyssey.","tycho, clavius, south, detailed, telescopic, view, moon, rugged, southern, highland, captured, lunar, landscape, feature, young, large, crater, year, sharp-walled, kilometer, diameter, center, tall, central, peak, bright, sunlight, dark, shadow, debris, ejected, impact, created, make, stand, full, producing, visible, radiating, system, light, streak, extend, much, side, fact, material, collected, apollo, landing, site, likely, originated, oldest, largest, near, resulting, original, event, faded, worn, wall, smooth, floor, overlayed, smaller, occurred, formed, observation, stratospheric, observatory, infrared, astronomy, sofia, published, found, water, course, location, science, fiction, epic, space, odyssey"
Stars and Dust Across Corona Australis,"Cosmic dust clouds cross a rich field of stars in this telescopic vista near the northern boundary of Corona Australis, the Southern Crown. Less than 500 light-years away the dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way. Top to bottom the frame spans about 2 degrees or over 15 light-years at the clouds' estimated distance. At top right is a group of lovely reflection nebulae cataloged as NGC 6726, 6727, 6729, and IC 4812. A characteristic blue color is produced as light from hot stars is reflected by the cosmic dust. The dust also obscures from view stars in the region still in the process of formation. Just above the bluish reflection nebulae a smaller NGC 6729 surrounds young variable star R Coronae Australis. To its right are telltale reddish arcs and loops identified as Herbig Haro objects associated with energetic newborn stars. Magnificent globular star cluster NGC 6723 is at bottom left in the frame. Though NGC 6723 appears to be part of the group, its ancient stars actually lie nearly 30,000 light-years away, far beyond the young stars of the Corona Australis dust clouds.","star, dust, corona, australis, cosmic, cloud, cross, rich, field, telescopic, vista, northern, boundary, southern, crown, light-year, block, light, distant, background, milky, bottom, frame, span, degree, estimated, distance, right, group, lovely, reflection, cataloged, characteristic, blue, color, produced, reflected, obscures, view, region, process, formation, bluish, smaller, surround, young, variable, telltale, reddish, loop, identified, herbig, haro, object, associated, energetic, newborn, magnificent, globular, cluster, left, appears, part, ancient"

A Perseid Below,"rthlings typically watch meteor showers by looking up. But this remarkable view, captured on August 13, 2011 by astronaut Ron Garan, caught a Perseid meteor by looking down. From Garan's perspective onboard the International Space Station orbiting at an altitude of about 380 kilometers, the Perseid meteors streak below, swept up dust left from comet Swift-Tuttle heated to incandescence. The glowing comet dust grains are traveling at about 60 kilometers per second through the denser atmosphere around 100 kilometers above Earth's surface. In this case, the foreshortened meteor flash is right of frame center, below the curving limb of the Earth and a layer of greenish airglow, just below bright star Arcturus. Want to look up at a meteor shower?  You're in luck, as the 2021 Perseids meteor shower peaks this week.

Perseus and the Lost Meteors,"What's the best way to watch a meteor shower?  This question might come up later this week when the annual Perseid Meteor Shower peaks. One thing that is helpful is a dark sky, as demonstrated in the featured composite image of last year's Perseids.  Many more faint meteors are visible on the left image, taken through a very dark sky in Slovakia, than on the right image, taken through a moderately dark sky in the Czech Republic.  The band of the Milky Way Galaxy bridges the two coordinated images, while the meteor shower radiant in the constellation of Perseus is clearly visible on the left. In sum, many faint meteors are lost through a bright sky. Light pollution is shrinking areas across our Earth with dark skies, although inexpensive ways to combat this might be implemented.

Fire in Space,"What does fire look like in space? In the gravity on Earth, heated air rises and expands, causing flames to be teardrop shaped. In the microgravity of the air-filled International Space Station (ISS), however, flames are spheres. Fire is the rapid acquisition of oxygen, and space flames meet new oxygen molecules when they float by randomly from all directions -- creating the enveloping sphere.  In the featured image taken in the ISS's Combustion Integration Rack, a spherical flame envelopes clusters of hot glowing soot.  Without oxygen, say in the vacuum of empty space, a fire would go out immediately.  The many chemical reactions involved with fire are complex, and testing them in microgravity is helping humanity not only to better understand fire -- but how to put out fire, too.","fire, space, look, gravity, earth, heated, rise, expands, causing, flame, teardrop, shaped, microgravity, air-filled, international, station, sphere, rapid, acquisition, oxygen, meet, molecule, float, direction, creating, enveloping, featured, image, taken, combustion, integration, rack, spherical, envelope, cluster, glowing, soot, vacuum, empty, many, chemical, reaction, involved, complex, testing, helping, humanity, understand"
Mammatus Clouds over Saskatchewan,"When do cloud bottoms appear like bubbles? Normally, cloud bottoms are flat. This is because moist warm air that rises and cools will condense into water droplets at a specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  As water droplets grow, an opaque cloud forms.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a thunderstorm.  Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  The mammatus clouds pictured here, lasting only a few minutes, were photographed over Regina, Saskatchewan, Canada, just after a storm in 2012.

A Beautiful Trifid,"The beautiful Trifid Nebula is a cosmic study in contrasts. Also known as M20, it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. But the red emission region roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes is what lends the Trifid its popular name. Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, below and left of the emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region. The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across. Just too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers the area of a full moon in planet Earth's sky.","beautiful, trifid, nebula, cosmic, study, contrast, known, light-year, rich, constellation, sagittarius, star, forming, region, plane, galaxy, illustrate, different, astronomical, emission, dominated, light, hydrogen, atom, blue, reflection, produced, dust, reflecting, starlight, dark, dense, cloud, appear, silhouette, separated, part, obscuring, lane, lends, popular, name, pillar, sculpted, newborn, left, center, famous, hubble, space, telescope, close-up, image, faint, seen, unaided, cover, area, full, moon, planet, earth"
A Perfect Spiral,"If not perfect then this spiral galaxy is at least one of the most photogenic. An island universe of about 100 billion stars, 32 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces, M74 presents a gorgeous face-on view. Classified as an Sc galaxy, the grand design of M74's graceful spiral arms are traced by bright blue star clusters and dark cosmic dust lanes. This sharp composite was constructed from image data recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys.

"Island Universe, Cosmic Sand","Stars in our own Milky Way Galaxy are scattered through this eye-catching field of view. From the early hours after midnight on August 13, the 30 second exposure of the night sky over Busko-Zdroj, Poland records the colorful and bright trail of a Perseid meteor. Seen near the peak of the annual Perseid meteor shower it flashes from lower left to upper right. The hurtling grain of cosmic sand, a piece of dust from periodic comet Swift-Tuttle, vaporized as it passed through planet Earth's atmosphere at almost 60 kilometers per second. Just above and right of center, well beyond the stars of the Milky Way, lies the island universe known as M31 or the Andromeda Galaxy. The Andromeda Galaxy is the most distant object easily visible to the naked-eye, about 2.5 million light-years away. The visible meteor trail begins only about 100 kilometers above Earth's surface, though. It points back to the meteor shower radiant in the constellation Perseus off the lower left edge of the frame.

Perseid Rain,"Comet dust rained down on planet Earth last week, streaking through dark skies in the annual Perseid meteor shower. The featured picture is a composite of many images taken from the same location over the peak night of the Perseids. The umbrella was not needed as a shield from meteors, since they almost entirely evaporate high in the Earth's atmosphere. Many of the component images featured individual Perseids, while one image featured the foreground near Jiuquan City, Gansu Province, China. The stellar background includes the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, appearing nearly vertical, as well as the planets Jupiter and Saturn on the left. Although the comet dust particles are traveling parallel to each other, the resulting shower meteors clearly seem to radiate from a single point on the sky -- the radiant in the eponymous constellation Perseus. The image captured so long an angular field that the curvature of the sky is visible in the trajectory of the Perseids.

Although this type of lightning has only been noted in the past few decades, images of sprites are becoming more common. This sky wasn't unusual because of the nova, visible just above the image center. Novas bright enough to be seen with the unaided eye occur every few years, with pictured Nova RS Ophiuchus discovered about a week ago.

M57: The Ring Nebula from Hubble,"cept for the rings of Saturn, the Ring Nebula (M57) is probably the most famous celestial circle. Its classic appearance is understood to be due to our own perspective, though. The recent mapping of the expanding nebula's 3-D structure, based in part on this clear Hubble image,indicates that the nebula is a relatively dense, donut-like ring wrapped around the middle of a (American) football-shaped cloud of glowing gas. The view from planet Earth looks down the long axis of the football, face-on to the ring. Of course, in this well-studied example of a planetary nebula, the glowing material does not come from planets. Instead, the gaseous shroud represents outer layers expelled from the dying, once sun-like star, now a tiny pinprick of light seen at the nebula's center. Intense ultraviolet light from the hot central star ionizes atoms in the gas. The Ring Nebula is about one light-year across and 2,500 light-years away.

Rings Around the Ring Nebula,"The Ring Nebula (M57), is more complicated than it appears through a small telescope.  The easily visible central ring is about one light-year across, but this remarkably deep exposure - a collaborative effort combining data from three different large telescopes - explores the looping filaments of glowing gas extending much farther from the nebula's central star. This composite image includes red light emitted by hydrogen as well as visible and infrared light. The Ring Nebula is an elongated planetary nebula, a type of nebula created when a Sun-like star evolves to throw off its outer atmosphere to become a white dwarf star.  The Ring Nebula is about 2,500 light-years away toward the musical constellation Lyra.

"Bright Meteor, Starry Sky","Plowing through Earth's atmosphere at 60 kilometers per second, this bright perseid meteor streaks along a starry Milky Way. Captured in dark Portugal skies on August 12, it moves right to left through the frame. Its colorful trail starts near Deneb (alpha Cygni) and ends near Altair (alpha Aquilae), stars of the northern summer triangle. In fact this perseid meteor very briefly outshines both, two of the brightest stars in planet Earth's night. The trail's initial greenish glow is typical of the bright perseid shower meteors. The grains of cosmic sand, swept up dust from periodic comet Swift-Tuttle, are moving fast enough to excite the characteristic green emission of atomic oxygen at altitudes of 100 kilometers or so before vaporizing in an incandescent flash.

Three Perseid Nights,"Frames from a camera that spent three moonless nights under the stars create this composite night skyscape. They were recorded during August 11-13 while planet Earth was sweeping through the dusty trail of comet Swift-Tuttle. One long exposure, untracked for the foreground, and the many star tracking captures of Perseid shower meteors were taken from the village of Magyaregres, Hungary. Each aligned against the background stars, the meteor trails all point back to the annual shower's radiant in the constellation Perseus heroically standing above this rural horizon. Of course the comet dust particles are traveling along trajectories parallel to each other. The radiant effect is due only to perspective, as the parallel tracks appear to converge in the distance against the starry sky.

Triple Transit and Mutual Events,"These three panels feature the Solar System's ruling gas giant Jupiter on August 15 as seen from Cebu City, Philippines, planet Earth. On that date the well-timed telescopic views detail some remarkable performances, transits and mutual events, by Jupiter's Galilean moons. In the top panel, Io is just disappearing into Jupiter's shadow at the far right, but the three other large Jovian moons appear against the planet's banded disk. Brighter Europa and darker Ganymede are at the far left, also casting their two shadows on the gas giant's cloud tops. Callisto is below and right near the planet's edge, the three moons in a triple transit across the face of Jupiter. Moving to the middle panel, shadows of Europa and Ganymede are still visible near center but Ganymede has occulted or passed in front of Europa. The bottom panel captures a rare view of Jovian moons in eclipse while transiting Jupiter, Ganymede's shadow falling on Europa itself. From planet Earth's perspective, similar mutual events, when Galilean moons occult and eclipse each other, can be seen every six years or so when Jupiter is near its own equinox.","triple, transit, mutual, event, panel, feature, solar, system, ruling, giant, jupiter, august, seen, cebu, city, philippine, planet, earth, date, well-timed, telescopic, view, detail, remarkable, performance, galilean, moon, disappearing, shadow, right, large, jovian, appear, banded, disk, brighter, europa, darker, ganymede, left, casting, cloud, callisto, edge, face, moving, middle, visible, center, occulted, passed, front, bottom, capture, rare, eclipse, transiting, falling, perspective, similar, occult, year, equinox"
Explosions from White Dwarf Star RS Oph,"Spectacular explosions keep occurring in the binary star system named RS Ophiuchi.  Every 20 years or so, the red giant star dumps enough hydrogen gas onto its companion white dwarf star to set off a brilliant thermonuclear explosion on the white dwarf's surface.  At about 5,000 light years distant, the resulting nova explosions cause the RS Oph system to brighten up by a huge factor and become visible to the unaided eye.  The red giant star is depicted on the right of the above drawing, while the white dwarf is at the center of the bright accretion disk on the left.  As the stars orbit each other, a stream of gas moves from the giant star to the white dwarf.  Astronomers speculate that at some time in the next 100,000 years, enough matter will have accumulated on the white dwarf to push it over the Chandrasekhar Limit, causing a much more powerful and final explosion known as a supernova. Starting early this month, RS Oph was again seen exploding in a bright nova.","explosion, white, dwarf, star, spectacular, keep, occurring, binary, system, named, ophiuchi, year, giant, dump, enough, hydrogen, companion, brilliant, thermonuclear, surface, light, distant, resulting, nova, cause, brighten, huge, factor, become, visible, unaided, depicted, right, drawing, center, bright, accretion, disk, left, orbit, stream, move, astronomer, speculate, time, matter, accumulated, push, chandrasekhar, limit, causing, much, powerful, final, known, supernova, starting, early, month, seen, exploding"
Abell 3827: Cannibal Cluster Gravitational Lens,"Is that one galaxy or three? Toward the right of the featured Hubble image of the massive galaxy cluster Abell 3827 is what appears to be a most unusual galaxy -- curved and with three centers.  A detailed analysis, however, finds that these are three images of the same background galaxy -- and that there are at least four more images.  Light we see from the single background blue galaxy takes multiple paths through the complex gravity of the cluster, just like a single distant light can take multiple paths through the stem of a wine glass. Studying how clusters like Abell 3827 and their component galaxies deflect distant light gives information about how mass and dark matter are distributed. Abell 3827 is so distant, having a redshift of 0.1, that the light we see from it left about 1.3 billion years ago -- before dinosaurs roamed the Earth. Therefore, the cluster's central galaxies have now surely all coalesced -- in a feast of galactic cannibalism -- into one huge galaxy near the cluster's center.","abell, cannibal, cluster, gravitational, lens, galaxy, right, featured, hubble, image, massive, appears, unusual, curved, center, detailed, analysis, find, background, least, light, single, blue, take, multiple, path, complex, gravity, distant, stem, wine, glass, studying, component, deflect, give, information, mass, dark, matter, distributed, redshift, left, year, dinosaur, roamed, earth, central, coalesced, feast, galactic, cannibalism, huge"
"PDS 70: Disk, Planets, and Moons","It's not the big disk that's attracting the most attention. Although the big planet-forming disk around the star PDS 70 is clearly imaged and itself quite interesting. It's also not the planet on the right, just inside the big disk, that’s being talked about the most.  Although the planet PDS 70c is a newly formed and, interestingly, similar in size and mass to Jupiter. It's the fuzzy patch around the planet PDS 70c that's causing the commotion. That fuzzy patch is thought to be itself a dusty disk that is now forming into moons -- and that has never been seen before. The featured image was taken by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of 66 radio telescopes in the high Atacama Desert of northern Chile.  Based on ALMA data, astronomers infer that the moon-forming exoplanetary disk has a radius similar to our Earth's orbit, and may one day form three or so Luna-sized moons -- not very different from our Jupiter's four.","disk, planet, moon, attracting, attention, planet-forming, star, imaged, interesting, talked, formed, similar, size, mass, jupiter, fuzzy, patch, causing, commotion, thought, dusty, forming, seen, featured, image, taken, large, millimeter, array, alma, radio, telescope, high, atacama, desert, northern, chile, based, data, astronomer, infer, moon-forming, exoplanetary, radius, earth, orbit, form, luna-sized, different"
Solar System Ball Drop,"Does a ball drop faster on Earth, Jupiter, or Uranus?  The featured animation shows a ball dropping from one kilometer high toward the surfaces of famous solar system bodies, assuming no air resistance.  The force of gravity depends on the mass of the attracting object, with higher masses pulling down with greater forces. But gravitational force also depends on distance from the center of gravity, with shorter distances causing the ball to drop faster.  Combining both mass and distance, it might be surprising to see that Uranus pulls the ball down slightly slower than Earth, despite containing over 14 times more mass. This happens because Uranus has a much lower density, which puts its cloud tops further away from its center of mass.  Although the falling ball always speeds up, if you were on the ball you would not feel this acceleration because you would be in free-fall. Of the three planets mentioned, the video demonstrates a ball drops even faster on Jupiter than either Earth and Uranus.","solar, system, ball, drop, earth, jupiter, uranus, featured, animation, show, dropping, kilometer, high, surface, famous, body, assuming, resistance, force, gravity, depends, mass, attracting, object, higher, pulling, greater, gravitational, distance, center, shorter, causing, combining, surprising, pull, slower, containing, time, happens, lower, density, cloud, falling, speed, feel, acceleration, free-fall, planet, mentioned, video, demonstrates"
A Blue Hour Full Moon,"Nature photographers and other fans of planet Earth always look forward to the blue hour. That's the transition in twilight, just before sunrise or after sunset, when the Sun is below the horizon but land and sky are still suffused with a beautiful blue light. After sunset on August 21, this blue hour snapshot captured the nearly full Moon as it rose opposite the Sun, above the rugged Italian Alps from Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Sharing bluish hues with the sky, the rocky pyramid of Monte Antelao, also known as the King of the Dolomites, is the region's prominent alpine peak. The moonlight is yellow, but even so this full Moon was known to some as a seasonal Blue Moon. That's because by one definition the third full Moon of a season with four full moons in it is called a Blue Moon. Recognizing a season as the time between a solstice and an equinox, this season's fourth full Moon will be rising in the blue hour of September 20, just before September's equinox.","blue, hour, full, moon, nature, photographer, planet, earth, look, forward, transition, twilight, sunrise, sunset, horizon, land, suffused, beautiful, light, august, snapshot, captured, rose, opposite, rugged, italian, cortina, d'ampezzo, italy, sharing, bluish, rocky, pyramid, monte, antelao, known, king, dolomite, region, prominent, alpine, peak, moonlight, yellow, seasonal, definition, third, season, called, recognizing, time, solstice, equinox, fourth, rising, september"
Elephant's Trunk and Caravan,"Like an illustration in a galactic Just So Story, the Elephant's Trunk Nebula winds through the emission nebula and young star cluster complex IC 1396, in the high and far off constellation of Cepheus. Also known as vdB 142, seen on the left the cosmic elephant's trunk is over 20 light-years long. Removed by digital processing, no visible stars are in this detailed telescopic close-up view highlighting the bright swept-back ridges that outline pockets of cool interstellar dust and gas. But the dark, tendril-shaped clouds contain the raw material for star formation and hide protostars within. Nearly 3,000 light-years distant, the relatively faint IC 1396 complex covers a large region on the sky, spanning over 5 degrees. This starless rendition spans a 1 degree wide field of view though, about the angular size of 2 full moons.

Mars Rock Rochette,"Taken on mission sol 180 (August 22) this sharp image from a Hazard Camera on the Perseverance rover looks out across a rock strewn floor of Jezero crater on Mars. At 52.5 centimeters (21 inches) in diameter, one of the rover's steerable front wheels is at lower left in the frame. Near center is a large rock nicknamed Rochette. Mission planners don't want to avoid Rochette though. Instead Perseverance will be instructed to reach out with its 2 meter long robotic arm and abrade the rock's surface, to determine whether it has a consistency suitable for obtaining a sample, slightly thicker than a pencil, using the rover's coring bit. Samples collected by Perseverance would be returned to Earth by a future Mars mission.","rock, rochette, taken, mission, august, sharp, image, hazard, camera, perseverance, rover, look, strewn, floor, jezero, crater, centimeter, inch, diameter, steerable, front, wheel, left, frame, center, large, nicknamed, planner, want, avoid, instructed, reach, meter, robotic, abrade, surface, determine, consistency, suitable, obtaining, sample, thicker, pencil, using, coring, collected, returned, earth, future"
Orbits of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids,"Are asteroids dangerous? Some are, but the likelihood of a dangerous asteroid striking the Earth during any given year is low. Because some past mass extinction events have been linked to asteroid impacts, however, humanity has made it a priority to find and catalog those asteroids that may one day affect life on Earth. Pictured here are the orbits of the over 1,000 known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These documented tumbling boulders of rock and ice are over 140 meters across and will pass within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth -- about 20 times the distance to the Moon. Although none of them will strike the Earth in the next 100 years -- not all PHAs have been discovered, and past 100 years, many orbits become hard to predict. Were an asteroid of this size to impact the Earth, it could raise dangerous tsunamis, for example. To investigate Earth-saving strategies, NASA's  Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) is planned for launch later this year. Of course rocks and ice bits of much smaller size strike the Earth every day, usually pose no danger, and sometimes creating memorable fireball and meteor displays.","orbit, hazardous, asteroid, dangerous, likelihood, striking, earth, given, year, mass, extinction, event, linked, impact, humanity, made, priority, find, catalog, affect, life, pictured, known, phas, documented, tumbling, boulder, rock, meter, kilometer, time, distance, moon, none, strike, discovered, many, become, hard, predict, size, raise, tsunami, example, investigate, earth-saving, strategy, nasa, double, redirection, test, dart, planned, launch, course, much, smaller, pose, danger, creating, memorable, fireball, meteor, display"
A Fire Rainbow over West Virginia,"What's happening to this cloud? Ice crystals in a distant cirrus cloud are acting like little floating prisms.  Known informally as a fire rainbow for its flame-like appearance, a circumhorizon arc appears parallel to the horizon. For a circumhorizontal arc to be visible, the Sun must be at least 58 degrees high in a sky where cirrus clouds present below --  in this case cirrus fibrates.  The numerous, flat, hexagonal ice-crystals that compose the cirrus cloud must be aligned horizontally to properly refract sunlight in a collectively similar manner.  Therefore, circumhorizontal arcs are somewhat unusual to see.  The featured fire rainbow was photographed earlier this month near North Fork Mountain in West Virginia, USA.","fire, rainbow, west, virginia, happening, cloud, crystal, distant, cirrus, acting, little, floating, prism, known, flame-like, appearance, circumhorizon, appears, parallel, horizon, circumhorizontal, visible, least, degree, high, present, case, fibrates, numerous, flat, hexagonal, ice-crystals, compose, aligned, properly, refract, sunlight, similar, manner, unusual, featured, photographed, month, north, fork, mountain"
A Blue Moon in Exaggerated Colors,"The Moon is normally seen in subtle shades of grey or gold.  But small, measurable color differences have been greatly exaggerated to make this telescopic, multicolored, moonscape captured during the Moon's full phase.  The different colors are recognized to correspond to real differences in the chemical makeup of the lunar surface.  Blue hues reveal titanium rich areas while orange and purple colors show regions relatively poor in titanium and iron.  The familiar Sea of Tranquility, or Mare Tranquillitatis, is the blue area toward the upper right.  White lines radiate across the orange-hued southern lunar highlands from 85-kilometer wide ray-crater Tycho at bottom right.  The full moon that occurred earlier this month could be counted as a seasonal blue moon because it was, unusually, the third of four full moons to occur during northern summer (and hence southern winter).  The featured 272-image composite demonstrates that the full Moon is always blue, but usually not blue enough in hue to ooh.

Dancing Ghosts: Curved Jets from Active Galaxies,"Why would galaxies emit jets that look like ghosts?  And furthermore, why do they appear to be dancing?  The curled and fluffy jets from the supermassive black holes at the centers of two host galaxies (top center and lower left) are unlike anything seen before.  They were found by astronomers using the Australian Square Kilometer Array Pathfinder (ASKAP) radio telescope when creating maps tracing the evolution of galaxies.  Images preceding this Evolutionary Map of the Universe survey only showed amorphous blobs.  Eventually, comparisons of relative amounts of energy emitted revealed the glowing elongated structures were created by electrons streaming around magnetic field lines.  Overlaying the radio data on an optical view of the sky (Dark Energy Survey) confirmed that the electron streams originated from the centers of active galaxies. Usually such Active Galactic Nuclei (AGN) produce straight jets.  A leading hypothesis for the geometric origin of these unusually graceful shapes involves the flow of large-scale intergalactic winds.

M51: The Whirlpool Galaxy,"Find the Big Dipper and follow the handle away from the dipper's bowl until you get to the last bright star. Then, just slide your telescope a little south and west and you'll come upon this stunning pair of interacting galaxies, the 51st entry in Charles Messier's famous catalog. Perhaps the original spiral nebula, the large galaxy with well defined spiral structure is also cataloged as NGC 5194. Its spiral arms and dust lanes clearly sweep in front of its companion galaxy (top), NGC 5195. The pair are about 31 million light-years distant and officially lie within the angular boundaries of the small constellation Canes Venatici.

NGC 7023: The Iris Nebula,"These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away, in the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus. Called the Iris Nebula, NGC 7023 is not the only nebula to evoke the imagery of flowers. Still, this deep telescopic image shows off the Iris Nebula's range of colors and symmetries, embedded in surrounding fields of interstellar dust. Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot, young star. The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish photoluminesence as some dust grains effectively convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. Infrared observations indicate that this nebula contains complex carbon molecules known as PAHs.

Although our Moon may appear small next to the Earth, no other planet in our Solar System has a satellite so comparable in size .  The Sun, far off to the right, illuminated about half of each sphere, and shows the spinning Earth's white clouds, blue oceans, and tan continents.","earth, moon, photographed, spectacular, time, occurred, year, jupiter-bound, galileo, spacecraft, zoomed, past, home, planetary, system, robotic, watched, earth-moon, separation, natural, satellite, glided, world, featured, video, combine, historic, color-enhanced, image, appear, small, next, planet, solar, comparable, size, illuminated, half, sphere, show, spinning, white, cloud, blue, ocean, continent"
Firefly Milky Way over Russia,"It started with a pine tree. The idea was to photograph a statuesque pine in front of the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy. And the plan, carried out two months ago, was successful -- they both appear prominently. But the resulting 3-frame panorama captured much more. Colorful stars, for example, dot the distant background, with bright Altair visible on the upper left. The planet Saturn, a bit closer, was captured just over the horizon on the far left. Just beyond the Earth's atmosphere, seen in the upper right, an Earth-orbiting satellite was caught leaving a streak during the 25-second exposure. The Earth's atmosphere itself was surprisingly visible -- as green airglow across the image top. Finally, just by chance, there was a firefly. Do you see it? Near the image bottom, the firefly blinked in yellow several times as it fluttered before the rolling hills above Milogradovka River in Primorsky Krai, Russia.

NGC 520: Colliding Galaxies from Hubble,"Is this one galaxy or two?  The jumble of stars, gas, and dust that is NGC 520 is now thought to incorporate the remains of two separate disk galaxies.  A defining component of NGC 520 -- as seen in great detail in the featured image from the Hubble Space Telescope -- is its band of intricately interlaced dust running vertically down the spine of the colliding galaxies. A similar looking collision might be expected in a few billion years when our disk  Milky Way Galaxy to collides with our large-disk galactic neighbor Andromeda (M31).  The collision that defines NGC 520 started about 300 million years ago.  Also known as Arp 157, NGC 520 lies about 100 million light years distant, spans about 100 thousand light years, and can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Fish (Pisces). Although the speeds of stars in NGC 520 are fast, the distances are so vast that the battling pair will surely not change its shape noticeably during our lifetimes.","colliding, galaxy, hubble, jumble, star, dust, thought, incorporate, remains, separate, disk, defining, component, seen, great, detail, featured, image, space, telescope, band, interlaced, running, spine, similar, looking, collision, expected, year, milky, collides, large-disk, galactic, neighbor, andromeda, defines, started, known, light, distant, span, thousand, small, constellation, fish, pisces, speed, fast, distance, vast, battling, pair, change, shape, lifetime"
The Deep Sky Toward Andromeda,"What surrounds the Andromeda galaxy?  Out in space, Andromeda (M31) is closely surrounded by several small satellite galaxies, and further out it is part of the Local Group of Galaxies -- of which our Milky Way galaxy is also a member. On the sky, however, gas clouds local to our Milky Way appear to surround M31 -- not unlike how water clouds in Earth's atmosphere may appear to encompass our Moon.  The gas clouds toward Andromeda, however, are usually too faint to see.  Enter the featured 45-degree long image -- one of the deeper images yet taken of the broader Andromeda region. This image, sensitive to light specifically emitted by hydrogen gas, shows these faint and unfamiliar clouds in tremendous detail. But the image captures more.  At the image top is the Triangulum galaxy (M33), the third largest galaxy in the Local Group and the furthest object that can be seen with the unaided eye.  Below M33 is the bright Milky-Way star Mirach. The image is the digital accumulation of several long exposures taken from 2018 to 2021 from Pulsnitz, Germany.","deep, andromeda, surround, galaxy, space, surrounded, several, small, satellite, part, local, group, milky, member, cloud, appear, water, earth, atmosphere, encompass, moon, faint, featured, 45-degree, long, image, deeper, taken, broader, region, sensitive, light, emitted, hydrogen, show, unfamiliar, tremendous, detail, capture, triangulum, third, largest, furthest, object, seen, unaided, bright, star, mirach, digital, accumulation, exposure, pulsnitz, germany"
M16 Close Up,"A star cluster around 2 million years young surrounded by natal clouds of dust and glowing gas, M16 is also known as The Eagle Nebula. This beautifully detailed image of the region adopts the colorful Hubble palette and includes cosmic sculptures made famous in Hubble Space Telescope close-ups of the starforming complex. Described as elephant trunks or Pillars of Creation, dense, dusty columns rising near the center are light-years in length but are gravitationally contracting to form stars. Energetic radiation from the cluster stars erodes material near the tips, eventually exposing the embedded new stars. Extending from the ridge of bright emission left of center is another dusty starforming column known as the Fairy of Eagle Nebula. M16 lies about 7,000 light-years away, an easy target for binoculars or small telescopes in a nebula rich part of the sky toward the split constellation Serpens Cauda (the tail of the snake).","star, cluster, year, young, surrounded, natal, cloud, dust, glowing, known, eagle, nebula, detailed, image, region, adopts, colorful, hubble, palette, includes, cosmic, sculpture, made, famous, space, telescope, close-ups, starforming, complex, described, elephant, trunk, pillar, creation, dense, dusty, column, rising, center, light-year, length, contracting, form, energetic, radiation, erodes, material, exposing, embedded, extending, ridge, bright, emission, left, fairy, easy, target, binoculars, small, rich, part, split, constellation, serpens, cauda, tail, snake"
Rosetta's Comet in View,"Faint comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) sweeps past background stars in the constellation Taurus and even fainter distant galaxies in this telescopic frame from September 7. About 5 years ago, this comet's 4 kilometer spanning, double-lobed nucleus became the final resting place of robots from planet Earth, following the completion of the historic Rosetta mission to the comet. After wandering out beyond the orbit of Jupiter, Churyumov-Gerasimenko is now returning along its 6.4 year periodic orbit toward its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun, on November 2. On November 12, the comet's perigee, its closest approach to Earth, will bring it within about 0.42 astronomical units. Telescopes should still be required to view it even at its brightest, predicted to be in late November and December. On September 7 Rosetta's comet was about 0.65 astronomical units away or about 5.4 light-minutes from our fair planet.","rosetta, comet, view, faint, churyumov-gerasimenko, sweep, past, background, star, constellation, taurus, distant, galaxy, telescopic, frame, september, year, kilometer, spanning, double-lobed, nucleus, became, final, resting, place, robot, planet, earth, following, completion, historic, mission, wandering, orbit, jupiter, returning, periodic, next, perihelion, closest, approach, november, perigee, bring, astronomical, unit, telescope, required, predicted, late, december, light-minutes, fair"
Saturn at Night,"Still bright in planet Earth's night skies, good telescopic views of Saturn and its beautiful rings often make it a star at star parties. But this stunning view of Saturn's rings and night side just isn't possible from telescopes closer to the Sun than the outer planet. They can only bring Saturn's day into view. In fact, this image of Saturn's slender sunlit crescent with night's shadow cast across its broad and complex ring system was captured by the Cassini spacecraft. A robot spacecraft from planet Earth, Cassini called Saturn orbit home for 13 years before it was directed to dive into the atmosphere of the gas giant on September 15, 2017. This magnificent mosaic is composed of frames recorded by Cassini's wide-angle camera only two days before its grand final plunge. Saturn's night will not be seen again until another spaceship from Earth calls.","saturn, night, bright, planet, earth, good, telescopic, view, beautiful, ring, make, star, party, stunning, side, possible, telescope, closer, outer, bring, fact, image, slender, sunlit, crescent, shadow, cast, broad, complex, system, captured, cassini, spacecraft, robot, called, orbit, home, year, directed, dive, atmosphere, giant, september, magnificent, mosaic, composed, frame, recorded, wide-angle, camera, grand, final, plunge, seen, spaceship, call"
A Spiral Aurora over Iceland,"What's happened to the sky? Aurora! Captured in 2015, this aurora was noted by Icelanders for its great brightness and quick development. The aurora resulted from a solar storm, with high energy particles bursting out from the Sun and through a crack in Earth's protective magnetosphere a few days later. Although a spiral pattern can be discerned, creative humans might imagine the complex glow as an atmospheric apparition of any number of common icons. In the foreground of the featured image is the Ölfusá River while the lights illuminate a bridge in Selfoss City. Just beyond the low clouds is a nearly full Moon. The liveliness of the Sun -- and likely the resulting auroras on Earth -- is slowly increasing as the Sun emerges from a Solar minimum, a historically quiet period in its 11-year cycle.","spiral, aurora, iceland, happened, captured, noted, icelander, great, brightness, quick, development, resulted, solar, storm, high, energy, particle, bursting, crack, earth, protective, pattern, discerned, creative, human, imagine, complex, glow, atmospheric, apparition, number, common, icon, foreground, featured, image, ölfusá, river, light, illuminate, bridge, selfoss, city, cloud, full, moon, liveliness, likely, resulting, increasing, emerges, minimum, quiet, period, 11-year, cycle"
Night Sky Reflected,"What's that in the mirror? In the featured image of the dark southern sky, the three brightest galaxies of the night are all relatively easy to identify. Starting from the left, these are the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), and part of the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy. All three are also seen reflected in a shallow pool of water. But what is seen in the mirror being positioned by the playful astrophotographer? Dust clouds near the center of our Milky Way -- and the planet Jupiter.  The composite was carefully planned and composed from images captured from the same camera in the same location and during the same night in mid-2019 in Mostardas, south Brazil.

Mars Panorama 360 from Curiosity,"Which way up Mount Sharp? In early September, the robotic rover Curiosity continued its ascent up the central peak of Gale Crater, searching for more clues about ancient water and further evidence that Mars could once have been capable of supporting life.  On this recent Martian morning, before exploratory drilling, the rolling rover took this 360-degree panorama, in part to help Curiosity's human team back on Earth access the landscape and chart possible future routes.  In the horizontally-compressed featured image, an amazing vista across Mars was captured, complete with layered hills, red rocky ground, gray drifting sand, and a dusty atmosphere. The hill just left of center has been dubbed Maria Gordon Notch in honor of a famous Scottish geologist.  The current plan is to direct Curiosity to approach, study, and pass just to the right of Gordon Notch on its exploratory trek.","panorama, curiosity, mount, sharp, early, september, robotic, rover, continued, ascent, central, peak, gale, crater, searching, clue, ancient, water, evidence, capable, supporting, life, recent, martian, morning, exploratory, drilling, rolling, took, 360-degree, part, help, human, team, earth, access, landscape, chart, possible, future, route, horizontally-compressed, featured, image, amazing, vista, captured, complete, layered, hill, rocky, ground, gray, drifting, sand, dusty, left, center, dubbed, maria, gordon, notch, honor, famous, scottish, geologist, current, plan, direct, approach, study, right, trek"
Cyclone Paths on Planet Earth,"Where on Earth do cyclones go? Usually known as hurricanes when in the Atlantic Ocean and typhoons when in the Pacific, the featured map shows the path of all major storms from 1985 through 2005.  The map shows graphically that cyclones usually occur over water, which makes sense since evaporating warm water gives them energy. The map also shows that cyclones never cross -- and rarely approach -- the Earth's equator, since the Coriolis effect goes to zero there, and cyclones need the Coriolis force to circulate. The Coriolis force also causes cyclone paths to arc away from the equator. Although long-term trends remain a topic of research, evidence indicates that hurricanes have become, on the average, more powerful in the North Atlantic over the past 30 years, and their power is projected to keep increasing.

North America and the Pelican,"Fans of our fair planet might recognize the outlines of these cosmic clouds. On the left, bright emission outlined by dark, obscuring dust lanes seems to trace a continental shape, lending the popular name North America Nebula to the emission region cataloged as NGC 7000. To the right, just off the North America Nebula's east coast, is IC 5070, whose avian profile suggests the Pelican Nebula.  The two bright nebulae are about 1,500 light-years away, part of the same large and complex star forming region, almost as nearby as the better-known Orion Nebula. At that distance, the 3 degree wide field of view would span 80 light-years. This careful cosmic portrait uses narrow band images combined to highlight the bright ionization fronts and the characteristic glow from atomic hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen gas. These nebulae can be seen with binoculars from a dark location.

Video: Flash on Jupiter,"There has been a flash on Jupiter. A few days ago, several groups monitoring our Solar System's largest planet noticed a two-second long burst of light. Such flashes have been seen before, with the most famous being a series of impactor strikes in 1994. Then, fragments of Comet Shoemaker-Levy 9 struck  Jupiter leaving dark patches that lasted for months. Since then, at least seven impacts have been recorded on Jupiter -- usually discovered by amateur astronomers. In the featured video, variations in the Earth's atmosphere cause Jupiter's image to shimmer when, suddenly, a bright flash appears just left of center.  Io and its shadow are visible on the right. What hit Jupiter will likely never be known, but considering what we do know of the nearby Solar System, it was likely a piece of rock and ice -- perhaps the size of a bus -- that broke off long-ago from a passing comet or asteroid.","video, flash, jupiter, several, group, monitoring, solar, system, largest, planet, noticed, two-second, long, burst, light, seen, famous, series, impactor, strike, fragment, comet, shoemaker-levy, struck, leaving, dark, patch, lasted, month, least, impact, recorded, discovered, amateur, astronomer, featured, variation, earth, atmosphere, cause, image, shimmer, bright, appears, left, center, shadow, visible, right, likely, known, considering, know, piece, rock, size, broke, long-ago, passing, asteroid"
Rubin's Galaxy,"In this Hubble Space Telescope image the bright, spiky stars lie in the foreground toward the heroic northern constellation Perseus and well within our own Milky Way galaxy. In sharp focus beyond is UGC 2885, a giant spiral galaxy about 232 million light-years distant. Some 800,000 light-years across compared to the Milky Way's diameter of 100,000 light-years or so, it has around 1 trillion stars. That's about 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way. Part of an investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and astronomer Vera Rubin's pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies. Her work was the first to convincingly demonstrate the dominating presence of dark matter in our universe.","rubin, galaxy, hubble, space, telescope, image, bright, spiky, star, foreground, heroic, northern, constellation, perseus, milky, sharp, focus, giant, spiral, light-year, distant, compared, diameter, time, many, part, investigation, understand, grow, enormous, size, interesting, voyage, astronomer, vera, pioneering, study, rotation, work, demonstrate, dominating, presence, dark, matter, universe"
Rings and Seasons of Saturn,"On Saturn, the rings tell you the season. On Earth, Wednesday marks an equinox, the time when the  Earth's equator tilts directly toward the Sun. Since Saturn's grand rings orbit along the planet's equator, these rings appear most prominent -- from the direction of the Sun -- when the spin axis of Saturn points toward the Sun. Conversely, when Saturn's spin axis points to the side, an equinox occurs and the edge-on rings are hard to see from not only the Sun -- but Earth. In the featured montage, images of Saturn between the years of 2004 and 2015 have been superposed to show the giant planet passing from southern summer toward northern summer. Saturn was as close as it can get to planet Earth last month, and this month the ringed giant is still bright and visible throughout much of the night","ring, season, saturn, tell, earth, wednesday, mark, equinox, time, equator, tilt, grand, orbit, planet, appear, prominent, direction, spin, axis, point, side, occurs, edge-on, hard, featured, montage, image, year, superposed, show, giant, passing, southern, summer, northern, close, last, month, ringed, bright, visible, much, night"
Lynds Dark Nebula 1251,"Stars are forming in Lynds Dark Nebula (LDN) 1251. About 1,000 light-years away and drifting above the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the dusty molecular cloud is part of a complex of dark nebulae mapped toward the Cepheus flare region. Across the spectrum, astronomical explorations of the obscuring interstellar clouds reveal energetic shocks and outflows associated with newborn stars, including the telltale reddish glow from scattered Herbig-Haro objects hiding in the image. Distant background galaxies also lurk on the scene, almost buried behind the dusty expanse. This alluring view spans over two full moons on the sky, or 17 light-years at the estimated distance of LDN 1251.","lynds, dark, nebula, star, forming, light-year, drifting, plane, milky, galaxy, dusty, molecular, cloud, part, complex, mapped, cepheus, flare, region, spectrum, astronomical, exploration, obscuring, interstellar, reveal, energetic, shock, outflow, associated, newborn, including, telltale, reddish, glow, scattered, herbig-haro, object, hiding, image, distant, background, lurk, scene, buried, expanse, alluring, view, span, full, moon, estimated, distance"
Sun Spot Hill,"Is this giant orange ball about to roll down that tree-lined hill? No, because the giant orange ball is actually the Sun. Our Solar System's central star was captured rising beyond a hill on Earth twelve days ago complete with a delightfully detailed foreground.  The Sun's disk showed five sunspots, quite a lot considering that during the solar minimum in solar activity of the past few years, most days showed no spots. A close look at the hill -- Sierra del Cid in Perter, Spain -- reveals not only silhouetted pine trees, but silhouetted people -- by coincidence three brothers of the photographer.  The trees and brothers were about 3.5-kilometers away during the morning of the well-planned image. A dark filter muted the usually brilliant Sun and brought up great detail on the lower sunspots.  Within a few minutes, the Sun rose far above the hill, while within a week, the sunspots rotated around the Sun, out of view. The captured scene, however, is now frozen in time for all to enjoy.","spot, hill, giant, orange, ball, roll, tree-lined, solar, system, central, star, captured, rising, earth, twelve, complete, detailed, foreground, disk, showed, sunspot, considering, minimum, activity, year, close, look, sierra, perter, spain, reveals, silhouetted, pine, tree, people, coincidence, brother, 3.5-kilometers, morning, well-planned, image, dark, filter, muted, brilliant, brought, great, detail, minute, rose, week, rotated, view, scene, frozen, time, enjoy"
Equinox on a Spinning Earth,"When does the line between night and day become vertical? Today. Today is an equinox on planet Earth, a time of year when day and night are most nearly equal. At an equinox, the Earth's terminator -- the dividing line between day and night -- becomes vertical and connects the north and south poles. The featured time-lapse video demonstrates this by displaying an entire year on planet Earth in twelve seconds. From geosynchronous orbit, the Meteosat 9 satellite recorded these infrared images of the Earth every day at the same local time.  The video started at the September 2010 equinox with the terminator line being vertical. As the Earth revolved around the Sun, the terminator was seen to tilt in a way that provides less daily sunlight to the northern hemisphere, causing winter in the north. As the year progressed, the March 2011 equinox arrived halfway through the video, followed by the terminator tilting the other way, causing winter in the southern hemisphere -- and summer in the north. The captured year ends again with the September equinox, concluding another of billions of trips the Earth has taken -- and will take -- around the Sun.","spinning, earth, line, night, become, vertical, today, equinox, planet, time, year, equal, terminator, dividing, becomes, connects, south, pole, featured, time-lapse, video, demonstrates, displaying, entire, twelve, second, geosynchronous, orbit, meteosat, satellite, recorded, infrared, image, local, started, september, revolved, seen, tilt, provides, daily, sunlight, causing, north, progressed, march, arrived, followed, tilting, winter, southern, summer, captured, concluding, trip, taken, take"
Harvest Moon Trail,"Famed in festival, story, and song the best known full moon is the Harvest Moon. For northern hemisphere dwellers that's a traditional name of the full moon nearest the September equinox. Seen from Saunderstown, Rhode Island, planet Earth, this Harvest Moon left a broad streak of warm hues as it rose through a twilight sky over the Newport Bridge. On September 20 its trail was captured in a single 22 minute exposure using a dense filter and a digital camera. Only two days later the September equinox marked a change of season and the beginning of autumn in the north. In fact, recognizing a season as the time between solstice and equinox, this Harvest Moon was the fourth full moon of the season, coming just before the astronomical end of northern summer.","harvest, moon, trail, famed, festival, story, song, known, full, dweller, traditional, name, nearest, september, equinox, seen, saunderstown, rhode, island, planet, earth, left, broad, streak, warm, rose, twilight, newport, bridge, captured, single, minute, exposure, using, dense, filter, digital, camera, marked, change, season, beginning, autumn, north, fact, recognizing, time, solstice, fourth, coming, astronomical, northern, summer"
Perseid Outburst at Westmeath Lookout,"This year an outburst of Perseid meteors surprised skywatchers. The reliable meteor shower's peak was predicted for the night of August 12/13. But persistent visual observers in North America were deluged with a startling Perseid shower outburst a day later, with reports of multiple meteors per minute and sometimes per second in the early hours of August 14. The shower radiant is high in a dark night sky in this composite image. It painstakingly registers the trails of 282 Perseids captured during the stunning outburst activity between 0650 UT (02:50am EDT) and 0900 UT (05:00am EDT) on August 14 from Westmeath Lookout, Ontario. Of course the annual Perseid meteor shower is associated with planet Earth's passage through dusty debris from periodic comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle. The 2021 outburst could have been caused by an unanticipated encounter with the Perseid Filament, a denser ribbon of dust inside the broader debris zone.","perseid, westmeath, year, meteor, surprised, skywatchers, reliable, shower, peak, predicted, night, persistent, visual, deluged, startling, report, multiple, minute, second, early, hour, radiant, high, dark, composite, image, register, trail, perseids, captured, stunning, activity, lookout, ontario, course, annual, associated, planet, earth, passage, dusty, debris, periodic, comet, 109p/swift-tuttle, outburst, caused, unanticipated, encounter, filament, denser, ribbon, dust, broader, zone"
The Bubble and the Star Cluster,"To the eye, this cosmic composition nicely balances the Bubble Nebula at the right with open star cluster M52. The pair would be lopsided on other scales, though. Embedded in a complex of interstellar dust and gas and blown by the winds from a single, massive O-type star, the Bubble Nebula, also known as NGC 7635, is a mere 10 light-years wide.  On the other hand, M52 is a rich open cluster of around a thousand stars. The cluster is about 25 light-years across. Seen toward the northern boundary of Cassiopeia, distance estimates for the Bubble Nebula and associated cloud complex are around 11,000 light-years, while star cluster M52 lies nearly 5,000 light-years away. The wide telescopic field of view spans about 1.5 degrees on the sky or three times the apparent size of a full Moon.","bubble, star, cluster, cosmic, composition, balance, right, open, pair, lopsided, scale, embedded, complex, interstellar, dust, blown, wind, single, massive, o-type, nebula, known, mere, light-year, wide, hand, rich, seen, northern, boundary, cassiopeia, distance, estimate, associated, cloud, telescopic, field, view, span, degree, time, apparent, size, full, moon"
The Red Square Nebula,"How did a round star create this square nebula? No one is quite sure. The round star, known as MWC 922 and possibly part of a multiple star system, appears at the center of the Red Square Nebula.  The featured image combines infrared exposures from the Hale Telescope on Mt. Palomar in California, and the Keck-2 Telescope on Mauna Kea in Hawaii.  A leading progenitor hypothesis for the square nebula is that the central star or stars somehow expelled cones of gas during a late developmental stage. For MWC 922, these cones happen to incorporate nearly right angles and be visible from the sides.  Supporting evidence for the cone hypothesis includes radial spokes in the image that might run along the cone walls. Researchers speculate that the cones viewed from another angle would appear similar to the gigantic rings of supernova 1987A, possibly indicating that a star in MWC 922 might one day itself explode in a similar supernova.","square, nebula, round, star, create, quite, sure, known, part, multiple, system, appears, featured, image, combine, infrared, exposure, hale, telescope, palomar, california, keck-2, mauna, hawaii, leading, progenitor, hypothesis, central, expelled, cone, late, developmental, stage, happen, incorporate, right, angle, visible, side, supporting, evidence, includes, radial, spoke, wall, researcher, speculate, viewed, appear, similar, gigantic, ring, supernova, indicating, explode"
Unwrapped: Five Decade Old Lunar Selfie,"Here is one of the most famous pictures from the Moon -- but digitally reversed. Apollo 11 landed on the moon in 1969 and soon thereafter many pictures were taken, including an iconic picture of Buzz Aldrin taken by Neil Armstrong. The original image captured not only the magnificent desolation of an unfamiliar world, but Armstrong himself reflected in Aldrin's curved visor.  Enter modern digital technology. In the featured image, the spherical distortion from Aldrin's helmet has been reversed.  The result is the famous picture -- but now featuring Armstrong himself from Aldrin's perspective. Even so, since Armstrong took the picture, the image is effectively a five-decade old lunar selfie.  The original visor reflection is shown on the left, while Earth hangs in the lunar sky on the upper right. A foil-wrapped leg of the Eagle lander is prominently visible.  Preparations to return humans to the Moon in the next few years include the Artemis program, an international collaboration led by NASA.","unwrapped, decade, lunar, selfie, famous, picture, moon, reversed, apollo, landed, many, taken, including, iconic, buzz, armstrong, original, image, captured, magnificent, desolation, unfamiliar, world, reflected, aldrin, curved, visor, enter, modern, digital, technology, featured, spherical, distortion, helmet, result, featuring, perspective, took, five-decade, reflection, shown, left, earth, hang, upper, right, foil-wrapped, eagle, visible, preparation, return, human, next, year, include, artemis, program, international, collaboration, nasa"
Night of the Perseids,"Have you ever experienced a meteor shower? To help capture the wonder, a video was taken during the peak of the recent Perseid meteor shower above the Indian Astronomical Observatory in Hanle, India, high up in the Himalayan mountains.  Night descends as the video begins, with the central plane of our Milky Way Galaxy approaching from the left and Earth-orbiting satellites zipping by overhead. During the night, the flash of meteors that usually takes less than a second is artificially extended.  The green glow of most meteors is typically caused by vaporizing nickel. As the video continues, Orion rises and meteors flare above the 2-meter Himalayan Chandra Telescope and the seven barrels of the High Energy Gamma Ray Telescope (Hagar). The 2 minute 30 second movie ends with the Sun rising, preceded by a false dawn of zodiacal light.","night, perseids, experienced, meteor, shower, help, capture, wonder, video, taken, peak, recent, perseid, indian, astronomical, observatory, hanle, india, high, himalayan, mountain, descends, begin, central, plane, milky, galaxy, approaching, left, earth-orbiting, satellite, zipping, overhead, flash, take, less, second, extended, green, glow, caused, vaporizing, nickel, continues, orion, rise, flare, 2-meter, chandra, telescope, barrel, energy, gamma, hagar, minute, movie, rising, preceded, false, dawn, zodiacal, light"
Gigantic Jet Lightning from Puerto Rico,"Have you ever seen a gigantic jet?  They are extremely rare but tremendously powerful. Gigantic jets are a type of lightning discharge documented only this century that occur between some thunderstorms and the Earth's ionosphere high above them.  Pictured above is the middle and top of one such jet caught last week by a lightning and meteor camera from Puerto Rico, USA.  The jet traversed perhaps 70 kilometers in just under one second.  Gigantic jets are much different from regular cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning. The bottoms of gigantic jets appear similar in appearance to another type cloud-to-above strike called blue jets, while the tops appear similar to upper-atmosphere red sprites. Although the mechanism and trigger that causes gigantic jets is a topic of research, it is clear that the jets reduce charge imbalance between different parts of Earth's atmosphere.  A good way to look for gigantic jets is to watch a powerful but distant thunderstorm from a clear location.

The Hydrogen Clouds of M33,"Gorgeous spiral galaxy M33 seems to have more than its fair share of glowing hydrogen gas. A prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy and lies a mere 3 million light-years away.  Sprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core, M33's giant HII regions are some of the largest known stellar nurseries, sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars. Intense ultraviolet radiation from the luminous massive stars ionizes the surrounding hydrogen gas and ultimately produces the characteristic red glow. To highlight the HII regions in this telescopic image, broadband data used to produce a color view of the galaxy were combined with narrowband data recorded through a hydrogen-alpha filter, transmitting the light of the strongest hydrogen emission line. Close-ups of cataloged HII regions appear in the sidebar insets. Use the individual reference number to find their location within the Triangulum Galaxy. For example, giant HII region NGC604 is identified in an inset on the right and appears at position number 15. That's about 4 o'clock from galaxy center in this portrait of M33.","hydrogen, cloud, gorgeous, spiral, galaxy, seems, fair, share, glowing, prominent, member, local, group, known, triangulum, light-year, sprawling, loose, wind, core, giant, region, largest, stellar, nursery, site, formation, short-lived, massive, star, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, luminous, ionizes, surrounding, produce, characteristic, glow, highlight, telescopic, image, broadband, data, used, color, view, combined, recorded, hydrogen-alpha, filter, transmitting, light, strongest, emission, line, close-ups, cataloged, appear, sidebar, inset, individual, reference, number, find, location, example, identified, right, appears, position, center, portrait"
The Central Milky Way from Lagoon to Pipe,"Dark markings and colorful clouds inhabit this stellar landscape. The deep and expansive view spans more than 30 full moons across crowded star fields toward the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard, the obscuring interstellar dust clouds seen toward the right include B59, B72, B77 and B78, part of the Ophiuchus molecular cloud complex a mere 450 light-years away. To the eye their combined shape suggests a pipe stem and bowl, and so the dark nebula's popular name is the Pipe Nebula. Three bright nebulae gathered on the left are stellar nurseries some 5,000 light-years distant toward the constellation Sagittarius. In the 18th century astronomer Charles Messier included two of them in his catalog of bright clusters and nebulae; M8, the largest of the triplet, and colorful M20 just above. The third prominent emission region includes NGC 6559 at the far left. Itself divided by obscuring dust lanes, M20 is also known as the Trifid. M8's popular moniker is the Lagoon Nebula.","central, milky, lagoon, pipe, dark, marking, colorful, cloud, inhabit, stellar, landscape, deep, expansive, view, span, full, moon, crowded, star, field, center, galaxy, cataloged, 20th, century, astronomer, obscuring, interstellar, dust, seen, right, include, part, molecular, complex, light-year, combined, shape, suggests, stem, bowl, nebula, popular, name, bright, gathered, left, distant, constellation, sagittarius, 18th, charles, included, catalog, cluster, largest, triplet, third, prominent, emission, region, includes, divided, lane, known, trifid, moniker"
A Light and Dusty Night,"Posing as a brilliant evening star, Venus lies near the western horizon in this southern hemisphere, early spring, night skyscape. To create the composite view exposures tracking the sky and fixed for the foreground were taken on September 25 from Cascavel in southern Brazil. In view after sunset, Venus appears immersed in a cone of zodiacal light, sunlight scattered from dust along the Solar System's ecliptic plane. In fact from either hemisphere of planet Earth, zodiacal light is most visible after sunset near a spring equinox, (or before sunrise near an autumn equinox) when its luminous arc lies at steep angles to the horizon. Extending above the sunset on this night, the zodiacal light reaches toward rich starfields and immense interstellar dust clouds in the bulge of the central Milky Way. Follow along the Milky Way from the central bulge back toward the horizon and you'll spot the closest star system to the Sun, Alpha Centauri, a mere 4.37 light-years away.","light, dusty, night, posing, brilliant, evening, star, venus, western, horizon, southern, early, spring, skyscape, create, composite, view, exposure, tracking, fixed, foreground, taken, cascavel, brazil, sunset, appears, immersed, cone, zodiacal, sunlight, scattered, dust, solar, system, ecliptic, plane, fact, hemisphere, planet, earth, visible, equinox, sunrise, autumn, luminous, steep, angle, extending, reach, rich, starfields, immense, interstellar, cloud, bulge, central, milky, follow, spot, closest, alpha, centauri, light-year"
The Holographic Principle and a Teapot,"Sure, you can see the 2D rectangle of colors, but can you see deeper?  Counting color patches in the featured image, you might estimate that the most information that this 2D digital image can hold is about 60 (horizontal) x 50(vertical) x 256 (possible colors) = 768,000 bits.  However, the yet-unproven Holographic Principle states that,  counter-intuitively, the information in a 2D panel can include all of the information in a 3D room that can be enclosed by the panel.  The principle derives from the idea that the Planck length, the length scale where quantum mechanics begins to dominate classical gravity, is one side of an area that can hold only about one bit of information.  The limit was first postulated by physicist Gerard 't Hooft in 1993.  It can arise from generalizations from seemingly distant speculation that the information held by a black hole is determined not by its enclosed volume but by the surface area of its event horizon.  The term ""holographic"" arises from a hologram analogy where three-dimension images are created by projecting light through a flat screen.  Beware, some people staring at the featured image may not think it encodes just 768,000 bits -- nor even 2563,000 bit permutations -- rather they might claim it  encodes a three-dimensional teapot.","holographic, principle, teapot, sure, rectangle, color, deeper, counting, patch, featured, image, estimate, information, digital, hold, horizontal, vertical, possible, yet-unproven, state, counter-intuitively, panel, include, room, enclosed, derives, idea, planck, length, scale, quantum, mechanic, begin, dominate, classical, gravity, side, area, limit, postulated, physicist, gerard, hooft, arise, generalization, distant, speculation, held, black, hole, determined, volume, surface, event, horizon, term, arises, hologram, analogy, three-dimension, created, projecting, light, flat, screen, beware, people, staring, think, encodes, permutation, claim, three-dimensional"
NGC 4676: When Mice Collide,"These two mighty galaxies are pulling each other apart.  Known as the ""Mice"" because they have such long tails, each spiral galaxy has likely already passed through the other. The long tails are created by the relative difference between gravitational pulls on the near and far parts of each galaxy.  Because the distances are so large, the cosmic interaction takes place in slow motion -- over hundreds of millions of years.  NGC 4676 lies about 300 million light-years away toward the constellation of Bernice's Hair (Coma Berenices) and are  likely members of the Coma Cluster of Galaxies.  The featured picture was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope's Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2002. These galactic mice will probably collide again and again over the next billion years so that, instead of continuing to pull each other apart, they coalesce to form a single galaxy.

Sunrise at the South Pole,"Sunrise at the South Pole is different. Usually a welcome sight, it follows months of darkness -- and begins months of sunshine. At Earth's poles, it can take weeks for the Sun to rise, in contrast with hours at any mid-latitude location.  Sunrise at a pole is caused by the tilt of the Earth as it orbits the Sun, not by the rotation of the Earth.  Although at a pole, an airless Earth would first see first Sun at an equinox, the lensing effect of the Earth's atmosphere and the size of the solar disk causes the top of the Sun to appear about two-weeks early.  Pictured two weeks ago, the Sun peeks above the horizon of a vast frozen landscape at Earth's South Pole.  The true South Pole is just a few meters to the left of the communications tower. This polar sunrise capture was particularly photogenic as the Sun appeared capped by a green flash.","sunrise, south, pole, different, welcome, sight, follows, month, darkness, begin, sunshine, earth, take, week, rise, contrast, hour, mid-latitude, location, caused, tilt, orbit, rotation, airless, first, equinox, lensing, effect, atmosphere, size, solar, disk, cause, appear, two-weeks, early, pictured, peek, horizon, vast, frozen, landscape, true, meter, left, communication, tower, polar, capture, photogenic, appeared, capped, green, flash"
M43: Streams of Orion,"Where do the dark streams of dust in the Orion Nebula originate? This part of the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex, M43, is the often imaged but rarely mentioned neighbor of the more famous M42. M42, seen in part to the upper right, includes many bright stars from the Trapezium star cluster. M43 is itself a star forming region that displays intricately-laced streams of dark dust -- although it is really composed mostly of glowing hydrogen gas. The entire Orion field is located about 1600 light years away.  Opaque to visible light, the picturesque dark dust is created in the outer atmosphere of massive cool stars and expelled by strong outer winds of protons and electrons.","stream, orion, dark, dust, nebula, originate, part, molecular, cloud, complex, imaged, mentioned, famous, seen, upper, right, includes, many, bright, star, trapezium, cluster, forming, region, display, intricately-laced, composed, glowing, hydrogen, entire, field, located, light, year, opaque, visible, picturesque, created, outer, massive, cool, expelled, strong, proton, electron"
NGC 6559: East of the Lagoon,"Slide your telescope just east of the Lagoon Nebula to find this alluring field of view in the rich starfields of the constellation Sagittarius toward the central Milky Way. Of course the Lagoon nebula is also known as M8, the eighth object listed in Charles Messier's famous catalog of bright nebulae and star clusters. Close on the sky but slightly fainter than M8, this complex of nebulae was left out of Messier's list though. It contains obscuring dust, striking red emission and blue reflection nebulae of star-forming region NGC 6559 at right. Like M8, NGC 6559 is located about 5,000 light-years away along the edge of a large molecular cloud. At that distance, this telescopic frame nearly 3 full moons wide would span about 130 light-years.

The Double Cluster in Perseus,"This pretty starfield spans about three full moons (1.5 degrees) across the heroic northern constellation of Perseus. It holds the famous pair of open star clusters, h and Chi Persei. Also cataloged as NGC 869 (top) and NGC 884, both clusters are about 7,000 light-years away and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  Separated by only a few hundred light-years, the clusters are both 13 million years young based on the ages of their individual stars, evidence that they were likely a product of the same star-forming region. Always a rewarding sight in binoculars, the Double Cluster is even visible to the unaided eye from dark locations.

50 Light-years to 51 Pegasi,"It's only 50 light-years to 51 Pegasi. That star's position is indicated in this snapshot from August, taken on a hazy night with mostly brighter stars visible above the dome at Observatoire de Haute-Provence in France. Twenty-six years ago, in October of 1995, astronomers Michel Mayor and Didier Queloz announced a profound discovery made at the observatory. Using a precise spectrograph they had detected a planet orbiting 51 Peg, the first known exoplanet orbiting a sun-like star. Mayor and Queloz had used the spectrograph to measure changes in the star's radial velocity, a regular wobble caused by the gravitational tug of the orbiting planet. Designated 51 Pegasi b, the planet was determined to have a mass at least half of Jupiter's mass and an orbital period of 4.2 days, making it much closer to its parent star than Mercury is to the Sun. Their discovery was quickly confirmed and Mayor and Queloz were ultimately awarded the Nobel Prize in physics in 2019. Now recognized as the prototype for the class of exoplanets fondly known as hot Jupiters, 51 Pegasi b was formally named Dimidium, latin for half, in 2015. Since its discovery, over 4,000 exoplanets have been found.","light-year, pegasi, star, position, indicated, snapshot, taken, hazy, night, visible, dome, observatoire, haute-provence, france, year, astronomer, michel, mayor, didier, queloz, announced, profound, discovery, made, observatory, using, precise, spectrograph, detected, planet, orbiting, known, exoplanet, sun-like, used, measure, change, radial, velocity, regular, wobble, caused, gravitational, designated, determined, mass, least, half, jupiter, orbital, period, making, much, parent, mercury, confirmed, awarded, nobel, prize, physic, recognized, prototype, class, exoplanets, named, dimidium, latin, found"
Full Moon Silhouettes,"Have you ever watched the Moon rise? The slow rise of a nearly full moon over a clear horizon can be an impressive sight. One impressive moonrise was imaged in early 2013 over Mount Victoria Lookout in Wellington, New Zealand. With detailed planning, an industrious astrophotographer placed a camera about two kilometers away and pointed it across the lookout to where the Moon would surely soon be making its nightly debut. The featured single shot sequence is unedited and shown in real time -- it is not a time lapse. People on Mount Victoria Lookout can be seen in silhouette themselves admiring the dawn of Earth's largest satellite. Seeing a moonrise yourself is not difficult: it happens every day, although only half the time at night. Each day the Moon rises about fifty minutes later than the previous day, with a full moon always rising at sunset.  This Saturday, October 16, is International Observe the Moon Night, where you observe a first-quarter Moon along with other lunar enthusiasts.","full, moon, silhouette, watched, rise, slow, clear, horizon, impressive, sight, moonrise, imaged, early, mount, victoria, wellington, zealand, detailed, planning, industrious, astrophotographer, placed, camera, kilometer, pointed, lookout, making, debut, featured, single, shot, sequence, unedited, shown, real, time, lapse, people, seen, admiring, dawn, earth, largest, satellite, seeing, difficult, happens, half, night, fifty, minute, previous, rising, sunset, saturday, international, observe, first-quarter, lunar, enthusiast"
Juno Flyby of Ganymede and Jupiter,"What would it be like to fly over the largest moon in the Solar System? In June, the robotic Juno spacecraft flew past Jupiter's huge moon Ganymede and took images that have been digitally constructed into a detailed flyby. As the featured video begins, Juno swoops over the two-toned surface of the 2,000-km wide moon, revealing an icy alien landscape filled with grooves and craters. The grooves are likely caused by shifting surface plates, while the craters are caused by violent impacts. Continuing on in its orbit, Juno then performed its 34th close pass over Jupiter's clouds. The digitally-constructed video shows numerous swirling clouds in the north, colorful planet-circling zones and bands across the middle -- featuring several white-oval clouds from the String of Pearls, and finally more swirling clouds in the south.  Next September, Juno is scheduled to make a close pass over another of Jupiter's large moons: Europa.","juno, flyby, ganymede, jupiter, like, largest, moon, solar, system, june, robotic, spacecraft, flew, huge, took, image, constructed, detailed, featured, video, begin, swoop, two-toned, surface, 2,000-km, wide, revealing, alien, landscape, filled, groove, crater, caused, shifting, plate, violent, impact, continuing, orbit, performed, close, cloud, digitally-constructed, show, numerous, swirling, north, colorful, planet-circling, zone, band, middle, featuring, several, white-oval, string, pearl, south, next, september, scheduled, make, large, europa"
Fireball over Lake Louise,"What makes a meteor a fireball?  First of all, everyone agrees that a fireball is an exceptionally bright meteor. Past that, the International Astronomical Union defines a fireball as a meteor brighter than apparent magnitude -4, which corresponds (roughly) to being brighter than any planet -- as well as bright enough to cast a human-noticeable shadow.  Pictured, an astrophotographer taking a long-duration sky image captured by accident the brightest meteor he had ever seen.  Clearly a fireball, the disintegrating space-rock created a trail so bright it turned night into day for about two seconds earlier this month.  The fireball has been artificially dimmed in the featured image to bring up foreground Lake Louise in Alberta, Canada.  Although fireballs are rare, many people have been lucky enough to see them.  If you see a fireball, you can report it.  If more than one person recorded an image, the fireball might be traceable back to the Solar System body from which it was ejected.","fireball, lake, louise, make, meteor, everyone, agrees, bright, international, astronomical, union, defines, brighter, apparent, magnitude, corresponds, planet, enough, cast, human-noticeable, shadow, pictured, taking, long-duration, image, captured, accident, brightest, seen, disintegrating, space-rock, created, trail, turned, night, second, month, dimmed, featured, bring, foreground, canada, rare, many, people, lucky, report, person, recorded, traceable, solar, system, body, ejected"
NGC 7822: Cosmic Question Mark,"It may look like a huge cosmic question mark, but the big question really is  how does the bright gas and dark dust tell this nebula's history of star formation.  At the edge of a giant molecular cloud toward the northern constellation Cepheus, the glowing star forming region NGC 7822 lies about 3,000 light-years away. Within the nebula, bright edges and dark shapes stand out in this colorful and detailed skyscape. The 9-panel mosaic, taken over 28 nights with a small telescope in Texas, includes data from narrowband filters, mapping emission from atomic oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur into blue, green, and red hues. The emission line and color combination has become well-known as the Hubble palette. The atomic emission is powered by energetic radiation from the central hot stars. Their powerful winds and radiation sculpt and erode the denser pillar shapes and clear out a characteristic cavity light-years across the center of the natal cloud. Stars could still be forming inside the pillars by gravitational collapse but as the pillars are eroded away, any forming stars will ultimately be cut off from their reservoir of star stuff. This field of view spans over 40 light-years across at the estimated distance of NGC 7822.","cosmic, question, mark, look, huge, bright, dark, dust, tell, nebula, history, star, formation, edge, giant, molecular, cloud, northern, constellation, cepheus, glowing, forming, region, light-year, shape, stand, colorful, detailed, skyscape, mosaic, taken, night, small, telescope, texas, includes, data, mapping, emission, atomic, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, blue, green, line, color, combination, become, well-known, hubble, palette, powered, energetic, radiation, central, powerful, wind, sculpt, erode, denser, pillar, clear, characteristic, cavity, center, natal, gravitational, collapse, eroded, reservoir, stuff, field, view, span, estimated, distance"
NGC 7293: The Helix Nebula,"A mere seven hundred light years from Earth, toward the constellation Aquarius, a sun-like star is dying. Its last few thousand years have produced the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), a well studied and nearby example of a Planetary Nebula, typical of this final phase of stellar evolution.  A total of 90 hours of exposure time have gone in to creating this expansive view of the nebula. Combining narrow band image data from emission lines of hydrogen atoms in red and oxygen atoms in blue-green hues, it shows remarkable details of the Helix's brighter inner region about 3 light-years across. The white dot at the Helix's center is this Planetary Nebula's hot, central star.

The Moona Lisa,"Only natural colors of the Moon in planet Earth's sky appear in this creative visual presentation. Arranged as pixels in a framed image, the lunar disks were photographed at different times. Their varying hues are ultimately due to reflected sunlight affected by changing atmospheric conditions and the alignment geometry of Moon, Earth, and Sun. Here, the darkest lunar disks are the colors of earthshine. A description of earthshine, in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface, was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci.  But stand farther back from your monitor or just shift your gaze to the smaller versions of the image. You might also see one of da Vinci's most famous works of art.

The Einstein Cross Gravitational Lens,"Most galaxies have a single nucleus -- does this galaxy have four?  The strange answer leads astronomers to conclude that the nucleus of the surrounding galaxy is not even visible in this image.  The central cloverleaf is rather light emitted from a background quasar.  The gravitational field of the visible foreground galaxy breaks light from this distant quasar into four distinct images.  The quasar must be properly aligned behind the center of a massive galaxy for a mirage like this to be evident.  The general effect is known as gravitational lensing, and this specific case is known as the Einstein Cross.  Stranger still, the images of the Einstein Cross vary in relative brightness, enhanced occasionally by the additional gravitational microlensing effect of specific stars in the foreground galaxy.","cross, gravitational, lens, galaxy, single, nucleus, strange, lead, astronomer, conclude, surrounding, visible, image, central, cloverleaf, light, emitted, background, quasar, field, foreground, break, distant, distinct, aligned, center, massive, mirage, evident, general, effect, known, lensing, specific, case, stranger, einstein, vary, relative, brightness, enhanced, additional, microlensing, star"
Earthshine Moon over Sicily,"Why can we see the entire face of this Moon?  When the Moon is in a crescent phase, only part of it appears directly illuminated by the Sun.  The answer is earthshine, also known as earthlight and the da Vinci glow.  The reason is that the rest of the Earth-facing Moon is slightly illuminated by sunlight first reflected from the Earth.  Since the Earth appears near full phase from the Moon -- when the Moon appears as a slight crescent from the Earth -- earthshine is then near its brightest.  Featured here in combined, consecutively-taken, HDR images taken earlier this month, a rising earthshine Moon was captured passing slowly near the planet Venus, the brightest spot near the image center.  Just above Venus is the star Dschubba (catalogued as Delta Scorpii), while the red star on the far left is Antares. The celestial show is visible through scenic cloud decks.

Palomar 6: Globular Star Cluster,"Where did this big ball of stars come from? Palomar 6 is one of about 200 globular clusters of stars that survive in our Milky Way Galaxy. These spherical star-balls are older than our Sun as well as older than most stars that orbit in our galaxy's disk.  Palomar 6 itself is estimated to be about 12.5 billion years old, so old that it is close to -- and so constrains -- the age of the entire universe.  Containing about 500,000 stars, Palomar 6 lies about 25,000 light years away, but not very far from our galaxy's center.  At that distance, this sharp image from the Hubble Space Telescope spans about 15 light-years.  After much study including images from Hubble, a leading origin hypothesis is that Palomar 6 was created -- and survives today -- in the central bulge of stars that surround the Milky Way's center, not in the distant galactic halo where most other globular clusters are now found.","palomar, globular, star, cluster, ball, come, survive, milky, galaxy, spherical, star-balls, older, orbit, disk, estimated, year, close, constrains, entire, universe, containing, light, center, distance, sharp, image, hubble, space, telescope, span, light-year, much, study, including, leading, origin, hypothesis, created, survives, today, central, bulge, surround, distant, galactic, halo, found"
Lucy Launches to Eight Asteroids,"Why would this mission go out as far as Jupiter -- but then not visit Jupiter? Lucy's plan is to follow different leads about the origin of our Solar System than can be found at Jupiter -- where Juno now orbits. Jupiter is such a massive planet that its gravity captures numerous asteroids that orbit the Sun ahead of it -- and behind. These trojan asteroids formed all over our Solar System and some may have been trapped there for billions of years. Flying by these trojan asteroids enables studying them as fossils that likely hold unique clues about our early Solar System. Lucy, named after a famous fossil skeleton which was named after a famous song, is scheduled to visit eight asteroids from 2025 to 2033.  Pictured, Lucy's launch was captured with reflection last week aboard a powerful Atlas V rocket from Cape Canaveral, Florida, USA.","lucy, launch, asteroid, mission, jupiter, visit, plan, follow, different, lead, origin, solar, system, found, juno, orbit, massive, planet, gravity, capture, numerous, trojan, formed, trapped, year, flying, enables, studying, fossil, likely, hold, unique, clue, early, named, famous, skeleton, song, scheduled, pictured, captured, reflection, last, week, powerful, atlas, rocket, cape, canaveral, florida"
SH2-308: The Dolphin-head Nebula,"Blown by fast winds from a hot, massive star, this cosmic bubble is huge. Cataloged as Sharpless 2-308 it lies some 5,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major) and covers slightly more of the sky than a Full Moon. That corresponds to a diameter of 60 light-years at its estimated distance. The massive star that created the bubble, a Wolf-Rayet star, is the bright one near the center of the nebula. Wolf-Rayet stars have over 20 times the mass of the Sun and are thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova phase of massive star evolution. Fast winds from this Wolf-Rayet star create the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution. The windblown nebula has an age of about 70,000 years. Relatively faint emission captured by narrowband filters in the deep image is dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atoms mapped to a blue hue.

Above and right of center in the frame you can spot the faint fuzzy reddish appearance of Messier 1 (M1), also known as the Crab Nebula. M1 is the first object in 18th century comet hunter Charles Messier's famous catalog of things which are definitely not comets. Made from image data captured this October 11, there is a comet in the picture though. Below center and left lies the faint greenish coma and dusty tail of periodic comet 67P Churyumov-Gerasimenko, also known as Rosetta's comet. In the 21st century, it became the final resting place of robots from planet Earth. Rosetta's comet is now returning to the inner solar system, sweeping toward its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun, on November 2. Too faint to be seen by eye alone, the comet's next perigee or closest approach to Earth will be November 12.","comet, crab, pretty, field, view, span, degree, full, moon, filled, star, constellation, taurus, bull, center, frame, spot, faint, fuzzy, reddish, appearance, messier, known, nebula, object, 18th, century, hunter, charles, famous, catalog, thing, made, image, data, captured, picture, left, greenish, coma, dusty, tail, periodic, churyumov-gerasimenko, rosetta, 21st, became, final, resting, place, robot, planet, earth, returning, inner, solar, system, sweeping, next, perihelion, closest, approach, november, seen, perigee"
3D Bennu,"Put on your red/blue glasses and float next to asteroid 101955 Bennu. Shaped like a spinning toy top with boulders littering its rough surface, the tiny Solar System world is about one Empire State Building (less than 500 meters) across. Frames used to construct this 3D anaglyph were taken by PolyCam on the OSIRIS_REx spacecraft on December 3, 2018 from a distance of about 80 kilometers. With a sample from the asteroid's rocky surface on board, OSIRIS_REx departed Bennu's vicinity this May and is now enroute to planet Earth.

Halloween and the Ghost Head Nebula,"Halloween's origin is ancient and astronomical.  Since the fifth century BC, Halloween has been celebrated as a cross-quarter day, a day halfway between an equinox (equal day / equal night) and a solstice (minimum day / maximum night in the northern hemisphere).  With a modern calendar however, even though Halloween occurs next week, the real cross-quarter day will occur the week after.  Another cross-quarter day is Groundhog Day. Halloween's modern celebration retains historic roots in dressing to scare away the spirits of the dead.  Perhaps a fitting tribute to this ancient holiday is this view of the Ghost Head Nebula taken with the Hubble Space Telescope.  Similar to the icon of a fictional ghost, NGC 2080 is actually a star forming region in the Large Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  The Ghost Head Nebula (NGC 2080) spans about 50 light-years and is shown in representative colors.","halloween, ghost, head, nebula, origin, ancient, astronomical, fifth, century, celebrated, cross-quarter, halfway, equinox, equal, night, solstice, minimum, maximum, modern, calendar, occurs, week, real, groundhog, celebration, retains, historic, root, dressing, scare, spirit, dead, fitting, tribute, holiday, view, taken, hubble, space, telescope, similar, icon, fictional, star, forming, region, large, magellanic, cloud, satellite, galaxy, milky, span, light-year, shown, representative, color"
Road to the Galactic Center,"Does the road to our galaxy's center go through Monument Valley? It doesn't have to, but if your road does -- take a picture. In this case, the road is US Route 163 and iconic buttes on the Navajo National Reservation populate the horizon.  The band of Milky Way Galaxy stretches down from the sky and appears to be a continuation of the road on Earth. Filaments of dust darken the Milky Way, in contrast to billions of bright stars and several colorful glowing gas clouds including the Lagoon and Trifid nebulas. The featured picture is a composite of images taken with the same camera and from the same location -- Forest Gump Point in Utah, USA.

Jupiter Rotates,"Observe the graceful twirl of our Solar System's largest planet. Many interesting features of Jupiter's enigmatic atmosphere, including dark belts and light zones, can be followed in detail. A careful inspection will reveal that different cloud layers rotate at slightly different speeds. The famous Great Red Spot is not visible at first -- but soon rotates into view. Other smaller storm systems occasionally appear. As large as Jupiter is, it rotates in only 10 hours. Our small Earth, by comparison, takes 24 hours to complete a spin cycle. The featured high-resolution time-lapse video was captured over five nights earlier this month by a mid-sized telescope on an apartment balcony in Paris, France.  Since hydrogen and helium gas are colorless, and those elements compose most of Jupiter's expansive atmosphere, what trace elements create the observed colors of Jupiter's clouds remains a topic of research.

NGC 6995: The Bat Nebula,"Do you see the bat?  It haunts this cosmic close-up of the eastern Veil Nebula.  The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant, the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star. While the Veil is roughly circular in shape and covers nearly 3 degrees on the sky toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus), NGC 6995, known informally as the Bat Nebula, spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size of the Moon. That translates to 12 light-years at the Veil's estimated distance, a reassuring 1,400 light-years from planet Earth. In the composite of image data recorded through narrow band filters, emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong emission from oxygen atoms shown in hues of blue.

Mirach's Ghost,"As far as ghosts go, Mirach's Ghost isn't really that scary. Mirach's Ghost is just a faint, fuzzy galaxy, well known to astronomers, that happens to be seen nearly along the line-of-sight to Mirach, a bright star. Centered in this star field, Mirach is also called Beta Andromedae. About 200 light-years distant, Mirach is a red giant star, cooler than the Sun but much larger and so intrinsically much brighter than our parent star. In most telescopic views, glare and diffraction spikes tend to hide things that lie near Mirach and make the faint, fuzzy galaxy look like a ghostly internal reflection of the almost overwhelming starlight. Still, appearing in this sharp image just above and to the right of Mirach, Mirach's Ghost is cataloged as galaxy NGC 404 and is estimated to be some 10 million light-years away.","mirach, ghost, scary, faint, fuzzy, galaxy, known, astronomer, happens, seen, line-of-sight, bright, star, centered, field, called, beta, andromedae, light-year, distant, giant, cooler, much, larger, brighter, parent, telescopic, view, glare, diffraction, tend, hide, thing, make, look, internal, reflection, overwhelming, starlight, appearing, sharp, image, cataloged, estimated"
Haunting the Cepheus Flare,"Spooky shapes seem to haunt this dusty expanse, drifting through the night in the royal constellation Cepheus. Of course, the shapes are cosmic dust clouds visible in dimly reflected starlight. Far from your own neighborhood, they lurk above the plane of the Milky Way at the edge of the Cepheus Flare molecular cloud complex some 1,200 light-years away. Over 2 light-years across and brighter than most of the other ghostly apparitions, vdB 141 or Sh2-136 is also known as the Ghost Nebula, seen at the right of the starry field of view. Inside the nebula are the telltale signs of dense cores collapsing in the early stages of star formation. With the eerie hue of dust reflecting bluish light from hot young stars of NGC 7023, the Iris Nebula stands out against the dark just left of center. In the broad telescopic frame, these fertile interstellar dust fields stretch almost seven full moons across the sky.","haunting, cepheus, flare, spooky, shape, seem, haunt, dusty, expanse, drifting, night, royal, constellation, course, cosmic, dust, cloud, visible, reflected, starlight, neighborhood, lurk, plane, milky, edge, molecular, complex, light-year, brighter, apparition, sh2-136, known, ghost, nebula, seen, right, starry, field, view, telltale, sign, dense, core, collapsing, early, stage, star, formation, reflecting, bluish, light, young, iris, stand, dark, left, center, broad, telescopic, frame, fertile, interstellar, stretch, full, moon"
A Rorschach Aurora,"If you see this as a monster's face, don't panic. It's only pareidolia, often experienced as the tendency to see faces in patterns of light and shadow. In fact, the startling visual scene is actually a 180 degree panorama of Northern Lights, digitally mirrored like inkblots on a folded piece of paper. Frames used to construct it were captured on a September night from the middle of a waterfall-crossing suspension bridge in Jamtland, Sweden. With geomagnetic storms triggered by recent solar activity, auroral displays could be very active at planet Earth's high latitudes in the coming days. But if you see a monster's face in your own neighborhood tomorrow night, it might just be Halloween.","rorschach, aurora, monster, face, panic, pareidolia, experienced, tendency, pattern, light, shadow, fact, startling, visual, scene, degree, panorama, northern, mirrored, inkblot, folded, piece, paper, frame, used, construct, captured, september, night, middle, waterfall-crossing, suspension, bridge, jamtland, sweden, geomagnetic, storm, triggered, recent, solar, activity, auroral, display, active, planet, earth, high, latitude, coming, neighborhood, tomorrow, halloween"
Dark Matter in a Simulated Universe,"Is our universe haunted?  It might look that way on this dark matter map.  The gravity of unseen dark matter is the leading explanation for why galaxies rotate so fast, why galaxies orbit clusters so fast, why gravitational lenses so strongly deflect light, and why visible matter is distributed as it is both in the local universe and on the cosmic microwave background.  The featured image from the American Museum of Natural History's Hayden Planetarium Space Show Dark Universe highlights one example of how pervasive dark matter might haunt our universe.  In this frame from a detailed computer simulation, complex filaments of dark matter, shown in black, are strewn about the universe like spider webs, while the relatively rare clumps of familiar baryonic matter are colored orange. These simulations are good statistical matches to astronomical observations.  In what is perhaps a scarier turn of events, dark matter -- although quite strange and in an unknown form -- is no longer thought to be the strangest source of gravity in the universe. That honor now falls to dark energy, a more uniform source of repulsive gravity that seems to now dominate the expansion of the entire universe.

A Waterfall and the Milky Way,"The dream was to capture both the waterfall and the Milky Way together. Difficulties included finding a good camera location, artificially illuminating the waterfall and the surrounding valley effectively, capturing the entire scene with numerous foreground and background shots, worrying that fireflies would be too distracting, keeping the camera dry, and avoiding stepping on a poisonous snake.  Behold the result -- captured after midnight in mid-July and digitally stitched into a wide-angle panorama. The waterfall is the picturesque Zhulian waterfall in the Luoxiao Mountains in eastern Hunan Province, China. The central band of our Milky Way Galaxy crosses the sky and shows numerous dark dust filaments and colorful nebulas. Bright stars dot the sky -- all residing in the nearby Milky Way -- including the Summer Triangle with bright Vega visible above the Milky Way's arch. After capturing all 78 component exposures for you to enjoy, the photographer and friends enjoyed the view themselves for the rest of the night.

SN Requiem: A Supernova Seen Three Times So Far,"We've seen this same supernova three times -- when will we see it a fourth?  When a distant star explodes in a supernova, we're lucky if we see it even once. In the case of AT 2016jka (""SN Requiem""), because the exploding star happened to be lined up behind the center of a galaxy cluster (MACS J0138 in this case), a comparison of Hubble Space Telescope images demonstrate that we saw it three times. These three supernova images are highlighted in circles near the bottom of the left frame taken in 2016. On the right frame, taken in 2019, the circles are empty because all three images of the single supernova had faded. Computer modeling of the cluster lens, however, indicates that a fourth image of the same supernova should eventually appear in the upper circle on the right image. But when? The best models predict this will happen in 2037, but this date is uncertain by about two years because of ambiguities in the mass distribution of the cluster lens and the brightness history of the stellar explosion. With refined predictions and vigilant monitoring, Earthlings living 16 years from now may be able to catch this fourth image -- and perhaps learn more about both galaxy clusters and supernovas at once.

The Horsehead and Flame Nebulas,"The Horsehead Nebula is one of the most famous nebulae on the sky.  It is visible as the dark indentation to the orange emission nebula at the far right of the featured picture.  The horse-head feature is dark because it is really an opaque dust cloud that lies in front of the bright emission nebula. Like clouds in Earth's atmosphere, this cosmic cloud has assumed a recognizable shape by chance.  After many thousands of years, the internal motions of the cloud will surely alter its appearance.  The emission nebula's orange color is caused by electrons recombining with protons to form hydrogen atoms.  Toward the lower left of the image is the Flame Nebula, an orange-tinged nebula that also contains intricate filaments of dark dust. Two prominent reflection nebulas are visible: round IC 432 on the far left, and blue NGC 2023 just to the lower left of the Horsehead nebula.  Each glows primarily by reflecting the light of their central star.

NGC 147 and NGC 185,"Dwarf galaxies NGC 147 (left) and NGC 185 stand side by side in this sharp telescopic portrait. The two are not-often-imaged satellites of M31, the great spiral Andromeda Galaxy, some 2.5 million light-years away. Their separation on the sky, less than one degree across a pretty field of view, translates to only about 35 thousand light-years at Andromeda's distance, but Andromeda itself is found well outside this frame. Brighter and more famous satellite galaxies of Andromeda, M32 and M110, are seen closer to the great spiral. NGC 147 and NGC 185 have been identified as binary galaxies, forming a gravitationally stable binary system. But recently discovered faint dwarf galaxy Cassiopeia II also seems to be part of their system, forming a gravitationally bound group within Andromeda's intriguing population of small satellite galaxies.","dwarf, galaxy, left, stand, side, sharp, telescopic, portrait, not-often-imaged, satellite, great, spiral, andromeda, light-year, separation, degree, pretty, field, view, translates, distance, found, outside, frame, famous, m110, seen, identified, binary, forming, stable, system, discovered, faint, cassiopeia, seems, part, bound, group, intriguing, population, small"
The Dark Seahorse in Cepheus,"Light-years across, this suggestive shape known as the Seahorse Nebula appears in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars. Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, obscuring clouds are part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within, but their collapsing cores are only visible at long infrared wavelengths.

The Galaxy Between Two Friends,"On an August night two friends enjoyed this view after a day's hike on the Plateau d'Emparis in the French Alps. At 2400 meters altitude the sky was clear. Light from a setting moon illuminates the foreground captured in the simple vertical panorama of images. Along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy stars of Cassiopeia and Perseus shine along the panorama's left edge. But seen as a faint cloud with a brighter core, the Andromeda galaxy, stands directly above the two friends in the night. The nearest large spiral galaxy, Andromeda is about 2.5 million light-years beyond the stars of the Milky Way. Adding to the evening's shared extragalactic perspective, the fainter fuzzy spot in the sky right between them is M33, also known as the Triangulum galaxy. Third largest in the local galaxy group, after Andromeda and Milky Way, the Triangulum galaxy is about 3 million light-years distant.

The Cat's Eye Nebula in Optical and X-ray,"To some it looks like a cat's eye. To others, perhaps like a giant cosmic conch shell.  It is actually one of brightest and most highly detailed planetary nebula known, composed of gas expelled in the brief yet glorious phase near the end of life of a Sun-like star. This nebula's dying central star may have produced the outer circular concentric shells by shrugging off outer layers in a series of regular convulsions. The formation of the beautiful, complex-yet-symmetric inner structures, however, is not well understood. The featured image is a composite of a digitally sharpened Hubble Space Telescope image with X-ray light captured by the orbiting Chandra Observatory.  The exquisite floating space statue spans over half a light-year across. Of course, gazing into this Cat's Eye, humanity may well be seeing the fate of our sun, destined to enter its own planetary nebula phase of evolution ... in about 5 billion years.

A Filament Leaps from the Sun,"Why, sometimes, does part of the Sun's atmosphere leap into space? The reason lies in changing magnetic fields that thread through the Sun's surface.  Regions of strong surface magnetism, known as active regions, are usually marked by dark sunspots.  Active regions can channel charged gas along arching or sweeping magnetic fields -- gas that sometimes falls back, sometimes escapes, and sometimes not only escapes but impacts our Earth.  The featured one-hour time-lapse video -- taken with a small telescope in France -- captured an eruptive filament that appeared to leap off the Sun late last month. The filament is huge: for comparison, the size of the Earth is shown on the upper left. Just after the filament lifted off, the Sun emitted a powerful X-class flare while the surface rumbled with a tremendous solar tsunami. A result was a cloud of charged particles that rushed into our Solar System but mostly missed our Earth -- this time. However, enough solar plasma did impact our Earth's magnetosphere to create a few faint auroras.","filament, leap, part, atmosphere, space, reason, changing, magnetic, field, thread, surface, region, strong, magnetism, known, active, marked, dark, sunspot, channel, charged, arching, sweeping, fall, escape, impact, earth, featured, one-hour, time-lapse, video, taken, small, telescope, france, captured, eruptive, appeared, last, month, huge, comparison, size, shown, upper, left, lifted, emitted, powerful, x-class, flare, rumbled, tremendous, solar, tsunami, result, cloud, particle, rushed, system, missed, time, plasma, magnetosphere, create, faint, aurora"
All of These Space Images are Fake Except One,"Why would you want to fake a universe? For one reason -- to better understand our real universe. Many astronomical projects seeking to learn properties of our universe now start with a robotic telescope taking sequential images of the night sky. Next, sophisticated computer algorithms crunch these digital images to find stars and galaxies and measure their properties.  To calibrate these algorithms, it is useful to test them on fake images from a fake universe to see if the algorithms can correctly deduce purposely imprinted properties. The featured mosaic of fake images was created to specifically mimic the images that have appeared on NASA's Astronomy Picture of the Day (APOD).  Only one image of the 225 images is real -- can you find it? The accomplished deceptors have made available individual fake APOD images that can be displayed by accessing their ThisIsNotAnAPOD webpage or Twitter feed.

Video of a Green Flash,"Many think it is just a myth.  Others think it is true but its cause isn't known.  Adventurers pride themselves on having seen it.  It's a green flash from the Sun.  The truth is the green flash does exist and its cause is well understood.  Just as the setting Sun disappears completely from view, a last glimmer appears startlingly green.  The effect is typically visible only from locations with a low, distant horizon, and lasts just a few seconds. A green flash is also visible for a rising Sun, but takes better timing to spot.  A dramatic green flash was caught on video last month as the Sun set beyond the Ligurian Sea from Tuscany, Italy. The second sequence in the featured video shows the green flash in real time, while the first is sped up and the last is in slow motion. The Sun itself does not turn partly green -- the effect is caused by layers of the Earth's atmosphere acting like a prism.

NGC 1333: Stellar Nursery in Perseus,"NGC 1333 is seen in visible light as a reflection nebula, dominated by bluish hues characteristic of starlight reflected by interstellar dust. A mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation Perseus, it lies at the edge of a large, star-forming molecular cloud. This telescopic close-up spans about two full moons on the sky or just over 15 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 1333. It shows details of the dusty region along with telltale hints of contrasty red emission from Herbig-Haro objects, jets and shocked glowing gas emanating from recently formed stars. In fact, NGC 1333 contains hundreds of stars less than a million years old, most still hidden from optical telescopes by the pervasive stardust. The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago.","stellar, nursery, perseus, seen, visible, light, reflection, nebula, dominated, bluish, characteristic, starlight, reflected, interstellar, dust, light-year, distant, heroic, constellation, edge, large, star-forming, molecular, cloud, telescopic, close-up, span, full, moon, estimated, distance, show, detail, dusty, region, telltale, hint, contrasty, emission, herbig-haro, object, shocked, glowing, emanating, formed, star, fact, contains, hundred, year, hidden, optical, telescope, pervasive, stardust, chaotic, environment, similar"
M33: The Triangulum Galaxy,"The small, northern constellation Triangulum harbors this magnificent face-on spiral galaxy, M33. Its popular names include the Pinwheel Galaxy or just the Triangulum Galaxy. M33 is over 50,000 light-years in diameter, third largest in the Local Group of galaxies after the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), and our own Milky Way. About 3 million light-years from the Milky Way, M33 is itself thought to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy and astronomers in these two galaxies would likely have spectacular views of each other's grand spiral star systems. As for the view from planet Earth, this sharp image shows off M33's blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along the galaxy's loosely wound spiral arms. In fact, the cavernous NGC 604 is the brightest star forming region, seen here at about the 4 o'clock position from the galaxy center.

Rosetta's Comet in Gemini,"Returning along its 6.4 year orbit, periodic comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (67P) is caught in this telescopic frame from November 7. Sweeping past background stars in the constellation Gemini the comet's dusty tail stretches toward the upper right to Upsilon Geminorum. Also known as Pollux, Beta Geminorum, Gemini's brightest star, shines just off the upper left edge of the field-of-view. Churyumov-Gerasimenko reached its 2021 perihelion or closest approach to the Sun on November 2. At perigee, its closest approach to planet Earth on November 12, this comet was about 0.42 astronomical units away, though it remains too faint to be seen by eye alone. The well-studied comet was explored by robots from planet Earth during its last trip through the inner solar system. It's now famous as the final resting place for the historic Rosetta spacecraft and Philae lander.","rosetta, comet, gemini, returning, year, orbit, periodic, churyumov-gerasimenko, caught, telescopic, frame, sweeping, past, background, star, constellation, dusty, tail, stretch, upper, right, upsilon, geminorum, known, pollux, beta, brightest, shine, left, edge, field-of-view, reached, perihelion, closest, approach, november, perigee, planet, earth, astronomical, unit, remains, faint, seen, well-studied, explored, robot, last, trip, inner, solar, system, famous, final, resting, place, historic, spacecraft, philae, lander"
How to Identify that Light in the Sky,"What is that light in the sky? Perhaps one of humanity's more common questions, an answer may result from a few quick observations.  For example -- is it moving or blinking? If so, and if you live near a city, the answer is typically an airplane, since planes are so numerous and so few stars and satellites are bright enough to be seen over the din of artificial city lights. If not, and if you live far from a city, that bright light is likely a planet such as Venus or Mars -- the former of which is constrained to appear near the horizon just before dawn or after dusk.  Sometimes the low apparent motion of a distant airplane near the horizon makes it hard to tell from a bright planet, but even this can usually be discerned by the plane's motion over a few minutes. Still unsure?   The featured chart gives a sometimes-humorous but mostly-accurate assessment.  Dedicated sky enthusiasts will likely note -- and are encouraged to provide -- polite corrections.

Light Pillar over Volcanic Etna,"What happening above that volcano? Something very unusual -- a volcanic light pillar. More typically, light pillars are caused by sunlight and so appear as a bright column that extends upward above a rising or setting Sun. Alternatively, other light pillars -- some quite colorful -- have been recorded above street and house lights. This light pillar, though, was illuminated by the red light emitted by the glowing magma of an erupting volcano. The volcano is Italy's Mount Etna, and the featured image was captured with a single shot a few hours after sunset in mid-June. Freezing temperatures above the volcano's ash cloud created ice-crystals either in cirrus clouds high above the volcano -- or in condensed water vapor expelled by Mount Etna. These ice crystals -- mostly flat toward the ground but fluttering -- then reflected away light from the volcano's caldera.

Geminids from Gemini,"Where are all of these meteors coming from?  In terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the constellation of Gemini.  That is why the major meteor shower in December is known as the Geminids -- because shower meteors all appear to come from a radiant toward Gemini. Three dimensionally, however, sand-sized debris expelled from the unusual asteroid 3200 Phaethon follows a well-defined orbit about our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches Earth is superposed in front of the constellation of Gemini. Therefore, when Earth crosses this orbit, the radiant point of falling debris appears in Gemini.  Featured here, a composite of many images taken during the 2020 Geminids meteor shower shows over 200 bright meteors that streaked through the sky during the night December 14.  The best meteor shower in November, the Leonids, peaks tonight and tomorrow. Unfortunately, this year, dim meteors during the early-morning peak will be hard to see against a sky lit by a bright gibbous moon.  Still, a few bright Leonid meteors should be visible each hour.","geminids, gemini, meteor, coming, term, direction, pointed, answer, constellation, major, shower, december, known, appear, come, radiant, sand-sized, debris, expelled, unusual, asteroid, phaethon, follows, well-defined, orbit, part, approach, earth, superposed, front, cross, point, falling, appears, featured, composite, many, image, taken, show, bright, streaked, night, best, november, leonids, peak, tonight, tomorrow, year, early-morning, hard, gibbous, moon, leonid, visible, hour"
NGC 3314: When Galaxies Overlap,"Why doesn't the nearby galaxy create a gravitational lensing effect on the background galaxy? It does, but since both galaxies are so nearby, the angular shift is much smaller than the angular sizes of the galaxies themselves.  The featured Hubble image of NGC 3314 shows two large spiral galaxies which happen to line up exactly.  The foreground spiral NGC 3314a appears nearly face-on with its pinwheel shape defined by young bright star clusters.  Against the glow of the background galaxy NGC 3314b, though, dark swirling lanes of interstellar dust can also be seen tracing the nearer spiral's structure.  Both galaxies appear on the edge of the Hydra Cluster of Galaxies, a cluster that is about 200 million light years away. Gravitational lens distortions are much easier to see when the lensing galaxy is smaller and further away. Then, the background galaxy may even be distorted into a ring around the nearer. Fast gravitational lens flashes due to stars in the foreground galaxy momentarily magnifying the light from stars in the background galaxy might one day be visible in future observing campaigns with high-resolution telescopes.","galaxy, overlap, create, gravitational, lensing, effect, background, angular, shift, smaller, size, featured, hubble, image, show, large, spiral, happen, line, foreground, appears, face-on, pinwheel, shape, defined, young, bright, star, cluster, glow, dark, swirling, lane, interstellar, dust, seen, tracing, nearer, structure, appear, edge, hydra, light, year, lens, distortion, easier, distorted, ring, fast, flash, magnifying, visible, future, observing, campaign, high-resolution, telescope"
Full Moonlight,"A photographer in silhouette stands in bright moonlight as the Full Moon rises in this well-planned telephoto image. Of course, the Full Moon is normally the brightest lunar phase. But on November 18/19, the Full Moon's light will be dimmed during a deep partial lunar eclipse seen across much of planet Earth. At maximum eclipse only a few percent of the lunar disk's diameter should remain outside the Earth's dark umbral shadow when the Moon slides close to the shadow's southern edge. Near apogee, the farthest point in its orbit, the Moon's motion will be slow. That should make this second lunar eclipse of 2021 an exceptionally long partial lunar eclipse. For most of North America the eclipse partial phases will be visible in predawn hours. Since eclipses tend to come in pairs, this lunar eclipse will be followed by a solar eclipse in two weeks on December 4.","full, moonlight, photographer, silhouette, stand, bright, moon, rise, well-planned, telephoto, image, course, brightest, lunar, phase, light, dimmed, deep, partial, eclipse, seen, much, planet, earth, maximum, percent, disk, diameter, remain, dark, umbral, shadow, slide, close, southern, edge, apogee, farthest, point, orbit, motion, slow, make, second, north, america, visible, predawn, hour, tend, come, pair, followed, solar, week, december"
NGC 281: Starless with Stars,"In visible light the stars have been removed from this narrow-band image of NGC 281, a star forming region some 10,000 light-years away toward the constellation Cassiopeia. Stars were digitally added back to the resulting starless image though. But instead of using visible light image data, the stars were added with X-ray data (in purple) from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and infrared data (in red) from the Spitzer Space Telescope. The merged multiwavelength view reveals a multitude of stars in the region's embedded star cluster IC 1590. The young stars are normally hidden in visible light images by the natal cloud's gas and obscuring dust. Also known to backyard astro-imagers as the Pacman Nebula for its overall appearance in visible light, NGC 281 is about 80 light-years across.","starless, star, visible, light, removed, narrow-band, image, forming, region, light-year, constellation, cassiopeia, added, resulting, using, data, x-ray, purple, chandra, observatory, infrared, spitzer, space, telescope, merged, multiwavelength, view, reveals, multitude, embedded, cluster, young, hidden, natal, cloud, obscuring, dust, known, astro-imagers, pacman, overall, appearance"
An Almost Total Lunar Eclipse,"Predawn hours of November 19 found the Moon in partly cloudy skies over Cancun, Mexico. Captured in this telephoto snapshot, the lunar disk is not quite entirely immersed in Earth's dark umbral shadow during a long partial lunar eclipse. The partial eclipse was deep though, deep enough to show the dimmed but reddened light in Earth's shadow. That's a sight often anticipated by fans of total lunar eclipses. Wandering through the constellation Taurus, the eclipsed Moon's dimmer light also made it easier to spot the Pleiades star cluster. The stars of the Seven Sisters share this frame at the upper right, with the almost totally eclipsed Moon.

Introducing Comet Leonard,"Here comes Comet Leonard. Comet C/2021 A1 (Leonard) was discovered as a faint smudge in January 2021 when it was out past Mars -- but its orbit will take the giant shedding ice-ball into the inner Solar System, passing near both Earth and Venus in December before it swoops around the Sun in early January 2022. Although comets are notoriously hard to predict, some estimations have Comet Leonard brightening to become visible to the unaided eye in December.  Comet Leonard was captured just over a week ago already sporting a green-tinged coma and an extended dust tail. The featured picture was composed from 62 images taken through a moderate-sized telescope -- one set of exposures tracking the comet, while another set tracking the background stars. The exposures were taken from the dark skies above the Eastern Sierras (Mountains), near June Lake in California, USA.  Soon after passing near the Earth in mid-December, the comet will shift from northern to southern skies.

Lunar Eclipse over a Skyscraper,"Why is the Moon on top of this building? Planning. It took the astrophotographer careful planning -- including figuring out exactly where to place the camera and exactly when to take the shot -- to create this striking superposition. The single image featured was taken in the early morning hours of November 19, near the peak of the partial lunar eclipse that was occurring as the Moon passed through the Earth's shadow.  At this time, almost the entire Moon -- 99.1 percent of its area -- was in the darkest part of the Earth's shadow.  The building is the Gran Torre Santiago building in Chile, the tallest building in South America.  Although the entire eclipse lasted an impressive six hours, this image had to be taken within just a few seconds to get the alignment right -- the Earth's rotation soon moved the building out of alignment. The next Earth-Moon eclipse will be a total eclipse of the Sun that will occur on December 4 -- but only be visible from the bottom of our world.

The Sun in X-rays from NuSTAR,"Why are the regions above sunspots so hot? Sunspots themselves are a bit cooler than the surrounding solar surface because the magnetic fields that create them reduce convective heating.  It is therefore unusual that regions overhead -- even much higher up in the Sun's corona -- can be hundreds of times hotter. To help find the cause, NASA directed the Earth-orbiting Nuclear Spectroscopic Telescope Array (NuSTAR) satellite to point its very sensitive X-ray telescope at the Sun. Featured here is the Sun in ultraviolet light, shown in a red hue as taken by the orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory (SDO).  Superimposed in false-colored green and blue is emission above sunspots detected by NuSTAR in different bands of high-energy X-rays, highlighting regions of extremely high temperature. Clues about the Sun's atmospheric heating mechanisms come from NuSTAR images like this and shed light on solar nanoflares and microflares as brief bursts of energy that may drive the unusual heating.","x-ray, nustar, region, sunspot, cooler, surrounding, solar, surface, magnetic, field, create, reduce, convective, heating, unusual, overhead, much, higher, corona, hundred, time, hotter, help, find, cause, directed, earth-orbiting, nuclear, spectroscopic, telescope, array, satellite, point, sensitive, featured, ultraviolet, light, shown, taken, orbiting, dynamic, observatory, superimposed, false-colored, green, blue, emission, detected, different, band, high-energy, highlighting, high, temperature, clue, atmospheric, mechanism, come, image, shed, nanoflares, microflares, brief, burst, energy, drive"
Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Star Cluster,"Have you ever seen the Pleiades star cluster? Even if you have, you probably have never seen it as large and clear as this. Perhaps the most famous star cluster on the sky, the bright stars of the Pleiades can be seen without binoculars from even the depths of a light-polluted city.  With a long exposure from a dark location, though, the dust cloud surrounding the Pleiades star cluster becomes very evident. The featured exposure, taken from Florida, USA, covers a sky area several times the size of the full moon.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades lies about 400 light years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).  A common legend with a modern twist is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named, leaving only six of the sister stars visible to the unaided eye. The actual number of Pleiades stars visible, however, may be more or less than seven, depending on the darkness of the surrounding sky and the clarity of the observer's eyesight.

At the Shadow's Edge,"Shaped like a cone tapering into space, the Earth's dark central shadow or umbra has a circular cross-section. It's wider than the Moon at the distance of the Moon's orbit though. But during the lunar eclipse of November 18/19, part of the Moon remained just outside the umbral shadow. The successive pictures in this composite of 5 images from that almost total lunar eclipse were taken over a period of about 1.5 hours. The series is aligned to trace part of the cross-section's circular arc, with the central image at maximum eclipse. It shows a bright, thin sliver of the lunar disk still beyond the shadow's curved edge. Of course, even within the shadow the Moon's surface is not completely dark, reflecting the reddish hues of filtered sunlight scattered into the shadow by Earth's atmosphere.

Great Refractor and Lunar Eclipse,"Rain clouds passed and the dome of the Lick Observatory's 36 inch Great Refractor opened on November 19. The historic telescope was pointed toward a partially eclipsed Moon. Illuminated by dim red lighting to preserve an astronomer's night vision, telescope controls, coordinate dials, and the refractor's 57 foot long barrel were captured in this high dynamic range image. Visible beyond the foreshortened barrel and dome slit, growing brighter after its almost total eclipse phase, the lunar disk created a colorful corona through lingering clouds.

Messier 101,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, but definitely not one of the least. About 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost twice the size of our own Milky Way. M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsontown. Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region of M101 in one of the highest definition spiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble. The sharp image shows stunning features of the galaxy's face-on disk of stars and dust along with background galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself.

A High Cliff on Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"This high cliff occurs not on a planet, not on a moon, but on a comet. It was discovered to be part of the dark nucleus of Comet Churyumov-Gerasimenko (CG) by Rosetta, a robotic spacecraft launched by ESA that rendezvoused with the Sun-orbiting comet in 2014.  The ragged cliff, as featured here, was imaged by Rosetta in 2014. Although towering about one kilometer high, the low surface gravity of Comet CG would likely make it an accessible climb -- and even a jump from the cliff survivable.  At the foot of the cliff is relatively smooth terrain dotted with boulders as large as 20 meters across. Data from Rosetta indicates that the ice in Comet CG has a significantly different deuterium fraction -- and hence likely a different origin -- than the water in Earth's oceans.  Rosetta ended its mission with a controlled impact onto Comet CG in 2016. Comet CG has just completed another close approach to Earth and remains visible through a small telescope.","high, cliff, comet, churyumov-gerasimenko, occurs, planet, moon, discovered, part, dark, nucleus, rosetta, robotic, spacecraft, launched, rendezvoused, sun-orbiting, ragged, featured, imaged, towering, kilometer, surface, gravity, make, accessible, climb, jump, survivable, foot, smooth, terrain, dotted, boulder, large, meter, data, indicates, different, deuterium, fraction, likely, origin, water, earth, ocean, ended, mission, controlled, impact, completed, close, approach, remains, visible, small, telescope"
The Extraordinary Spiral in LL Pegasi,"What created the strange spiral structure on the upper left?  No one is sure, although it is likely related to a star in a binary star system entering the planetary nebula phase, when its outer atmosphere is ejected.  The huge spiral spans about a third of a light year across and, winding four or five complete turns, has a regularity that is without precedent.  Given the expansion rate of the spiral gas, a new layer must appear about every 800 years, a close match to the time it takes for the two stars to orbit each other. The star system that created it is most commonly known as LL Pegasi, but also AFGL 3068 and IRAS 23166+1655.  The featured image was taken in near-infrared light by the Hubble Space Telescope. Why the spiral glows is itself a mystery, with a leading hypothesis being illumination by light reflected from nearby stars.","extraordinary, spiral, pegasi, created, strange, structure, upper, left, sure, related, star, binary, system, entering, planetary, nebula, phase, outer, ejected, huge, span, third, light, year, winding, complete, turn, regularity, precedent, given, expansion, rate, layer, appear, match, time, take, orbit, known, afgl, featured, image, taken, near-infrared, hubble, space, telescope, glow, mystery, leading, hypothesis, illumination, reflected, nearby"
In Motion: Uranus and Moons,"What's that moving across the sky? A planet just a bit too faint to see with the unaided eye: Uranus. The gas giant out past Saturn was tracked earlier this month near opposition -- when it was closest to Earth and at its brightest. The featured video captured by the Bayfordbury Observatory in Hertfordshire, UK is a four-hour time-lapse showing Uranus with its four largest moons in tow: Titania, Oberon, Umbriel and Ariel. Uranus' apparent motion past background stars is really dominated by Earth's own orbital motion around our Sun. 	 The cross seen centered on Uranus is called a diffraction spike and is caused by light diffracting around the four arms that hold one of the telescope's mirrors in place.  The rotation of the diffraction spikes is not caused by the rotation of Uranus but, essentially, by the rotation of the Earth. During the next few months Uranus itself will be visible with binoculars, but, as always, to see its moons will require a telescope.","motion, uranus, moon, moving, planet, faint, unaided, giant, saturn, tracked, month, opposition, closest, earth, brightest, featured, video, captured, bayfordbury, observatory, hertfordshire, four-hour, time-lapse, showing, largest, titania, oberon, umbriel, ariel, apparent, background, star, dominated, orbital, cross, seen, centered, called, diffraction, spike, caused, light, diffracting, hold, telescope, mirror, place, rotation, next, visible, binoculars, require"
A Blue-Banded Blood Moon,"What causes a blue band to cross the Moon during a lunar eclipse? The blue band is real but usually quite hard to see. The featured HDR image of last week's lunar eclipse, however -- taken from Yancheng, China -- has been digitally processed to equalize the Moon's brightness and exaggerate  the colors.  The gray color of the bottom right is the Moon's natural color, directly illuminated by sunlight. The upper left part of the Moon is not directly lit by the Sun since it is being eclipsed -- it in the Earth's shadow. It is faintly lit, though, by sunlight that has passed deep through Earth's atmosphere. This part of the Moon is red -- and called a blood Moon -- for the same reason that Earth's sunsets are red: because air scatters away more blue light than red. The unusual blue band is different -- its color is created by sunlight that has passed high through Earth's atmosphere, where red light is better absorbed by ozone than blue. A total eclipse of the Sun will occur this weekend but, unfortunately, totality be visible only near the Earth's South Pole.

NGC 6822: Barnard's Galaxy,"Grand spiral galaxies often seem to get all the glory, flaunting their young, bright, blue star clusters in beautiful, symmetric spiral arms. But small galaxies form stars too, like nearby NGC 6822, also known as Barnard's Galaxy. Beyond the rich starfields in the constellation Sagittarius, NGC 6822 is a mere 1.5 million light-years away, a member of our Local Group of galaxies. A dwarf irregular galaxy similar to the Small Magellanic Cloud, NGC 6822 is about 7,000 light-years across. Brighter foreground stars in our Milky Way have a spiky appearance.

Comet Leonard and the Whale Galaxy,"Sweeping through northern predawn skies, on November 24 Comet Leonard (C/2021 A1) was caught between two galaxies in this composite telescopic image. Sporting a greenish coma the comet's dusty tail seems to harpoon the heart of NGC 4631 (top) also known as the Whale Galaxy. Of course NGC 4631 and NGC 4656 (bottom, aka the Hockey Stick) are background galaxies some 25 million light-years away. On that date the comet was about 6 light-minutes from our fair planet. Its closest approach to Earth (and even closer approach to Venus) still to come, Comet Leonard will grow brighter in December. Already a good object for binoculars and small telescopes, this comet will likely not return to the inner Solar System.

Iridescent by Moonlight,"In this snapshot from November 18, the Full Moon was not far from Earth's shadow. In skies over Sicily the brightest lunar phase was eclipsed by passing clouds though. The full moonlight was dimmed and momentarily diffracted by small but similar sized water droplets near the edges of the high thin clouds. The resulting iridescence shines with colors like a lunar corona. On that night, the Full Moon was also seen close to the Pleiades star cluster appearing at the lower left of the iridescent cloud bank. The stars of the Seven Sisters were soon to share the sky with a darker, reddened lunar disk.","iridescent, moonlight, snapshot, full, moon, earth, shadow, brightest, lunar, phase, eclipsed, passing, cloud, dimmed, diffracted, small, similar, sized, water, droplet, edge, high, thin, resulting, iridescence, shine, color, corona, night, seen, pleiades, star, cluster, appearing, lower, left, bank, sister, share, darker, reddened, disk"
Total Solar Eclipse Below the Bottom of the World,"Yesterday there was a total solar eclipse visible only at the end of the Earth.  To capture the unusual phenomenon, airplanes took flight below the clouded seascape of Southern Ocean. The featured image shows one relatively spectacular capture where the bright spot is the outer corona of the Sun and the eclipsing Moon is seen as the dark spot in the center.  A wing and engine of the airplane are visible across the left and bottom of the image, while another airplane observing the eclipse is visible on the far left. The dark area of the sky surrounding the eclipsed Sun is called a shadow cone. It is dark because you are looking down a long corridor of air shadowed by the Moon.

Space Station Silhouette on the Moon,"What's that unusual spot on the Moon? It's the International Space Station. Using precise timing, the Earth-orbiting space platform was photographed in front of a partially lit gibbous Moon last month. The featured composite, taken from Payson, Arizona, USA last month, was intricately composed by combining, in part, many 1/2000-second images from a video of the ISS crossing the Moon. A close inspection of this unusually crisp ISS silhouette will reveal the outlines of numerous solar panels and trusses.  The bright crater Tycho is visible on the upper left, as well as comparatively rough, light colored terrain known as highlands, and relatively smooth, dark colored areas known as maria.

Ninety Gravitational Wave Spectrograms and Counting,"very time two massive black holes collide, a loud chirping sound is broadcast out into the universe in gravitational waves. Humanity has only had the technology to hear these unusual chirps for the past seven years, but since then we have heard about 90 -- during the first three observing runs. Featured above are the spectrograms -- plots of gravitational-wave frequency versus time -- of these 90 as detected by the giant detectors of LIGO (in the USA), VIRGO (in Europe), and KAGRA (in Japan). The more energy received on Earth from a collision, the brighter it appears on the graphic. Among many science firsts, these gravitational-radiation chirps are giving humanity an unprecedented inventory of black holes and neutron stars, and a new way to measure the expansion rate of our universe. A fourth gravitational wave observing run with increased sensitivity is currently planned to begin in 2022 December.","ninety, gravitational, wave, spectrogram, counting, time, massive, black, hole, collide, loud, chirping, sound, broadcast, universe, humanity, technology, hear, unusual, chirp, year, heard, first, observing, featured, plot, gravitational-wave, frequency, versus, detected, giant, detector, ligo, europe, kagra, japan, energy, received, earth, collision, brighter, appears, graphic, many, science, gravitational-radiation, giving, unprecedented, inventory, neutron, star, measure, expansion, rate, fourth, increased, sensitivity, planned, begin, december"
Comet Hale-Bopp Over Val Parola Pass,"Comet Hale-Bopp, the Great Comet of 1997, became much brighter than any surrounding stars. It was seen even over bright city lights. Away from city lights, however, it put on quite a spectacular show. Here Comet Hale-Bopp was photographed above Val Parola Pass in the Dolomite mountains surrounding Cortina d'Ampezzo, Italy. Comet Hale-Bopp's blue ion tail, consisting of ions from the comet's nucleus, is pushed out by the solar wind. The white dust tail is composed of larger particles of dust from the nucleus driven by the pressure of sunlight, that orbit behind the comet. Comet Hale-Bopp (C/1995 O1) remained visible to the unaided eye for 18 months -- longer than any other comet in recorded history. The large comet is next expected to return around the year 4385.  This month, Comet Leonard is brightening and may soon become visible to the unaided eye.","comet, hale-bopp, parola, great, became, much, brighter, surrounding, star, seen, bright, city, light, spectacular, show, photographed, dolomite, mountain, cortina, d'ampezzo, italy, blue, tail, consisting, nucleus, pushed, solar, white, dust, composed, larger, particle, driven, pressure, sunlight, orbit, c/1995, remained, visible, unaided, month, longer, recorded, history, large, next, expected, return, year, brightening, become"
A Total Eclipse of the Sun,"Few were able to stand in the Moon's shadow and watch the December 4 total eclipse of the Sun. Determined by celestial mechanics and not geographical boundaries, the narrow path of totality tracked across planet Earth's relatively inaccessible southernmost continent. Still, some enthusiastic and well-insulated eclipse chasers were rewarded with the dazzling spectacle in Antarctica's cold but clear skies. Taken just before the brief totality began, this image from a ground-based telescope inside the edge of the shadow path at Union Glacier catches a glimmer of sunlight near the top of the silhouetted lunar disk. Look closely for the pinkish solar prominences arcing above the Sun's limb. During totality, the magnificent solar corona, the Sun's outer atmosphere, made its much anticipated appearance, seen in the composite view streaming far from the Sun's edge.","total, eclipse, able, stand, moon, shadow, watch, december, determined, celestial, mechanic, geographical, boundary, narrow, path, totality, tracked, planet, earth, inaccessible, southernmost, continent, enthusiastic, well-insulated, chaser, rewarded, dazzling, spectacle, antarctica, cold, clear, taken, brief, began, image, ground-based, telescope, edge, union, glacier, catch, glimmer, sunlight, silhouetted, lunar, disk, look, pinkish, solar, prominence, arcing, limb, magnificent, corona, outer, made, anticipated, appearance, seen, composite, view, streaming"
Eclipse on a Polar Day,"During polar day, in Arctic and Antarctic summer, the Sun stays above the horizon for periods of 24 hours or more. Recorded on December 4, this fisheye timelapse image tracks the Sun in multiple frames as it completes a circle in the summer sky above Union Glacier, Antarctica. Of course on that date, Union Glacier's sky did grow dark even though the Sun was above the horizon. Captured during the brief period of totality, an eclipsed Sun is at bottom center of the composite view. Near the edge of the total eclipse path across planet Earth, the Moon's shadow darkens the sky above.","eclipse, polar, arctic, antarctic, summer, stay, horizon, period, hour, recorded, fisheye, timelapse, image, track, multiple, frame, completes, circle, union, glacier, antarctica, course, date, grow, dark, captured, brief, totality, eclipsed, bottom, center, composite, view, edge, total, path, planet, earth, moon, shadow, darkens"
Postcard from the South Pole,"From this vantage point about three quarters of a mile from planet Earth's geographic South Pole, the December 4 eclipse of the Sun was seen as a partial eclipse. At maximum the New Moon blocked 90 percent of the solar disk. Of course, crews at the South Pole Telescope (left) and BICEP telescope (right) climbed to the roof of Amundsen-Scott station's Dark Sector Laboratory to watch. Centered near the local eclipse maximum, the composite timelapse view features an image of the Sun traversing cold antarctic skies taken every four minutes.

Comet Leonard Before Star Cluster M3,"Comet Leonard is now visible to the unaided eye -- but just barely.  Passing nearest to the Earth today, the comet is best seen this week soon after sunset, toward the west, low on the horizon.  Currently best visible in the north, by late December the comet will best be seen from south of Earth's equator. The featured image of Comet C/2021 A1 (Leonard) was taken a week ago from California, USA. The deep exposure shows in great detail the comet's green gas coma and developing dust tail. The comet -- across our inner Solar System and only light-minutes away -- was captured passing nearly in front of globular star cluster M3. In contrast, M3 is about 35,000 light-years away.  In a week, Comet Leonard will pass unusually close to Venus, but will continue on and be at its closest to the Sun in early January.","comet, leonard, star, cluster, visible, unaided, passing, nearest, earth, today, best, seen, week, sunset, west, horizon, north, late, december, south, equator, featured, image, c/2021, taken, california, deep, exposure, show, great, detail, green, coma, developing, dust, tail, inner, solar, system, light-minutes, captured, front, globular, contrast, light-year, close, venus, continue, closest, early, january"
Meteors and Auroras over Iceland,"What's going on behind that mountain? Quite a bit.  First of all, the mountain itself, named Kirkjufell, is quite old and located in western Iceland near the town of  Grundarfjörður.  In front of the steeply-sloped structure lies a fjord that had just begun to freeze when the above image was taken -- in mid-December of 2012. Although quite faint to the unaided eye, the beautiful colors of background aurorae became quite apparent on the 25-second exposure. What makes this image of particular note, though, is that it also captures streaks from the Geminids meteor shower -- meteors that might not have been evident were the aurora much brighter. Far in the distance, on the left, is the band of our Milky Way Galaxy, while stars from our local part of the Milky Way appear spread across the background.  Tonight the Geminids meteor shower peaks again and may well provide sky enthusiasts with their own memorable visual experiences.","meteor, iceland, going, mountain, first, named, kirkjufell, located, western, town, grundarfjörður, front, steeply-sloped, structure, fjord, begun, freeze, image, taken, mid-december, faint, unaided, beautiful, color, background, aurora, became, quite, apparent, 25-second, exposure, make, particular, note, capture, streak, geminids, shower, evident, much, brighter, distance, left, band, milky, galaxy, star, local, part, appear, spread, tonight, peak, provide, enthusiast, memorable, visual, experience"
HH 666: Carina Dust Pillar with Jet,"To some, it may look like a beehive. In reality, the featured image from the Hubble Space Telescope captures a cosmic pillar of dust, over two-light years long, inside of which is Herbig-Haro 666 -- a young star emitting powerful jets. The structure lies within one of our galaxy's largest star forming regions, the Carina Nebula, shining in southern skies at a distance of about 7,500 light-years.  The pillar's layered outline are shaped by the winds and radiation of Carina's young, hot, massive stars, some of which are still forming inside the nebula.

Comet Leonard from Space,"What does Comet Leonard look like from space?  Today's featured image from Origin.Space's Yangwang-1 space telescope shows not only the currently bright comet -- but several other space delights as well. Taken in optical and ultraviolet light, C/2021 A1 (Leonard) is visible with an extended tail near the image center as it appeared five days ago.  The Earth is visible on the lower right, while layers of the Earth's atmosphere glow diagonally from the lower left to the upper right. The trails of two satellites can be seen in front of a myriad of distant stars that dot the background on the upper left. The faint bands of light running diagonally from the lower right to the upper left are auroras. Finally, the image also caught a meteor streaking just below the airglow. To see Comet Leonard yourself from the Earth's surface during the next few days, look toward the western horizon just after sunset or just before sunrise.","comet, leonard, space, look, today, featured, image, origin.space, yangwang-1, telescope, show, bright, several, delight, taken, optical, ultraviolet, light, c/2021, visible, extended, tail, center, appeared, earth, lower, right, layer, atmosphere, glow, left, upper, trail, satellite, seen, front, myriad, distant, star, faint, band, running, caught, meteor, streaking, airglow, surface, next, western, horizon, sunset, sunrise"
Geminids of the South,"Fireflies flash along a moonlit countryside in this scene taken on the night of December 13/14 from southern Uruguay, planet Earth. On that night meteors fell in the partly cloudy skies above during the annual Geminid meteor shower. Frames recorded over a period of 1.5 hours are aligned in the composite image made with the camera facing south. That direction was opposite the shower's radiant toward the north and so the Geminid meteor streaks appear to converge at an antiradiant below the southern horizon. The shower's apparent radiant (and antiradiant) is just due to perspective though. As Earth sweeps through the dust trail of mysterious asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the dust grains that create the Geminid shower meteors are really moving along parallel tracks. They enter Earth's atmosphere traveling at about 22 kilometers per second.","geminids, south, firefly, flash, moonlit, countryside, scene, taken, night, december, southern, uruguay, planet, earth, meteor, fell, cloudy, annual, geminid, shower, frame, recorded, period, hour, aligned, composite, image, made, camera, facing, direction, radiant, north, streak, appear, converge, antiradiant, horizon, apparent, perspective, sweep, dust, trail, mysterious, asteroid, phaethon, grain, create, moving, parallel, track, atmosphere, traveling, kilometer, second"
Geminid of the North,"An arid expanse of the Tengger Desert in north-central China, planet Earth fills the foreground of this starry scene. A widefield panoramic view, it was recorded shortly after moonset in the local predawn hours of December 14. Pictured in the still dark sky, stars of the northern winter hexagon surround a luminous Milky Way. Seen near the peak of the annual meteor shower, the startling flash of a bright Geminid fireball meteor was also captured on that night. Above the western horizon and just below bright star Capella, its dagger-like trail points back to the meteor shower's radiant in Gemini. Of course, the constellation Gemini is easy to spot. Its twin bright stars, bluish Castor and yellowish Pollux are near top center in the frame.","geminid, north, arid, expanse, tengger, desert, north-central, china, planet, earth, fill, foreground, starry, scene, widefield, panoramic, view, recorded, moonset, local, predawn, hour, december, pictured, dark, star, northern, winter, hexagon, surround, luminous, milky, seen, peak, annual, meteor, shower, startling, flash, bright, fireball, captured, night, western, horizon, capella, dagger-like, trail, point, radiant, gemini, course, constellation, easy, spot, twin, bluish, castor, yellowish, pollux, center, frame"
Stephan's Quintet,"The first identified compact galaxy group, Stephan's Quintet is featured in this eye-catching image constructed with data drawn from the extensive Hubble Legacy Archive. About 300 million light-years away, only four of these five galaxies are actually locked in a cosmic dance of repeated close encounters. The odd man out is easy to spot, though. The interacting galaxies, NGC 7319, 7318A, 7318B, and 7317 have an overall yellowish cast. They also tend to have distorted loops and tails, grown under the influence of disruptive gravitational tides. But the predominantly bluish galaxy, NGC 7320, is closer, just 40 million light-years distant, and isn't part of the interacting group. Stephan's Quintet lies within the boundaries of the high flying constellation Pegasus. At the estimated distance of the quartet of interacting galaxies, this field of view spans about 500,000 light-years. But moving just beyond this field, up and to the right, astronomers can identify another galaxy, NGC 7320C, that is also 300 million light-years distant. Including it would bring the interacting quartet back up to quintet status.","stephan, quintet, identified, compact, galaxy, group, featured, eye-catching, image, constructed, data, extensive, hubble, legacy, archive, light-year, locked, cosmic, dance, repeated, close, encounter, easy, spot, interacting, overall, yellowish, cast, tend, distorted, loop, tail, grown, influence, disruptive, gravitational, tide, bluish, closer, distant, part, boundary, high, flying, constellation, pegasus, estimated, distance, quartet, field, view, span, moving, right, astronomer, identify, including, bring, status"
Planetary Alignment over Italy,"It is not a coincidence that planets line up. That's because all of the planets orbit the Sun in (nearly) a single sheet called the plane of the ecliptic. When viewed from inside that plane -- as Earth dwellers are likely to do -- the planets all appear confined to a single band. It is a coincidence, though, when three of the brightest planets all appear in nearly the same direction.  Such a coincidence was captured earlier this month.  Featured above (right to left), Venus, Saturn, and Jupiter were all imaged together in a line just after sunset, from the San Fermo Hills, Bergamo, Italy. Joining the alignment are Earth's Moon, and the position of the more distant Uranus. Bands of clouds streak across the sky toward the setting Sun.  As Comet Leonard fades, this planetary alignment -- absent the Moon -- should persist for the rest of the month.

The Comet and the Fireball,"This picture was supposed to feature a comet. Specifically, a series of images of the brightest comet of 2021 were being captured: Comet Leonard.  But the universe had other plans. Within a fraction of a second, a meteor so bright it could be called a fireball streaked through just below the comet. And the meteor's flash was even more green than the comet's coma.  The cause of the meteor's green was likely magnesium evaporating from the meteor's pebble-sized core, while the cause of the comet's green was likely diatomic carbon recently ejected from the comet's city-sized nucleus. The images were taken 10 days ago over the Sacramento River and Mt. Lassen in California, USA. The fireball was on the leading edge of this year's Geminid Meteor Shower -- which peaked a few days later. Comet Leonard is now fading after reaching naked-eye visibility last week -- but now is moving into southern skies.

Solstice Sun and Milky Way,"Welcome to December's solstice, first day of winter in the north and summer for the southern hemisphere. Astronomical markers of the seasons, solstice and equinox dates are based on the Sun's place in its annual journey along the ecliptic, through planet Earth's sky. At this solstice, the Sun reaches its maximum southern declination of -23.5 degrees today at 15:59 UTC, while its right ascension coordinate on the celestial sphere is 18 hours. That puts the Sun in the constellation Sagittarius in a direction near the center of our Milky Way galaxy. In fact, if you could see today's Solstice Sun against faint background stars and nebulae (that's really hard to do, especially in the daytime ...) your view might look something like this composited panorama. To make it, images of our fair galaxy were taken under dark Namibian night skies, then stitched together in a panoramic view. From a snapshot made on 2015 December 21, the Sun was digitally overlayed as a brilliant star at today's northern winter solstice position, close to the center of the Milky Way.

Launch of the IXPE Observatory,"Birds don't fly this high.  Airplanes don't go this fast.  The Statue of Liberty weighs less.  No species other than human can even comprehend what is going on, nor could any human just a millennium ago. The launch of a rocket bound for space is an event that inspires awe and challenges description.  Pictured here, a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket lifted off from Kennedy Space Center, Florida earlier this month carrying the Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE).  IXPE is scheduled to observe high-energy objects such as neutron stars, black holes, and the centers of distant galaxies to better determine the physics and geometries that create and control them.  From a standing start, the 300,000+ kilogram rocket ship lifted IXPE up to circle the Earth, where the outside air is too thin to breathe.

Three Planets and a Comet,"Are you still looking for that perfect holiday gift for an astronomer? If your night sky is dark and horizon clear enough, the Solar System may have done your shopping for you. Send them outside after sunset to see three planets and a comet. In this snapshot of the December solstice evening sky from the village of Kirazli, Turkey the brightest celestial beacon is Venus, close to the southwestern horizon at the right. Look left and up to find Saturn shining between clouds. Follow that line farther left and up to bright Jupiter, the Solar System's ruling gas giant. This year's surprise visitor to the inner Solar System, Comet Leonard (C/2021 A1), is near the horizon too. The comet is fainter but forms a nearly equilateral triangle with planets Venus and Saturn in this view. After a dramatic brightening in recent days the comet is just visible to the unaided eye, though a nice pair of binoculars is always a good idea.

M1: The Crab Nebula,"The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first object on Charles Messier's famous 18th century list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab is now known to be a supernova remnant, debris from the death explosion of a massive star, witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. This sharp, ground-based telescopic view combines broadband color data with narrowband data that tracks emission from ionized sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen atoms to explore the tangled filaments within the still expanding cloud. One of the most exotic objects known to modern astronomers, the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star spinning 30 times a second, is visible as a bright spot near the nebula's center. Like a cosmic dynamo, this collapsed remnant of the stellar core powers the Crab's emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Spanning about 12 light-years, the Crab Nebula is a mere 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.

Binoculars will make the diffuse comet easier to spot though, close to the western horizon after sunset. Details revealed in the sharp image show the comet's coma with a greenish tinge, and follow the interaction of the comet's ion tail with magnetic fields in the solar wind. After passing closest to Earth on December 12 and Venus on December 18, Comet Leonard is heading toward perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun on January 3rd.

James Webb Space Telescope over Earth,"There's a big new telescope in space. This one, the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), not only has a mirror over five times larger than Hubble's in area, but can see better in infrared light. The featured picture shows JWST high above the Earth just after being released by the upper stage of an Ariane V rocket, launched yesterday from French Guiana. Over the next month, JWST will move out near the Sun-Earth L2 point where it will co-orbit the Sun with the Earth. During this time and for the next five months, JWST will unravel its segmented mirror and an array of sophisticated scientific instruments -- and test them.

Comet Leonard behind JWST Launch Plume,"Which one of these two streaks is a comet? Although they both have comet-like features, the lower streak is the only real comet. This lower streak shows the coma and tail of Comet Leonard, a city-sized block of rocky ice that is passing through the inner Solar System as it continues its looping orbit around the Sun.  Comet Leonard has recently passed its closest to both the Earth and Venus and will round the Sun next week.  The comet, still visible to the unaided eye, has developed a long and changing tail in recent weeks.  In contrast, the upper streak is the launch plume of the Ariane V rocket that lifted the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) off the Earth two days ago. The featured single-exposure image was taken from Thailand, and the foreground spire is atop a pagoda in Doi Inthanon National Park.

Sun Halo over Sweden,"What's happened to the Sun?  Sometimes it looks like the Sun is being viewed through a giant  lens.  In the featured video, however, there are actually millions of tiny lenses: ice crystals.  Water may freeze in the  atmosphere into small, flat, six-sided, ice crystals.  As these crystals flutter to the ground, much time is spent with their faces flat and parallel to the ground.  An observer may find themselves in the same plane as many of the falling ice crystals near sunrise or sunset.  During this alignment, each crystal can act like a miniature lens, refracting sunlight into our view and creating phenomena like parhelia, the technical term for sundogs.  The featured video was taken in late 2017 on the side of a ski hill at the Vemdalen Ski Resort in central  Sweden.

Giant Storms and High Clouds on Jupiter,"What and where are these large ovals? They are rotating storm clouds on Jupiter imaged last month by NASA's Juno spacecraft. In general, higher clouds are lighter in color, and the lightest clouds visible are the relatively small clouds that dot the lower oval. At 50 kilometers across, however, even these light clouds are not small.  They are so high up that they cast shadows on the swirling oval below. The featured image has been processed to enhance color and contrast. Large ovals are usually regions of high pressure that span over 1000 kilometers and can last for years. The largest oval on Jupiter is the Great Red Spot (not pictured), which has lasted for at least hundreds of years. Studying cloud dynamics on Jupiter with Juno images enables a better understanding of dangerous typhoons and hurricanes on Earth.

The Further Tail of Comet Leonard,"Comet Leonard, brightest comet of 2021, is at the lower left of these two panels captured on December 29 in dark Atacama desert skies. Heading for its perihelion on January 3 Comet Leonard's visible tail has grown. Stacked exposures with a wide angle lens (also displayed in a reversed B/W scheme for contrast), trace the complicated ion tail for an amazing 60 degrees, with bright Jupiter shining near the horizon at lower right. Material vaporizing from Comet Leonard's nucleus, a mass of dust, rock, and ices about 1 kilometer across, has produced the long tail of ionized gas fluorescing in the sunlight. Likely flares on the comet's nucleus and buffeting by magnetic fields and the solar wind in recent weeks have resulted in the tail's irregular pinched and twisted appearance. Still days from its closest approach to the Sun, Comet Leonard's activity should continue. The comet is south of the Solar System's ecliptic plane as it sweeps through the southern constellation Microscopium.","tail, comet, leonard, brightest, lower, left, panel, captured, dark, atacama, desert, heading, perihelion, january, visible, grown, stacked, exposure, wide, angle, lens, displayed, reversed, scheme, contrast, trace, complicated, amazing, degree, bright, jupiter, shining, horizon, right, material, vaporizing, nucleus, mass, dust, rock, kilometer, produced, ionized, fluorescing, sunlight, likely, flare, buffeting, magnetic, field, solar, wind, recent, week, resulted, irregular, pinched, twisted, appearance, closest, approach, activity, continue, system, ecliptic, plane, sweep, southern, constellation, microscopium"
JWST on the Road to L2,"This timelapse gif tracks the James Webb Space Telescope as it streaks across the stars of Orion on its journey to a destination beyond the Moon. Recorded on December 28, 12 consecutive exposures each 10 minutes long were aligned and combined with a subsequent color image of the background stars to create the animation. About 2.5 days after its December 25 launch, JWST cruised past the altitude of the Moon's orbit as it climbed up the gravity ridge from Earth to reach a halo orbit around L2, an Earth-Sun Lagrange point. Lagrange points are convenient locations in space where the combined gravitational attraction of one massive body (Earth) orbiting another massive body (Sun) is in balance with the centripetal force needed to move along with them. So much smaller masses, like spacecraft, will tend to stay there. One of 5 Lagrange points, L2 is about 1.5 million kilometers from Earth directly along the Earth-Sun line. JWST will arrive at L2 on January 23, 29 days after launch. While relaxing in Earth's surface gravity you can follow the James Webb Space Telescope's progress and complicated deployment online.","jwst, road, timelapse, track, james, webb, space, telescope, streak, star, orion, journey, destination, moon, recorded, consecutive, exposure, minute, aligned, combined, subsequent, color, image, background, create, animation, december, launch, cruised, past, altitude, orbit, climbed, gravity, ridge, earth, reach, halo, earth-sun, lagrange, point, convenient, location, gravitational, attraction, massive, body, orbiting, balance, centripetal, force, needed, move, smaller, mass, spacecraft, tend, stay, kilometer, line, arrive, january, relaxing, surface, follow, progress, complicated, deployment, online"
The Full Moon of 2021,"very Full Moon of 2021 shines in this year-spanning astrophoto project, a composite portrait of the familiar lunar nearside at each brightest lunar phase. Arranged by moonth, the year progresses in stripes beginning at the top. Taken with the same camera and lens the stripes are from Full Moon images all combined at the same pixel scale. The stripes still look mismatched, but they show that the Full Moon's angular size changes throughout the year depending on its distance from Kolkata, India, planet Earth. The calendar month, a full moon name, distance in kilometers, and angular size is indicated for each stripe. Angular size is given in minutes of arc corresponding to 1/60th of a degree. The largest Full Moon is near a perigee or closest approach in May. The smallest is near an apogee, the most distant Full Moon in December. Of course the full moons of May and November also slid into Earth's shadow during 2021's two lunar eclipses.","full, moon, shine, year-spanning, astrophoto, project, composite, portrait, familiar, lunar, brightest, phase, arranged, moonth, year, progress, stripe, beginning, taken, camera, lens, image, combined, pixel, scale, look, mismatched, show, angular, size, change, depending, distance, kolkata, india, planet, earth, calendar, month, name, kilometer, indicated, given, minute, corresponding, degree, largest, perigee, closest, approach, smallest, apogee, distant, december, course, november, slid, shadow, eclipse"
Quadruple Lunar Halo Over Winter Road,"Sometimes falling ice crystals make the atmosphere into a giant lens causing arcs and halos to appear around the Sun or Moon. One Saturday night in 2012 was just such a time near Madrid, Spain, where a winter sky displayed not only a bright Moon but four rare lunar halos.  The brightest object, near the top of the featured image, is the Moon. Light from the Moon refracts through tumbling hexagonal ice crystals into a somewhat rare 22-degree halo seen surrounding the Moon. Elongating the 22-degree arc horizontally is a more rare circumscribed halo caused by column ice crystals. Even more rare, some moonlight refracts through more distant tumbling ice crystals to form a (third) rainbow-like arc 46 degrees from the Moon and appearing here just above a picturesque winter landscape. Furthermore, part of a whole 46-degree circular halo is also visible, so that an extremely rare -- especially for the Moon --  quadruple halo  was captured. Far in the background is a famous winter skyscape that includes Sirius, the belt of Orion, and Betelgeuse -- visible between the inner and outer arcs. Halos and arcs typically last for minutes to hours, so if you do see one there should be time to invite family, friends or neighbors to share your unusual lensed vista of the sky.","quadruple, lunar, halo, winter, road, falling, crystal, make, atmosphere, giant, lens, causing, appear, moon, saturday, night, time, madrid, spain, displayed, bright, rare, brightest, object, featured, image, light, refracts, tumbling, hexagonal, 22-degree, seen, surrounding, elongating, circumscribed, caused, column, moonlight, distant, form, third, rainbow-like, degree, appearing, picturesque, landscape, part, whole, 46-degree, circular, visible, captured, famous, skyscape, includes, sirius, belt, orion, betelgeuse, inner, outer, last, minute, hour, invite, family, friend, neighbor, share, unusual, lensed, vista"
Comet Leonard's Long Tail,"You couldn't see Comet Leonard’s extremely long tail with a telescope — it was just too long. You also couldn't see it with binoculars — still too long. Or with your eyes -- it was too dim. Or from a city — the sky was too bright. But from a dark location with a low horizon — your camera could. And still might -- if the comet survives today's closest encounter with the Sun, which occurs between the orbits of Mercury and Venus. The featured picture was created from two deep and wide-angle camera images taken from La Palma in the Canary Islands of Spain late last month.  Afterwards, if it survives, what is left of Comet Leonard's nucleus will head out of our Solar System, never to return.","comet, leonard, long, tail, telescope, binoculars, city, bright, dark, location, horizon, camera, survives, today, closest, encounter, occurs, orbit, mercury, venus, featured, picture, created, deep, wide-angle, image, taken, palma, canary, island, spain, late, last, month, afterwards, left, nucleus, head, solar, system, return"
Moons Beyond Rings at Saturn,"What's happened to that moon of Saturn? Nothing -- Saturn's moon Rhea is just partly hidden behind Saturn's rings. In 2010, the robotic Cassini spacecraft then orbiting Saturn took this narrow-angle view looking across the Solar System's most famous rings. Rings visible in the foreground include the thin F ring on the outside and the much wider A and B rings just interior to it. Although it seems to be hovering over the rings, Saturn's moon Janus is actually far behind them.  Janus is one of Saturn's smaller moons and measures only about 180 kilometers across. Farther out from the camera is the heavily cratered Rhea, a much larger moon measuring 1,500 kilometers across. The top of Rhea is visible only through gaps in the rings. After more than a decade of exploration and discovery, the Cassini spacecraft ran low on fuel in 2017 and was directed to enter Saturn's atmosphere, where it surely melted.

A Year of Sunrises,"Does the Sun always rise in the same direction?  No.  As the months change, the direction toward the rising Sun changes, too.  The featured image shows the direction of sunrise every month during 2021 as seen from the city of Edmonton, Alberta, Canada. The camera in the image is always facing due east, with north toward the left and south toward the right.  As shown in an accompanying video, the top image was taken in 2020 December, while the bottom image was captured in 2021 December, making 13 images in total. Although the Sun always rises in the east in general, it rises furthest to the south of east near the December solstice, and furthest north of east near the June solstice. In many countries, the December Solstice is considered an official change in season: for example the first day of winter in the North.  Solar heating and stored energy in the Earth's surface and atmosphere are near their lowest during winter, making the winter season the coldest of the year.

The Last Days of Venus as the Evening Star,"That's not a young crescent Moon posing behind cathedral towers after sunset. It's Venus in a crescent phase. About 40 million kilometers away and about 2 percent illuminated by sunlight, it was captured with camera and telephoto lens in this series of exposures as it set in western skies on January 1 from Veszprem, Hungary. The bright celestial beacon was languishing in the evening twilight, its days as the Evening Star coming to a close as 2022 began. But it was also growing larger in apparent size and becoming an ever thinner crescent in telescopic views. Heading toward a (non-judgemental) inferior conjunction, the inner planet will be positioned between Earth and Sun on January 9 and generally lost from view in the solar glare. A crescent Venus will soon reappear though. Rising in the east by mid-month just before the Sun as the brilliant Morning Star.

Ecstatic Solar Eclipse,"A male Adelie penguin performed this Ecstatic Vocalization in silhouette during the December 4 solar eclipse, the final eclipse of 2021. Of course his Ecstatic Vocalization is a special display that male penguins use to claim their territory and advertise their condition. This penguin's territory, at Cape Crozier Antarctica, is located in one of the largest Adelie penguin colonies. The colony has been studied by researchers for over 25 years. From there, last December's eclipse was about 80 percent total when seen at its maximum phase as the Moon's shadow crossed planet Earth's southernmost continent.

Quadrantids of the North,"Named for a forgotten constellation, the Quadrantid Meteor Shower puts on an annual show for planet Earth's northern hemisphere skygazers. The shower's radiant on the sky lies within the old, astronomically obsolete constellation Quadrans Muralis. That location is not far from the Big Dipper, at the boundaries of the modern constellations Bootes and Draco. In fact north star Polaris is just below center in this frame and the Big Dipper asterism (known to some as the Plough) is above it, with the meteor shower radiant to the right. Pointing back toward the radiant, Quadrantid meteors streak through the night in the panoramic skyscape, a composite of images taken in the hours around the shower's peak on January 4, 2022. Arrayed in the foreground are radio telescopes of the Chinese Spectral Radioheliograph, Mingantu Observing Station, Inner Mongolia, China.

Hubble's Jupiter and the Shrinking Great Red Spot,"What will become of Jupiter's Great Red Spot?  Gas giant Jupiter is the solar system's largest world with about 320 times the mass of planet Earth. Jupiter is home to one of the largest and longest lasting storm systems known, the Great Red Spot (GRS), visible to the left. The GRS is so large it could swallow Earth, although it has been shrinking.  Comparison with historical notes indicate that the storm spans only about one third of the exposed surface area it had 150 years ago. NASA's Outer Planets Atmospheres Legacy (OPAL) program has been monitoring the storm more recently using the Hubble Space Telescope. The featured Hubble OPAL image shows Jupiter as it appeared in 2016, processed in a way that makes red hues appear quite vibrant. Modern GRS data indicate that the storm continues to constrict its surface area, but is also becoming slightly taller, vertically.  No one knows the future of the GRS, including the possibility that if the shrinking trend continues, the GRS might one day even do what smaller spots on Jupiter have done -- disappear completely.

Comet Leonard's Tail Wag,"Why does Comet Leonard's tail wag? The featured time-lapse video shows the ion tail of Comet C/2021 A1 (Leonard) as it changed over ten days early last month.  The video was taken by NASA's Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory-Ahead (STEREO-A) spacecraft that co-orbits the Sun at roughly the same distance as the Earth. Each image in this 29-degree field was subtracted from following image to create frames that highlight differences. The video clearly shows Comet Leonard's long ion tail extending, wagging, and otherwise being blown around by the solar wind -- a stream of fast-moving ions that stream out from the Sun.  Since the video was taken, Comet Leonard continued plunging toward the Sun, reached its closest approach to the Sun between the orbits of Mercury and Venus, survived this closest approach without breaking apart, and is now fading as heads out of our Solar System.

Orion's Belt Region in Gas and Dust,"You may have seen Orion's belt before -- but not like this. The three bright stars across this image are, from left to right, Mintaka, Alnilam, and Alnitak: the iconic belt stars of Orion. The rest of the stars in the frame have been digitally removed to highlight the surrounding clouds of glowing gas and dark dust. Some of these clouds have intriguing shapes, including the Horsehead and Flame Nebulas, both near Alnitak on the lower right.  This deep image, taken last month from the Marathon Skypark and Observatory in Marathon, Texas, USA, spans about 5 degrees, required about 20 hours of exposure, and was processed to reveal the gas and dust that we would really see if we were much closer. The famous Orion Nebula is off to the upper right of this colorful field.  The entire region lies only about 1,500 light-years distant and so is one of the closest and best studied star formation nurseries known.

Comet Leonard Closeup from Australia,"What does Comet Leonard look like up close? Although we can't go there, imaging the comet's coma and inner tails through a small telescope gives us a good idea.  As the name implies, the ion tail is made of ionized gas -- gas energized by ultraviolet light from the Sun and pushed outward by the solar wind.  The solar wind is quite structured and sculpted by the Sun's complex and ever changing magnetic field. The effect of the variable solar wind combined with different gas jets venting from the comet's nucleus accounts for the tail's complex structure.  Following the wind, structure in Comet Leonard's tail can be seen to move outward from the Sun even alter its wavy appearance over time.  The blue color of the ion tail is dominated by recombining carbon monoxide molecules, while the green color of the coma surrounding the head of the comet is created mostly by a slight amount of recombining diatomic carbon molecules. Diatomic carbon is destroyed by sunlight in about 50 hours -- which is why its green glow does not make it far into the ion tail. The featured image was taken on January 2 from Siding Spring Observatory in Australia.  Comet Leonard, presently best viewed from Earth's Southern Hemisphere, has rounded the Sun and is now headed out of the Solar System.","comet, leonard, closeup, look, imaging, coma, inner, tail, small, telescope, give, good, idea, name, implies, made, ionized, energized, ultraviolet, light, pushed, solar, wind, structured, sculpted, complex, changing, magnetic, field, effect, variable, combined, different, venting, nucleus, account, structure, following, seen, move, wavy, appearance, time, blue, color, dominated, recombining, carbon, monoxide, molecule, green, surrounding, head, created, slight, amount, diatomic, destroyed, sunlight, hour, glow, make, featured, image, taken, january, siding, spring, observatory, australia, best, viewed, earth, southern, rounded, headed, system"
Supernova Remnant Simeis 147,"It's easy to get lost following the intricate, looping, twisting filaments in this detailed image of supernova remnant Simeis 147. Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240 it goes by the popular nickname, the Spaghetti Nebula. Seen toward the boundary of the constellations Taurus and Auriga, it covers nearly 3 degrees or 6 full moons on the sky. That's about 150 light-years at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years. This composite includes image data taken through narrow-band filters where reddish emission from ionized hydrogen atoms and doubly ionized oxygen atoms in faint blue-green hues trace the shocked, glowing gas. The supernova remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000 years, meaning light from the massive stellar explosion first reached Earth 40,000 years ago. But the expanding remnant is not the only aftermath. The cosmic catastrophe also left behind a spinning neutron star or pulsar, all that remains of the original star's core.","supernova, remnant, simeis, easy, lost, following, intricate, looping, twisting, filament, detailed, image, cataloged, sharpless, 2-240, popular, nickname, spaghetti, nebula, seen, boundary, constellation, taurus, auriga, degree, full, moon, light-year, stellar, debris, cloud, estimated, distance, composite, includes, data, taken, narrow-band, filter, reddish, emission, ionized, hydrogen, atom, oxygen, faint, blue-green, trace, shocked, glowing, year, meaning, light, massive, explosion, reached, earth, expanding, aftermath, cosmic, catastrophe, left, spinning, neutron, star, pulsar, remains, original, core"
NGC 1566: The Spanish Dancer Spiral Galaxy,"An island universe of billions of stars, NGC 1566 lies about 60 million light-years away in the southern constellation Dorado. Popularly known as the Spanish Dancer galaxy, it's seen face-on from our Milky Way perspective. A gorgeous grand design spiral, this galaxy's two graceful spiral arms span over 100,000 light-years, traced by bright blue star clusters, pinkish starforming regions, and swirling cosmic dust lanes. NGC 1566's flaring center makes the spiral one of the closest and brightest Seyfert galaxies. It likely houses a central supermassive black hole wreaking havoc on surrounding stars, gas, and dust.

Galileo's Europa,"Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft recorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered evidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides a deep, global ocean. Galileo's Europa image data has been remastered here, with improved calibrations to produce a color image approximating what the human eye might see. Europa's long curving fractures hint at the subsurface liquid water.  The tidal flexing the large moon experiences in its elliptical orbit around Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid. But more tantalizing is the possibility that even in the absence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to support life, making Europa one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth. What kind of life could thrive in a deep, dark, subsurface ocean? Consider planet Earth's own extreme shrimp.","galileo, europa, looping, jovian, system, late, spacecraft, recorded, stunning, view, uncovered, evidence, moon, surface, likely, hide, deep, global, ocean, image, data, remastered, improved, calibration, produce, color, approximating, human, long, curving, fracture, hint, subsurface, liquid, water, tidal, flexing, large, experience, elliptical, orbit, jupiter, supply, energy, keep, tantalizing, possibility, absence, sunlight, process, support, life, making, best, place, look, earth, kind, thrive, dark, consider, planet, extreme, shrimp"
A Retreating Thunderstorm at Sunset,"What type of cloud is that? This retreating cumulonimbus cloud, more commonly called a thundercloud, is somewhat unusual as it contains the unusual bumpiness of a mammatus cloud on the near end, while simultaneously producing falling rain on the far end. Taken in mid-2013 in southern Alberta, Canada, the cloud is moving to the east, into the distance, as the sun sets in the west, behind the camera. In the featured image, graphic sunset colors cross the sky to give the already photogenic cloud striking orange and pink hues. A darkening blue sky covers the background.

Chamaeleon Dark Nebulas,"Sometimes the dark dust of interstellar space has an angular elegance.  Such is the case toward the far-south constellation of Chamaeleon. Normally too faint to see, dark dust is best known for blocking visible light from stars and galaxies behind it. In this four-hour exposure, however, the dust is seen mostly in light of its own, with its strong red and near-infrared colors giving creating a brown hue. Contrastingly blue, the bright star Beta Chamaeleontis is visible just to the right of center, with the dust that surrounds it preferentially reflecting blue light from its primarily blue-white color.  All of the pictured stars and dust occur in our own Milky Way Galaxy with -- but one notable exception: the white spot just below Beta Chamaeleontis is the galaxy IC 3104 which lies far in the distance.  Interstellar dust is mostly created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars and dispersed into space by stellar light, stellar winds, and stellar explosions such as supernovas.","chamaeleon, dark, nebula, dust, interstellar, space, angular, elegance, case, far-south, constellation, faint, best, known, blocking, visible, light, star, galaxy, four-hour, exposure, seen, strong, near-infrared, color, giving, creating, brown, blue, bright, beta, chamaeleontis, right, center, surround, reflecting, blue-white, pictured, occur, milky, notable, exception, white, spot, distance, created, cool, giant, dispersed, stellar, explosion, supernova"

M31: The Andromeda Galaxy,"The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy. Even at some two and a half million light-years distant, this immense spiral galaxy -- spanning over 200,000 light years -- is visible, although as a faint, nebulous cloud in the constellation Andromeda. In contrast, a bright yellow nucleus, dark winding dust lanes, and expansive spiral arms dotted with blue star clusters and red nebulae, are recorded in this stunning telescopic image which combines data from orbiting Hubble with ground-based images from Subaru and Mayall. In only about 5 billion years, the Andromeda galaxy may be even easier to see -- as it will likely span the entire night sky -- just before it merges with our Milky Way Galaxy.","andromeda, galaxy, distant, object, visible, unaided, great, half, light-year, immense, spiral, spanning, light, year, faint, nebulous, cloud, constellation, contrast, bright, yellow, nucleus, dark, winding, dust, lane, expansive, dotted, blue, star, cluster, nebula, recorded, stunning, telescopic, image, combine, data, orbiting, hubble, ground-based, subaru, easier, likely, span, entire, night, merges, milky"
NGC 7822 in Cepheus,"Hot, young stars and cosmic pillars of gas and dust seem to crowd into NGC 7822. At the edge of a giant molecular cloud toward the northern constellation Cepheus, the glowing star forming region lies about 3,000 light-years away. Within the nebula, bright edges and dark shapes stand out in this colorful telescopic skyscape. The image includes data from narrowband filters, mapping emission from atomic oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur into blue, green, and red hues. The emission line and color combination has become well-known as the Hubble palette.  The atomic emission is powered by energetic radiation from the central hot stars. Their powerful winds and radiation sculpt and erode the denser pillar shapes and clear out a characteristic cavity light-years across the center of the natal cloud. Stars could still be forming inside the pillars by gravitational collapse but as the pillars are eroded away, any forming stars will ultimately be cutoff from their reservoir of star stuff. This field of view spans about 40 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 7822.","cepheus, young, star, cosmic, pillar, dust, seem, crowd, edge, giant, molecular, cloud, northern, constellation, glowing, forming, region, light-year, nebula, bright, dark, shape, stand, colorful, telescopic, skyscape, image, includes, data, mapping, emission, atomic, oxygen, hydrogen, sulfur, blue, green, line, color, combination, become, well-known, hubble, palette, powered, energetic, radiation, central, powerful, wind, sculpt, erode, denser, clear, characteristic, cavity, center, natal, gravitational, collapse, eroded, cutoff, reservoir, stuff, field, view, span, estimated, distance"
Young Star Jet MHO 2147,"Laser guide stars and adaptive optics sharpened this stunning ground-based image of stellar jets from the Gemini South Observatory, Chilean Andes, planet Earth. These twin outflows of MHO 2147 are from a young star in formation. It lies toward the central Milky Way and the boundary of the constellations Sagittarius and Ophiuchus at an estimated distance of some 10,000 light-years. At center, the star itself is obscured by a dense region of cold dust. But the infrared image still traces the sinuous jets across a frame that would span about 5 light-years at the system's estimated distance. Driven outward by the young rotating star, the apparent wandering direction of the jets is likely due to precession. Part of a multiple star system, the young star's rotational axis would slowly precess or wobble like a top under the gravitation influence of its nearby companions.","young, star, laser, guide, adaptive, optic, sharpened, stunning, ground-based, image, stellar, gemini, south, observatory, chilean, andes, planet, earth, twin, formation, central, milky, boundary, constellation, sagittarius, estimated, distance, light-year, center, obscured, dense, region, cold, dust, infrared, trace, sinuous, frame, span, system, driven, rotating, apparent, wandering, direction, precession, part, multiple, rotational, axis, precess, wobble, gravitation, influence, nearby, companion"
The Full Moon and the Dancer,"On Monday, January's Full Moon rose as the Sun set. Spotted near the eastern horizon, its warm hues are seen in this photo taken near Cagliari, capital city of the Italian island of Sardinia. Of course the familiar patterns of light and dark across the Moon's nearside are created by bright rugged highlands and dark smooth lunar maria. Traditionally the patterns are seen as pareidolia, giving the visual illusion of a human face like the Man in the Moon, or familiar animal like the Moon rabbit. But for a moment the swarming murmuration, also known as a flock of starlings, frozen in the snapshot's field of view lends another pareidolic element to the scene. Some see the graceful figure of a dancer enchanted by moonlight.","full, moon, dancer, monday, january, rose, spotted, eastern, horizon, warm, seen, photo, taken, cagliari, capital, city, italian, island, sardinia, course, familiar, pattern, light, dark, nearside, created, rugged, highland, smooth, lunar, maria, pareidolia, giving, visual, illusion, human, face, animal, rabbit, moment, swarming, murmuration, known, flock, starling, frozen, snapshot, field, view, lends, pareidolic, element, scene, graceful, figure, enchanted, moonlight"
"Saturn, Tethys, Rings, and Shadows","Seen from ice moon Tethys, rings and shadows would display fantastic views of the Saturnian system. Haven't dropped in on Tethys lately? Then this gorgeous ringscape from the Cassini spacecraft will have to do for now. Caught in sunlight just below and left of picture center in 2005, Tethys itself is about 1,000 kilometers in diameter and orbits not quite five saturn-radii from the center of the gas giant planet. At that distance (around 300,000 kilometers) it is well outside Saturn's main bright rings, but Tethys is still one of five major moons that find themselves within the boundaries of the faint and tenuous outer E ring. Discovered in the 1980s, two very small moons Telesto and Calypso are locked in stable along Tethys' orbit. Telesto precedes and Calypso follows Tethys as the trio circles Saturn.","saturn, tethys, ring, shadow, seen, moon, display, fantastic, view, saturnian, system, dropped, gorgeous, ringscape, cassini, spacecraft, caught, sunlight, left, picture, center, kilometer, diameter, orbit, saturn-radii, giant, planet, distance, main, bright, major, find, boundary, faint, tenuous, outer, discovered, small, telesto, calypso, locked, stable, precedes, follows, trio, circle"
Rigel and the Witch Head Nebula,"By starlight this eerie visage shines in the dark, a crooked profile evoking its popular name, the Witch Head Nebula. In fact, this entrancing telescopic portrait gives the impression that the witch has fixed her gaze on Orion's bright supergiant star Rigel. More formally known as IC 2118, the Witch Head Nebula spans about 50 light-years and is composed of interstellar dust grains reflecting Rigel's starlight. The blue color of the Witch Head Nebula and of the dust surrounding Rigel is caused not only by Rigel's intense blue starlight but because the dust grains scatter blue light more efficiently than red. The same physical process causes Earth's daytime sky to appear blue, although the scatterers in Earth's atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen. Rigel, the Witch Head Nebula, and gas and dust that surrounds them lie about 800 light-years away.","rigel, witch, head, nebula, starlight, eerie, visage, shine, dark, crooked, profile, evoking, popular, name, fact, entrancing, telescopic, portrait, give, impression, fixed, gaze, orion, bright, supergiant, star, known, span, light-year, composed, interstellar, dust, grain, reflecting, blue, color, surrounding, caused, intense, scatter, light, physical, process, cause, earth, daytime, appear, scatterers, atmosphere, molecule, nitrogen, oxygen, surround"
Video: Comet Leonard over One Hour,"Which direction is this comet heading?  Judging by the tail, one might imagine that Comet Leonard is traveling towards the bottom right, but a full 3D analysis shows it traveling almost directly away from the camera.  With this perspective, the dust tail is trailed towards the camera and can only be seen as a short yellow-white glow near the head of the comet.  The bluish ion tail, however, is made up of escaping ions that are forced directly away from the Sun by the solar wind -- but channeled along the Sun's magnetic field lines.  The Sun's magnetic field is quite complex, however, and occasionally solar magnetic reconnection will break the ion tail into knots that are pushed away from the Sun. One such knot is visible in the featured one-hour time-lapse video captured in late December from Thailand.  Comet Leonard is now fading as it heads out of our Solar System.

"Stars, Dust, and Gas Near Antares","Why is the sky near Antares and Rho Ophiuchi so dusty yet colorful?  The colors result from a mixture of objects and processes.  Fine dust -- illuminated from the front by starlight -- produces blue reflection nebulae. Gaseous clouds whose atoms are excited by ultraviolet starlight produce reddish emission nebulae. Backlit dust clouds block starlight and so appear dark.   Antares, a red supergiant and one of the brighter stars in the night sky, lights up the yellow-red clouds on the lower right of the featured image. The Rho Ophiuchi star system lies at the center of the blue reflection nebula on the top left.   The distant globular cluster of stars M4 is visible above and to the right of Antares. These star clouds are even more colorful than humans can see, emitting light across the electromagnetic spectrum.","star, dust, antares, ophiuchi, dusty, colorful, color, result, mixture, object, process, fine, illuminated, front, starlight, produce, blue, reflection, gaseous, cloud, atom, excited, ultraviolet, reddish, emission, nebula, backlit, block, appear, dark, supergiant, brighter, night, light, yellow-red, lower, right, featured, image, system, center, left, distant, globular, cluster, visible, human, emitting, electromagnetic, spectrum"
South of Orion,"South of the large star-forming region known as the Orion Nebula, lies bright blue reflection nebula NGC 1999. At the edge of the Orion molecular cloud complex some 1,500 light-years distant, NGC 1999's illumination is provided by the embedded variable star V380 Orionis. The nebula is marked with a dark sideways T-shape at center right in this telescopic vista that spans about two full moons on the sky. Its dark shape was once assumed to be an obscuring dust cloud seen in silhouette. But infrared data suggest the shape is likely a hole blown through the nebula itself by energetic young stars. In fact, this region abounds with energetic young stars producing jets and outflows with luminous shock waves. Cataloged as Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, named for astronomers George Herbig and Guillermo Haro, the shocks have intense reddish hues. HH1 and HH2 are just below and right of NGC 1999. HH222, also known as the Waterfall nebula, looks like a red gash near top right in the frame. To create the shocks stellar jets push through the surrounding material at speeds of hundreds of kilometers per second.","south, orion, large, star-forming, region, known, nebula, bright, blue, reflection, edge, molecular, cloud, complex, light-year, distant, illumination, provided, embedded, variable, star, v380, orionis, marked, dark, sideways, t-shape, center, right, telescopic, vista, span, full, moon, shape, assumed, obscuring, dust, seen, silhouette, infrared, data, suggest, likely, hole, blown, energetic, young, fact, abounds, producing, luminous, shock, wave, cataloged, herbig-haro, object, named, astronomer, george, herbig, guillermo, haro, intense, reddish, hh222, waterfall, look, gash, frame, create, stellar, push, surrounding, material, speed, hundred, kilometer, second"
"Western Moon, Eastern Sea","The Mare Orientale, Latin for Eastern Sea, is one of the most striking large scale lunar features. The youngest of the large lunar impact basins it's very difficult to see from an earthbound perspective. Still, taken during a period of favorable tilt, or libration of the lunar nearside, the Eastern Sea can be found near top center in this sharp telescopic view, extremely foreshortened along the Moon's western edge. Formed by the impact of an asteroid over 3 billion years ago and nearly 1000 kilometers across, the impact basin's concentric circular features are ripples in the lunar crust. But they are a little easier to spot in more direct images of the region taken from lunar orbit. So why is the Eastern Sea at the Moon's western edge? The Mare Orientale lunar feature was named before 1961. That's when the convention labeling east and west on lunar maps was reversed.","western, moon, eastern, mare, orientale, latin, striking, large, scale, lunar, feature, youngest, impact, basin, difficult, perspective, taken, period, favorable, tilt, libration, nearside, found, center, sharp, telescopic, view, foreshortened, edge, formed, asteroid, year, kilometer, concentric, circular, ripple, crust, easier, spot, direct, image, region, orbit, named, convention, labeling, east, west, reversed"
The Fornax Cluster of Galaxies,"Named for the southern constellation toward which most of its galaxies can be found, the Fornax Cluster is one of the closest clusters of galaxies. About 62 million light-years away, it is almost 20 times more distant than our neighboring Andromeda Galaxy, and only about 10 percent farther than the better known and more populated Virgo Galaxy Cluster. Seen across this two degree wide field-of-view, almost every yellowish splotch on the image is an elliptical galaxy in the Fornax cluster. Elliptical galaxies NGC 1399 and NGC 1404 are the dominant, bright cluster members toward the upper left (but not the spiky foreground stars). A standout barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 is visible on the lower right as a prominent Fornax cluster member.","fornax, cluster, galaxy, named, southern, constellation, found, closest, light-year, time, distant, neighboring, andromeda, percent, known, populated, virgo, seen, degree, wide, field-of-view, yellowish, splotch, image, elliptical, dominant, bright, member, upper, left, spiky, foreground, star, standout, barred, spiral, visible, lower, right, prominent"
A Solar Prominence from SOHO,"How can gas float above the Sun?   Twisted magnetic fields arching from the solar surface can trap ionized gas, suspending it in huge looping structures.  These majestic plasma arches are seen as prominences above the solar limb.  In 1999, this dramatic and detailed image was recorded by the Extreme ultraviolet Image Telescope (EIT) on board the space-based SOHO observatory in the light emitted by ionized Helium.  It shows hot plasma escaping into space as a fiery prominence breaks free from magnetic confinement a hundred thousand kilometers above the Sun.  These awesome events bear watching as they can affect communications and power systems over 100 million kilometers away on planet Earth. In late 2020 our Sun passed the solar minimum of its 11-year cycle and is now showing  increased surface activity.","solar, prominence, soho, float, twisted, magnetic, field, arching, surface, trap, ionized, suspending, huge, looping, structure, majestic, plasma, arch, seen, limb, dramatic, detailed, image, recorded, extreme, ultraviolet, telescope, board, space-based, observatory, light, emitted, helium, show, escaping, space, fiery, break, free, confinement, hundred, kilometer, awesome, event, watching, affect, communication, power, system, planet, earth, late, passed, minimum, 11-year, cycle, showing, increased, activity"
Carina Nebula North,"The Great Carina Nebula is home to strange stars and iconic nebulas. Named for its home constellation, the huge star-forming region is larger and brighter than the Great Orion Nebula but less well known because it is so far south -- and because so much of humanity lives so far north.  The featured image shows in great detail the northern-most part of the Carina Nebula. Visible nebulas include the semi-circular filaments surrounding the active star Wolf-Rayet 23 (WR23) on the far left.  Just left of center is the Gabriela Mistral Nebula consisting of an emission nebula of glowing gas (IC 2599) surrounding the small open cluster of stars (NGC 3324). Above the image center is the larger star cluster NGC 3293, while to its right is the relatively faint emission nebula designated Loden 153.  The most famous occupant of the Carina Nebula, however, is not shown. Off the image to the lower right is the bright, erratic, and doomed star star known as Eta Carinae -- a star once one of the brightest stars in the sky and now predicted to explode in a supernova sometime in the next few million years.","carina, nebula, great, home, strange, star, iconic, named, constellation, huge, star-forming, region, larger, brighter, orion, less, known, much, humanity, life, featured, image, show, detail, northern-most, part, visible, include, semi-circular, filament, surrounding, active, wr23, left, center, gabriela, mistral, consisting, emission, glowing, small, open, cluster, right, faint, designated, loden, famous, occupant, shown, bright, erratic, doomed, brightest, predicted, explode, supernova, next, year"
Moon Phases 2022,"What will the Moon phase be on your birthday this year?  It is hard to predict because the Moon's appearance changes nightly.  As the Moon orbits the Earth, the half illuminated by the Sun first becomes increasingly visible, then decreasingly visible. The featured video animates images and altitude data taken by NASA's Moon-orbiting Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter to show all 12 lunations that appear this year, 2022 -- as seen from Earth's northern (southern) hemisphere. A single lunation describes one full cycle of our Moon, including all of its phases. A full lunation takes about 29.5 days, just under a month (moon-th). As each lunation progresses, sunlight reflects from the Moon at different angles, and so illuminates different features differently.  During all of this, of course, the Moon always keeps the same face toward the Earth. What is less apparent night-to-night is that the Moon's apparent size changes slightly, and that a slight wobble called a libration occurs as the Moon progresses along its elliptical orbit.","moon, phase, birthday, year, predict, appearance, change, orbit, earth, half, illuminated, first, becomes, visible, featured, video, animates, image, altitude, data, taken, nasa, moon-orbiting, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, show, lunation, seen, northern, southern, single, describes, full, cycle, including, take, month, moon-th, progress, sunlight, reflects, different, angle, illuminates, feature, course, keep, face, apparent, night-to-night, size, slight, wobble, called, libration, occurs, elliptical"
The Galactic Center in Radio from MeerKAT,"What's happening at the center of our galaxy? It's hard to tell with optical telescopes since visible light is blocked by intervening interstellar dust. In other bands of light, though, such as radio, the galactic center can be imaged and shows itself to be quite an interesting and active place.  The featured picture shows the latest image of our Milky Way's center by the MeerKAT array of 64 radio dishes in South Africa. Spanning four times the angular size of the Moon (2 degrees), the image is impressively vast, deep, and detailed.  Many known sources are shown in clear detail, including many with a prefix of Sgr, since the galactic center is in the direction of the constellation Sagittarius.  In our Galaxy's Center lies Sgr A, found here in the image center, which houses the Milky Way's central supermassive black hole.  Other sources in the image are not as well understood, including the Arc, just to the left of Sgr A, and numerous filamentary threads.

Embraced by Sunlight,"ven though Venus (left) was the brightest planet in the sky it was less than 1/30th the apparent size of the Moon on January 29. But as both rose before the Sun they shared a crescent phase, and for a moment their visible disks were each about 12 percent illuminated as they stood above the southeastern horizon. The similar sunlit crescents were captured in these two separate images. Made at different magnifications, each panel is a composite of stacked video frames taken with a small telescope. Venus goes through a range of phases like the Moon as the inner planet wanders from evening sky to morning sky and back again with a period of 584 days. Of course the Moon completes its own cycle of phases, a full lunation, in about 29.5 days.","embraced, sunlight, venus, left, brightest, planet, 1/30th, apparent, size, moon, january, rose, shared, crescent, phase, moment, visible, disk, percent, illuminated, stood, southeastern, horizon, similar, sunlit, captured, separate, image, made, different, magnification, panel, composite, stacked, video, frame, taken, small, telescope, range, inner, wanders, evening, morning, period, course, completes, cycle, full, lunation"
Moons at Twilight,"ven though Jupiter was the only planet visible in the evening sky on February 2, it shared the twilight above the western horizon with the Solar System's brightest moons. In a single exposure made just after sunset, the Solar System's ruling gas giant is at the upper right in this telephoto field-of-view from Cancun, Mexico. The snapshot also captures our fair planet's own natural satellite in its young crescent phase. The Moon's disk looms large, its familiar face illuminated mostly by earthshine. But the four points of light lined-up with Jupiter are Jupiter's own large Galilean moons. Top to bottom are Ganymede, [Jupiter], Io, Europa, and Callisto. Ganymede, Io, and Callisto are physically larger than Earth's Moon while water world Europa is only slightly smaller.","moon, twilight, jupiter, planet, visible, evening, february, shared, western, horizon, solar, system, brightest, single, exposure, made, sunset, ruling, giant, upper, right, telephoto, field-of-view, cancun, mexico, snapshot, capture, fair, natural, satellite, young, crescent, phase, disk, loom, large, familiar, face, illuminated, earthshine, point, light, lined-up, galilean, bottom, ganymede, europa, callisto, larger, earth, water, world, smaller"
Symbiotic R Aquarii,"Variable star R Aquarii is actually an interacting binary star system, two stars that seem to have a close symbiotic relationship. Centered in this space-based optical/x-ray composite image it lies about 710 light years away. The intriguing system consists of a cool red giant star and hot, dense white dwarf star in mutual orbit around their common center of mass. With binoculars you can watch as R Aquarii steadily changes its brightness over the course of a year or so. The binary system's visible light is dominated by the red giant, itself a Mira-type long period variable star. But material in the cool giant star's extended envelope is pulled by gravity onto the surface of the smaller, denser white dwarf, eventually triggering a thermonuclear explosion, blasting material into space. Astronomers have seen such outbursts over recent decades. Evidence for much older outbursts is seen in these spectacular structures spanning almost a light-year as observed by the Hubble Space Telescope (in red and blue). Data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory (in purple) shows the X-ray glow from shock waves created as a jet from the white dwarf strikes surrounding material.","symbiotic, aquarii, variable, star, interacting, binary, system, seem, relationship, centered, space-based, optical/x-ray, composite, image, light, year, intriguing, consists, cool, giant, dense, white, dwarf, mutual, orbit, common, center, mass, binoculars, watch, change, brightness, course, visible, dominated, mira-type, long, period, material, extended, envelope, pulled, gravity, surface, smaller, denser, triggering, thermonuclear, explosion, blasting, space, astronomer, seen, outburst, recent, decade, evidence, much, older, spectacular, structure, spanning, light-year, observed, hubble, telescope, blue, data, chandra, x-ray, observatory, purple, show, glow, shock, wave, created, strike, surrounding"
Blue Marble Earth,"Welcome to planet Earth, the third planet from a star named the Sun.  The Earth is shaped like a sphere and composed mostly of rock.  Over 70 percent of the Earth's surface is water.  The planet has a relatively thin atmosphere composed mostly of nitrogen and oxygen.  The featured picture of Earth, dubbed The Blue Marble, was taken from Apollo 17 in 1972 and features Africa and Antarctica.  It is thought to be one of the most widely distributed photographs of any kind.  Earth has a single large Moon that is about 1/4 of its diameter and, from the planet's surface, is seen to have almost exactly the same angular size as the Sun.

NGC 4651: The Umbrella Galaxy,"It's raining stars.  What appears to be a giant cosmic umbrella is now known to be a tidal stream of stars stripped from a small satellite galaxy. The main galaxy, spiral galaxy NGC 4651, is about the size of our Milky Way, while its stellar parasol appears to extend some 100 thousand light-years above this galaxy's bright disk. A small galaxy was likely torn apart by repeated encounters as it swept back and forth on eccentric orbits through NGC 4651. The remaining stars will surely fall back and become part of a combined larger galaxy over the next few million years.

Aurora and Light Pillars over Norway,"Which half of this sky is your favorite? On the left, the night sky is lit up by particles expelled from the Sun that later collided with Earth's upper atmosphere — creating bright auroras.  On the right, the night glows with ground lights reflected by millions of tiny ice crystals falling from the sky — creating  light pillars.  And in the center, the astrophotographer presents your choices. The light pillars are vertical columns because the fluttering ice-crystals are mostly flat to the ground, and their colors are those of the ground lights. The auroras cover the sky and ground in the green hue of glowing oxygen, while their transparency is clear because you can see stars right through them. Distant stars dot the background, including bright stars from the iconic constellation of Orion.  The featured image was captured in a single exposure two months ago near Kautokeino, Norway.

Eta Car: 3D Model of the Most Dangerous Star Known,"What's the most dangerous star near earth?  Many believe it's Eta Carinae, a binary star system about 100 times the mass of the Sun, just 10,000 light years from earth.  Eta Carinae is a ticking time bomb, set to explode as a supernova in only a few million years, when it may bathe the earth in dangerous gamma rays.  The star suffered a notorious outburst in the 1840s when it became the brightest star in the southern sky, only to fade to obscurity within decades.  The star was not destroyed, but lies hidden behind a thick, expanding, double-lobed structure called the Homunculus which now surrounds the binary.  Studies of this ejecta provide forensic clues about the explosion.  Using observations from NASA satellites we can now visualize the 3D distribution of the shrapnel, all the way from the infrared, through optical and UV, to the outermost shell of million-degree material, visible only in X-rays.","model, dangerous, star, known, earth, many, believe, carina, binary, system, time, mass, light, year, ticking, bomb, explode, supernova, bathe, gamma, suffered, notorious, became, brightest, southern, fade, obscurity, decade, destroyed, hidden, thick, expanding, double-lobed, structure, called, homunculus, surround, study, ejecta, provide, forensic, clue, explosion, using, observation, satellite, visualize, distribution, shrapnel, infrared, optical, outermost, shell, million-degree, material, visible, x-ray"
T Tauri and Hind's Variable Nebula,"The star with an orange tint near top center in this dusty telescopic frame is T Tauri, prototype of the class of T Tauri variable stars.  Next to it (right) is a yellow cosmic cloud historically known as Hind's Variable Nebula (NGC 1555). About 650 light-years away, at the boundary of the local bubble and the Taurus molecular cloud, both star and nebula are seen to vary significantly in brightness but not necessarily at the same time, adding to the mystery of the intriguing region. T Tauri stars are now generally recognized as young (less than a few million years old), sun-like stars still in the early stages of formation. To further complicate the picture, infrared observations indicate that T Tauri itself is part of a multiple system and suggest that the associated Hind's Nebula may also contain a very young stellar object. The well-composed image spans about 8 light-years at the estimated distance of T Tauri.","tauri, hind, variable, nebula, star, orange, tint, center, dusty, telescopic, frame, prototype, class, next, yellow, cosmic, cloud, known, light-year, boundary, local, bubble, taurus, molecular, seen, vary, time, adding, mystery, intriguing, region, recognized, young, year, sun-like, early, stage, formation, complicate, picture, infrared, observation, indicate, part, multiple, system, suggest, associated, contain, stellar, object, well-composed, image, span, estimated, distance"
IC 342: The Hidden Galaxy in Camelopardalis,"Similar in size to large, bright spiral galaxies in our neighborhood, IC 342 is a mere 10 million light-years distant in the long-necked, northern constellation Camelopardalis. A sprawling island universe, IC 342 would otherwise be a prominent galaxy in our night sky, but it is hidden from clear view and only glimpsed through the veil of stars, gas and dust clouds along the plane of our own Milky Way galaxy. Even though IC 342's light is dimmed and reddened by intervening cosmic clouds, this sharp telescopic image traces the galaxy's own obscuring dust, young star clusters, and glowing pink star forming regions along spiral arms that wind far from the galaxy's core. IC 342 may have undergone a recent burst of star formation activity and is close enough to have gravitationally influenced the evolution of the local group of galaxies and the Milky Way.","hidden, galaxy, camelopardalis, similar, size, large, bright, spiral, neighborhood, light-year, distant, long-necked, northern, constellation, sprawling, island, universe, otherwise, prominent, night, clear, view, glimpsed, veil, star, dust, cloud, plane, milky, light, dimmed, reddened, intervening, cosmic, sharp, telescopic, image, trace, obscuring, young, cluster, glowing, pink, forming, region, wind, core, undergone, recent, burst, formation, activity, influenced, evolution, local, group"

Earth at Night,"This is what the Earth looks like at night.  Can you find your favorite country or city?  Surprisingly, city lights make this task quite possible.  Human-made lights highlight particularly developed or populated areas of the Earth's surface, including the seaboards of Europe, the eastern United States, and Japan.  Many large cities are located near rivers or oceans so that they can exchange goods cheaply by boat.  Particularly dark areas include the central parts of South America, Africa, Asia, and Australia.

In the Heart of the Heart Nebula,"What excites the Heart Nebula? First, the large emission nebula dubbed IC 1805 looks, in whole, like a human heart.  Its shape perhaps fitting of the Valentine's Day, this heart glows brightly in red light emitted by its most prominent element: excited hydrogen.  The red glow and the larger shape are all created by a small group of stars near the nebula's center.  In the heart of the Heart Nebula are young stars from the open star cluster Melotte 15 that are eroding away several picturesque dust pillars with their energetic light and winds. The open cluster of stars contains a few bright stars nearly 50 times the mass of our Sun, many dim stars only a fraction of the mass of our Sun, and an absent microquasar that was expelled millions of years ago.  The Heart Nebula is located about 7,500 light years away toward the constellation of the mythological Queen of Aethiopia (Cassiopeia).","heart, nebula, excites, large, emission, dubbed, look, whole, human, shape, fitting, valentine, glow, light, emitted, prominent, element, excited, hydrogen, larger, created, small, group, star, center, young, open, cluster, melotte, eroding, several, picturesque, dust, pillar, energetic, wind, contains, bright, time, mass, many, fraction, absent, microquasar, expelled, year, located, constellation, mythological, queen, aethiopia, cassiopeia"
Terminator Moon,"What's different about this Moon? It's the terminators. In the featured image, you can't directly see any terminator -- the line that divides the light of day from the dark of night. That's because the image is a digital composite of 29 near-terminator lunar strips.  Terminator regions show the longest and most prominent shadows -- shadows which, by their contrast and length, allow a flat photograph to appear three-dimensional. The original images and data were taken near the Moon by NASA's Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter.  Many of the Moon's craters stand out because of the shadows they all cast to the right. The image shows in graphic detail that the darker regions known as maria are not just darker than the rest of the Moon -- they are flatter.

Eiffel Tower Prominence on the Sun,"What's that on the Sun? Although it may look like a flowing version of the Eiffel Tower, it is a solar prominence that is actually much bigger -- about the height of Jupiter. The huge prominence emerged about ten days ago, hovered over the Sun's surface for about two days, and then erupted -- throwing a coronal mass ejection (CME) into the Solar System. The featured video, captured from the astrophotographer's backyard in Hendersonville, Tennessee, USA, shows an hour time-lapse played both forwards and backwards. That CME did not impact the Earth, but our Sun had unleashed  other recent CMEs that not only triggered Earthly auroras, but puffed out the Earth's atmosphere enough to cause just-launched Starlink satellites to fall back. Activity on the Sun, including sunspots, prominences, CMEs and flares, continues to increase as the Sun evolves away from a deep minimum in its 11-year magnetic cycle.

Chamaeleon I Molecular Cloud,"Dark markings and bright nebulae in this telescopic southern sky view are telltale signs of young stars and active star formation. They lie a mere 650 light-years away, at the boundary of the local bubble and the Chamaeleon molecular cloud complex. Regions with young stars identified as dusty reflection nebulae from the 1946 Cederblad catalog include the C-shaped Ced 110 just above and left of center, and bluish Ced 111 below it. Also a standout in the frame, the orange tinted V-shape of the Chamaeleon Infrared Nebula (Cha IRN) was carved by material streaming from a newly formed low-mass star.  The well-composed image spans 1.5 degrees. That's about 17 light-years at the estimated distance of the nearby Chamaeleon I molecular cloud.","chamaeleon, molecular, cloud, dark, marking, bright, nebula, telescopic, southern, view, telltale, sign, young, star, active, formation, light-year, boundary, local, bubble, complex, region, identified, dusty, reflection, cederblad, catalog, include, c-shaped, left, center, bluish, standout, frame, orange, tinted, v-shape, infrared, carved, material, streaming, formed, low-mass, well-composed, image, span, degree, estimated, distance, nearby"
Three Clusters in Puppis,"Galactic or open star clusters are young. The swarms of stars are born together near the plane of the Milky Way, but their numbers steadily dwindle as cluster members are ejected by galactic tides and gravitational interactions. Caught in this telescopic frame over three degrees across are three good examples of galactic star clusters, seen toward the southern sky's nautical constellation Puppis. Below and left, M46 is some 5,500 light-years in the distance. Right of center M47 is only 1,600 light-years away and NGC 2423 (top) is about 2500 light-years distant. Around 300 million years young M46 contains a few hundred stars in a region about 30 light-years across. Sharp eyes can spot a planetary nebula, NGC 2438, at about 11 o'clock against the M46 cluster stars. But that nebula's central star is billions of years old, and NGC 2438 is likely a foreground object only by chance along the line of sight to youthful M46. Even younger, aged around 80 million years, M47 is a smaller and looser star cluster spanning about 10 light-years. Star cluster NGC 2423 is pushing about 750 million years in age though. NGC 2423 is known to harbor an extrasolar planet, detected orbiting one of its red giant stars.","cluster, galactic, open, star, young, swarm, born, plane, milky, number, dwindle, member, ejected, gravitational, interaction, caught, telescopic, frame, degree, good, example, seen, southern, nautical, constellation, puppis, left, light-year, distance, center, distant, year, contains, hundred, region, sharp, spot, planetary, nebula, o'clock, central, likely, foreground, object, chance, line, sight, youthful, younger, aged, smaller, looser, spanning, pushing, known, harbor, extrasolar, planet, detected, orbiting, giant"
Peculiar Galaxies of Arp 273,"The spiky stars in the foreground of this backyard telescopic frame are well within our own Milky Way Galaxy. But the two eye-catching galaxies lie far beyond the Milky Way, at a distance of over 300 million light-years. Their distorted appearance is due to gravitational tides as the pair engage in close encounters. Cataloged as Arp 273 (also as UGC 1810), the galaxies do look peculiar, but interacting galaxies are now understood to be common in the universe. Nearby, the large spiral Andromeda Galaxy is known to be some 2 million light-years away and approaching the Milky Way. The peculiar galaxies of Arp 273 may offer an analog of their far future encounter. Repeated galaxy encounters on a cosmic timescale can ultimately result in a merger into a single galaxy of stars. From our perspective, the bright cores of the Arp 273 galaxies are separated by only a little over 100,000 light-years.","peculiar, galaxy, spiky, star, foreground, telescopic, frame, milky, eye-catching, distance, light-year, distorted, appearance, gravitational, tide, pair, engage, close, encounter, cataloged, look, interacting, understood, common, universe, nearby, large, spiral, andromeda, known, approaching, offer, analog, future, repeated, cosmic, timescale, result, merger, single, perspective, bright, core, separated, little"
Aurora Over White Dome Geyser,"Sometimes both heaven and Earth erupt. Colorful auroras erupted unexpectedly a few years ago, with green aurora appearing near the horizon and brilliant bands of red aurora blooming high overhead.  A bright Moon lit the foreground of this picturesque scene, while familiar stars could be seen far in the distance.  With planning, the careful astrophotographer shot this image mosaic in the field of White Dome Geyser in Yellowstone National Park in the western USA. Sure enough, just after midnight, White Dome erupted -- spraying a stream of water and vapor many meters into the air. Geyser water is heated to steam by scalding magma several kilometers below, and rises through rock cracks to the surface. About half of all known geysers occur in Yellowstone National Park. Although the geomagnetic storm that caused the auroras subsided within a day, eruptions of White Dome Geyser continue about every 30 minutes.","aurora, white, dome, geyser, earth, erupt, colorful, erupted, unexpectedly, year, green, appearing, horizon, brilliant, band, blooming, high, overhead, bright, moon, foreground, picturesque, scene, familiar, star, seen, distance, planning, careful, shot, image, mosaic, field, national, park, western, sure, midnight, spraying, stream, water, vapor, many, heated, steam, scalding, magma, several, kilometer, rise, rock, crack, surface, half, known, geomagnetic, storm, caused, subsided, eruption, continue, minute"
Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 6217,"Many spiral galaxies have bars across their centers.  Even our own Milky Way Galaxy is thought to have a modest central bar. Prominently barred spiral galaxy NGC 6217, featured here, was captured in spectacular detail in this image taken by the Advanced Camera for Surveys on the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope in 2009. Visible are dark filamentary dust lanes, young clusters of bright blue stars, red emission nebulas of glowing hydrogen gas, a long bar of stars across the center, and a bright active nucleus that likely houses a supermassive black hole.  Light takes about 60 million years to reach us from NGC 6217, which spans about 30,000 light years across and can be found toward the constellation of the Little Bear (Ursa Minor).

Illustration: An Early Quasar,"What did the first quasars look like?  The nearest quasars are now known to involve supermassive black holes in the centers of active galaxies.  Gas and dust that falls toward a quasar glows brightly, sometimes outglowing the entire home galaxy.  The quasars that formed in the first billion years of the universe are more mysterious, though. Featured, recent data has enabled an artist's impression of an early-universe quasar as it might have been: centered on a massive black hole, surrounded by sheets of gas and an accretion disk, and expelling a powerful jet. Quasars are among the most distant objects we see and give humanity unique information about the early and intervening universe. The oldest quasars currently known are seen at just short of redshift 8 -- only 700 million years after the Big Bang -- when the universe was only a few percent of its current age.","illustration, quasar, first, look, nearest, known, involve, supermassive, black, hole, center, active, galaxy, dust, fall, glow, outglowing, entire, home, formed, year, mysterious, featured, recent, data, enabled, artist, impression, early-universe, centered, massive, surrounded, sheet, accretion, disk, expelling, powerful, distant, object, give, humanity, unique, information, intervening, universe, oldest, seen, short, redshift, bang, percent, current"
Orion over Green Bank,"What will the huge Green Bank Telescope discover tonight? Pictured, the Robert C. Byrd Green Bank Telescope (GBT) on the lower right is the largest fully-pointable single-dish radio telescope in the world. With a central dish larger than a football field, the GBT is nestled in the hills of West Virginia, USA in a radio quiet zone where the use of cell phones, WiFi emitters, and even microwave ovens are limited. The GBT explores our universe not only during the night -- but during the day, too, since the daytime sky is typically dark in radio waves.  Taken in late January, the featured image was planned for months to get the setting location of Orion just right.  The image is a composite of a foreground shot taken over a kilometer away from the GBT, and a background shot built up of long exposures during the previous night. The deep background image of Orion is fitting because the GBT is famous for, among many discoveries, mapping the unusual magnetic field in the Orion Molecular Cloud Complex.","orion, green, bank, huge, telescope, discover, tonight, pictured, robert, byrd, lower, largest, fully-pointable, single-dish, radio, world, central, dish, larger, football, field, nestled, hill, west, virginia, quiet, zone, cell, phone, wifi, microwave, limited, explores, universe, night, daytime, dark, wave, taken, late, january, featured, image, planned, month, setting, location, composite, foreground, shot, background, built, previous, deep, fitting, famous, many, discovery, mapping, unusual, magnetic, molecular, cloud, complex"
Beautiful Albireo AB,"Beta Cygni is a single bright star to the naked eye. About 420 light-years away it marks the foot of the Northern Cross, famous asterism in the constellation Cygnus. But a view through the eyepiece of a small telescope will transform it into a beautiful double star, a treasure of the night sky in blue and gold. Beta Cygni is also known as Albireo, designated Albireo AB to indicate its two bright component stars. Their visually striking color difference is illustrated in this telescopic snapshot, along with their associated visible spectrum of starlight shown in insets to the right. Albireo A, top inset, shows the spectrum of a K-type giant star, cooler than the Sun and emitting most of its energy at yellow and red wavelengths. Below, Albireo B has the spectrum of a main sequence star much hotter than the Sun, emitting more energy in blue and violet. Albireo A is known to be a binary star, two stars together orbiting a common center of mass, though the two stars are too close together to be seen separately with a small telescope. Well-separated Albireo A and B most likely represent an optical double star and not a physical binary system because the two components have clearly different measured motions through space.","beautiful, albireo, beta, cygni, single, bright, star, naked, light-year, mark, foot, northern, cross, famous, asterism, constellation, cygnus, view, eyepiece, small, telescope, transform, double, treasure, night, blue, gold, known, designated, indicate, component, striking, color, difference, illustrated, telescopic, snapshot, associated, visible, spectrum, starlight, shown, right, inset, show, k-type, giant, cooler, emitting, energy, yellow, wavelength, main, sequence, much, hotter, violet, binary, orbiting, common, center, mass, seen, well-separated, likely, represent, optical, physical, system, different, measured, motion, space"
Perseverance Sol 354,"This Navcam mosaic from Perseverance looks out over the car-sized rover's deck, across the floor of Jezero crater on Mars. Frames used to construct the mosaic view were captured on mission sol 354. That corresponds to Earth calendar date February 17, 2022, nearly one Earth year after the rover's landing. With a mass of over 1,000 kilograms, six-wheeled Perseverance is the heaviest rover to touch down on Mars. During its first year of exploration the rover has collected six (so far) rock core samples for later return to planet Earth, served as the base station for Ingenuity, the first helicopter on Mars, and tested MOXIE (Mars Oxygen In-Situ Resource Utilization Experiment), converting some of the Red Planet’s thin, carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere into oxygen.","perseverance, navcam, mosaic, look, car-sized, rover, deck, floor, jezero, crater, frame, used, construct, view, captured, mission, corresponds, earth, calendar, date, february, year, landing, mass, kilogram, six-wheeled, heaviest, touch, first, exploration, collected, rock, core, sample, return, planet, served, base, station, ingenuity, helicopter, tested, moxie, oxygen, in-situ, resource, utilization, experiment, converting, thin, carbon, dioxide-rich, atmosphere"
Nearby Spiral Galaxy NGC 4945,"Large spiral galaxy NGC 4945 is seen nearly edge-on in this cosmic galaxy close-up. It's almost the size of our Milky Way Galaxy. NGC 4945's own dusty disk, young blue star clusters, and pink star forming regions stand out in the colorful telescopic frame. About 13 million light-years distant toward the expansive southern constellation Centaurus, NGC 4945 is only about six times farther away than Andromeda, the nearest large spiral galaxy to the Milky Way. Though this galaxy's central region is largely hidden from view for optical telescopes, X-ray and infrared observations indicate significant high energy emission and star formation in the core of NGC 4945.

Earthrise 1: Historic Image Remastered,"""Oh my God! Look at that picture over there! Here's the Earth coming up. Wow is that pretty!"" Soon after that pronouncement, about 53 years ago, one of the most famous images ever taken was snapped from the orbit of the Moon. Now known as ""Earthrise"", the iconic image shows the Earth rising above the limb of the Moon, as taken by the crew of Apollo 8.  But the well-known Earthrise image was actually the  second image taken of the Earth rising above the lunar limb -- it was just the first in color.  With modern digital technology, however, the real first Earthrise image -- originally in black and white -- has now been remastered to have the combined resolution and color of the first three images.  Behold! The featured image is a close-up of the picture that Apollo 8 astronaut Bill Anders was talking about. Thanks to modern technology and human ingenuity, now we can all see it.

Direct Projection: The Moon in My Hands,"You don't have to look through a telescope to know where it's pointing. Allowing the telescope to project its image onto a large surface can be useful because it dilutes the intense brightness of very bright sources. Such dilution is useful for looking at the Sun, for example during a solar eclipse. In the featured single-exposure image, though, it is a too-bright full moon that is projected. This February full moon occurred two weeks ago and is called the Snow Moon by some northern cultures.  The projecting instrument is the main 62-centimeter telescope at the Saint-Véran Observatory high in the French Alps. Seeing a full moon directly is easier because it is not too bright, although you won't see this level of detail.  Your next chance will occur on March 17.","direct, projection, moon, hand, look, telescope, know, pointing, allowing, project, image, large, surface, useful, dilutes, intense, brightness, bright, source, dilution, looking, example, solar, eclipse, featured, single-exposure, too-bright, full, projected, february, occurred, week, called, snow, northern, culture, projecting, instrument, main, 62-centimeter, saint-véran, observatory, high, french, seeing, level, detail, next, chance"
Dueling Bands in the Night,"What are these two bands in the sky? The more commonly seen band is the one on the right and is the central band of our Milky Way galaxy. Our Sun orbits in the disk of this spiral galaxy, so that from inside, this disk appears as a band of comparable brightness all the way around the sky. The Milky Way band can also be seen all year -- if out away from city lights.  The less commonly seem band, on the left, is zodiacal light -- sunlight reflected from dust orbiting the Sun in our Solar System.  Zodiacal light is brightest near the Sun and so is best seen just before sunrise or just after sunset.  On some evenings in the north, particularly during the months of March and April, this ribbon of zodiacal light can appear quite prominent after sunset.  It was determined only this century that zodiacal dust was mostly expelled by comets that have passed near Jupiter.  Only on certain times of the year will the two bands be seen side by side, in parts of the sky, like this.  The featured image, including the Andromeda galaxy and a meteor, was captured in late January over a frozen lake in Kanding, Sichuan, China.","dueling, band, night, seen, right, central, milky, galaxy, orbit, disk, spiral, appears, comparable, brightness, year, city, light, less, seem, left, zodiacal, sunlight, reflected, dust, orbiting, solar, system, brightest, best, sunrise, sunset, evening, north, month, march, april, ribbon, appear, prominent, determined, century, expelled, comet, passed, jupiter, certain, time, side, part, featured, image, including, andromeda, meteor, captured, late, january, frozen, lake, kanding, sichuan, china"
Record Prominence Imaged by Solar Orbiter,"What's happened to our Sun?  Last month, it produced the largest prominence ever imaged together with a complete solar disk. The record image, featured, was captured in ultraviolet light by the Sun-orbiting Solar Orbiter spacecraft. A quiescent solar prominence is a cloud of hot gas held above the Sun's surface by the Sun's magnetic field.  This solar prominence was huge -- spanning a length rivaling the diameter of the Sun itself. Solar prominences may erupt unpredictably and expel hot gas into the Solar System via a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME).  When a CME strikes the Earth and its magnetosphere, bright auroras may occur. This prominence did produce a CME, but it was directed well away from the Earth. Although surely related to the Sun's changing magnetic field, the energy mechanism that creates and sustains a solar prominence remains a topic of research.","record, prominence, imaged, solar, orbiter, happened, last, month, produced, largest, complete, disk, image, featured, captured, ultraviolet, light, sun-orbiting, spacecraft, quiescent, cloud, held, surface, magnetic, field, huge, spanning, length, rivaling, diameter, erupt, expel, system, coronal, mass, ejection, strike, earth, bright, aurora, occur, produce, directed, related, changing, energy, mechanism, creates, sustains, remains, topic, research"
Spiral Galaxy NGC 2841,"A mere 46 million light-years distant, spiral galaxy NGC 2841 can be found in the northern constellation of Ursa Major. This deep view of the gorgeous island universe was captured during 32 clear nights in November, December 2021 and January 2022. It shows off a striking yellow nucleus, galactic disk, and faint outer regions.  Dust lanes, small star-forming regions, and young star clusters are embedded in the patchy, tightly wound spiral arms. In contrast, many other spirals exhibit grand, sweeping arms with large star-forming regions.  NGC 2841 has a diameter of over 150,000 light-years, even larger than our own Milky Way. X-ray images suggest that resulting winds and stellar explosions create plumes of hot gas extending into a halo around NGC 2841.","spiral, galaxy, light-year, distant, found, northern, constellation, major, deep, view, gorgeous, island, universe, captured, clear, night, december, january, show, striking, yellow, nucleus, galactic, disk, faint, outer, region, dust, lane, small, star-forming, young, star, cluster, embedded, patchy, contrast, many, exhibit, grand, sweeping, large, diameter, larger, milky, x-ray, image, suggest, resulting, stellar, explosion, create, plume, extending, halo"
The Multiwavelength Crab,"The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first object on Charles Messier's famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab is now known to be a supernova remnant, expanding debris from massive star's death explosion, witnessed on planet Earth in 1054 AD. This brave new image offers a 21st century view of the Crab Nebula by presenting image data from across the electromagnetic spectrum as wavelengths of visible light. From space, Chandra (X-ray) XMM-Newton (ultraviolet), Hubble (visible), and Spitzer (infrared), data are in purple, blue, green, and yellow hues. From the ground, Very Large Array radio wavelength data is shown in red. One of the most exotic objects known to modern astronomers, the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star spinning 30 times a second, is the bright spot near picture center. Like a cosmic dynamo, this collapsed remnant of the stellar core powers the Crab's emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Spanning about 12 light-years, the Crab Nebula is 6,500 light-years away in the constellation Taurus.","multiwavelength, crab, nebula, cataloged, first, object, charles, messier, famous, list, thing, comet, fact, known, supernova, remnant, expanding, debris, massive, star, death, explosion, witnessed, planet, earth, brave, image, offer, 21st, century, view, presenting, data, electromagnetic, spectrum, wavelength, visible, light, space, chandra, x-ray, xmm-newton, ultraviolet, hubble, spitzer, infrared, purple, blue, green, yellow, ground, large, array, radio, shown, exotic, modern, astronomer, pulsar, neutron, spinning, time, second, bright, spot, picture, center, cosmic, dynamo, collapsed, stellar, core, power, emission, spanning, light-year, constellation, taurus"
Interstellar Comet 2I Borisov,"From somewhere else in the Milky Way galaxy, Comet 2I/Borisov was just visiting the Solar System. Discovered by amateur astronomer Gennady Borisov on August 30, 2019, the first known interstellar comet is seen in these two Hubble Space Telescope images from November and December 2019. On the left, a distant background galaxy near the line-of-sight to Borisov is blurred as Hubble tracked the speeding comet and dust tail about 327 million kilometers from Earth. At right, 2I/Borisov appears shortly after perihelion, its closest approach to Sun. European Southern Observatory observations indicate that this comet may never have passed close to any star before its 2019 perihelion passage. Borisov's closest approach to our fair planet, a distance of about 290 million kilometers, came on December 28, 2019. Even though Hubble's sharp images don't resolve the comet's nucleus, they did lead to estimates of less than 1 kilometer for its diameter.","interstellar, comet, borisov, milky, galaxy, visiting, solar, system, discovered, amateur, astronomer, gennady, first, known, seen, hubble, space, telescope, image, november, december, left, distant, background, line-of-sight, blurred, tracked, speeding, dust, tail, kilometer, earth, appears, perihelion, closest, approach, european, southern, observatory, observation, indicate, passed, star, passage, fair, planet, distance, came, sharp, resolve, nucleus, lead, estimate, diameter"
Venus and the Triply Ultraviolet Sun,"This was a very unusual type of solar eclipse.  Typically, it is the Earth's Moon that eclipses the Sun.  In 2012, though, the planet Venus took a turn.  Like a solar eclipse by the Moon, the phase of Venus became a continually thinner crescent as Venus became increasingly better aligned with the Sun.  Eventually the alignment became perfect and the phase of Venus dropped to zero.  The dark spot of Venus crossed our parent star.  The situation could technically be labeled a Venusian annular eclipse with an extraordinarily large ring of fire.  Pictured here during the occultation, the Sun was imaged in three colors of ultraviolet light by the Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, with the dark region toward the right corresponding to a coronal hole. Hours later, as Venus continued in its orbit, a slight crescent phase appeared again.  The next Venusian transit across the Sun will occur in 2117.","venus, triply, ultraviolet, unusual, type, solar, eclipse, earth, moon, planet, took, turn, phase, became, thinner, crescent, aligned, alignment, perfect, dropped, dark, spot, crossed, parent, star, situation, labeled, venusian, annular, large, ring, fire, pictured, occultation, imaged, color, light, earth-orbiting, dynamic, observatory, region, right, corresponding, coronal, hole, hour, continued, slight, appeared, next, transit, occur"
A Lion in Orion,"Yes, but can you see the lion? A deep exposure shows the famous dark indentation that looks like a horse's head, visible just left and below center, and known unsurprisingly as the Horsehead Nebula.  The Horsehead Nebula (Barnard 33) is part of a vast complex of dark absorbing dust and bright glowing gas.  To bring out details of the  Horsehead's pasture, an astrophotographer artistically combined light accumulated for over 20 hours in hydrogen (orange), oxygen (blue), and sulfur (green). The resulting spectacular picture captured from Raachine, Lebanon, details an intricate tapestry of gaseous wisps and dust-laden filaments that were created and sculpted over eons by stellar winds and ancient supernovas.  The featured composition brings up another pareidolic animal icon -- that of a lion's head -- in the expansive orange colored gas above the horse's head.

Moon in Inverted Colors,"Which moon is this? It's Earth's moon -- but in inverted colors. Here, the pixel values corresponding to light and dark areas have been translated in reverse, or inverted, producing a false-color representation reminiscent of a black and white photographic negative.  However, this is an inverted color image -- where the muted colors of the moon are real but digitally exaggerated before inversion.  Normally bright rays from the large crater Tycho dominate the southern (bottom) features as easily followed dark green lines emanating from the 85-kilometer diameter impact site.  Normally dark lunar mare appear light and silvery.  The image was acquired in Southend-on-Sea, England, UK.  Historically, astronomical images recorded on photographic plates were directly examined on inverted-color negatives because it helped the eye pick out faint details.","moon, inverted, color, earth, pixel, value, corresponding, light, dark, area, translated, reverse, producing, false-color, representation, reminiscent, black, white, photographic, negative, image, muted, real, exaggerated, inversion, bright, large, crater, tycho, dominate, southern, bottom, feature, followed, green, line, emanating, 85-kilometer, diameter, impact, site, lunar, mare, appear, silvery, acquired, southend-on-sea, england, astronomical, recorded, plate, examined, inverted-color, helped, pick, faint, detail"
A Flower-Shaped Rock on Mars,"It is one of the more unusual rocks yet found on Mars. Smaller than a penny, the rock has several appendages that make it look, to some, like a flower. Although it would be a major discovery if the rock was truly a fossilized ancient Martian flower, there are less spectacular -- and currently preferred -- explanations for its unusual structure.  One theory that has emerged is that the rock is a type of concretion created by minerals deposited by water in cracks or divisions in existing rock. These concretions can be compacted together, can be harder and denser than surrounding rock, and can remain even after the surrounding rock erodes away.  The flower structure may also be caused by crystal clusters. The small rock, named Blackthorn Salt, has similarities to previously imaged Martian pebbles. The featured image was taken by the Curiosity rover on Mars in late February.  Scientists will continue to study data and images taken of this -- and similar -- surprising Martian rocks.

Globular Star Cluster 47 Tuc,"Globular star cluster 47 Tucanae is a jewel of the southern sky. Also known as NGC 104, it roams the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy along with some 200 other globular star clusters. The second brightest globular cluster (after Omega Centauri) as seen from planet Earth, 47 Tuc lies about 13,000 light-years away. It can be spotted with the naked-eye close on the sky to the Small Magellanic Cloud in the constellation of the Toucan. The dense cluster is made up of hundreds of thousands of stars in a volume only about 120 light-years across. Red giant stars on the outskirts of the cluster are easy to pick out as yellowish stars in this sharp telescopic portrait. Tightly packed globular cluster 47 Tuc is also home to a star with the closest known orbit around a black hole.","globular, star, cluster, tucanae, jewel, southern, known, roams, halo, milky, galaxy, second, brightest, omega, centauri, seen, planet, earth, light-year, spotted, naked-eye, close, small, magellanic, cloud, constellation, toucan, dense, made, thousand, volume, giant, outskirt, easy, pick, yellowish, sharp, telescopic, portrait, packed, home, closest, orbit, black, hole"
When Rainbows Smile,"Want to see a rainbow smile? Look near the zenith (straight up) when the sun is low in the sky and you might. This example of an ice halo known as a circumzenithal arc was captured above a palm tree top from Ragusa, Sicily on February 24. The vividly colorful arcs are often called smiling rainbows because of their upside down curvature and colors. For circumzenithal arcs the zenith is at the center and red is on the outside, compared to rainbows whose arcs bend toward the horizon after a downpour. True rainbows are formed by water droplets refracting the sunlight to produce a spectrum of colors, though. Circumzenithal arcs are the product of refraction and reflection in flat hexagonal ice crystals, like the ice crystals that create sundogs, formed in high thin clouds.","rainbow, smile, want, look, zenith, straight, example, halo, known, circumzenithal, captured, palm, tree, ragusa, february, colorful, called, smiling, upside, curvature, color, center, outside, compared, bend, horizon, downpour, true, formed, water, droplet, refracting, sunlight, produce, spectrum, product, refraction, reflection, flat, hexagonal, crystal, create, sundog, high, thin, cloud"
Point Reyes Milky Way,"Northern winter constellations and a long arc of the Milky Way are setting in this night skyscape looking toward the Pacific Ocean from Point Reyes on planet Earth's California coast. Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major, is prominent below the starry arc toward the left. Orion's yellowish Betelgeuse, Aldebaran in Taurus, and the blue tinted Pleiades star cluster also find themselves between Milky Way and northwestern horizon near the center of the scene. The nebulae visible in the series of exposures used to construct this panoramic view were captured in early March, but are just too faint to be seen with the unaided eye. On that northern night their expansive glow includes the reddish semi-circle of Barnard's Loop in Orion and NGC 1499 above and right of the Pleiades, also known as the California Nebula.","point, reyes, milky, northern, winter, constellation, setting, night, skyscape, looking, pacific, ocean, planet, earth, california, coast, sirius, alpha, star, canis, major, prominent, starry, left, orion, yellowish, betelgeuse, aldebaran, taurus, blue, tinted, pleiades, cluster, find, northwestern, horizon, center, scene, nebula, visible, series, exposure, used, construct, panoramic, view, captured, early, march, faint, seen, unaided, expansive, glow, includes, reddish, semi-circle, barnard, loop, right, known"
Colorful Airglow Bands Surround Milky Way,"Why would the sky glow like a giant repeating rainbow?  Airglow.  Now air glows all of the time, but it is usually hard to see. A disturbance however -- like an approaching storm -- may cause noticeable rippling in the Earth's atmosphere. These gravity waves are oscillations in air analogous to those created when a rock is thrown in calm water.  Red airglow likely originates from OH molecules about 87-kilometers high, excited by ultraviolet light from the Sun, while orange and green airglow is likely caused by sodium and oxygen atoms slightly higher up.  While driving near Keluke Lake in Qinghai Provence in China a few years ago, the photographer originally noticed mainly the impressive central band of the Milky Way Galaxy.  Stopping to photograph it, surprisingly, the resulting sensitive camera image showed airglow bands to be quite prominent and span the entire sky. The featured image has been digitally enhanced to make the colors more vibrant.","colorful, airglow, band, surround, milky, glow, giant, repeating, rainbow, time, hard, disturbance, approaching, storm, cause, noticeable, rippling, earth, atmosphere, gravity, wave, oscillation, analogous, created, rock, thrown, calm, water, originates, molecule, 87-kilometers, high, excited, ultraviolet, light, orange, green, caused, sodium, oxygen, atom, higher, driving, keluke, lake, qinghai, provence, year, noticed, impressive, central, galaxy, stopping, photograph, resulting, sensitive, camera, image, showed, prominent, span, entire, featured, enhanced, make, color, vibrant"
Star Formation in the Eagle Nebula,"Where do stars form?  One place, star forming regions known as ""EGGs"", are being uncovered at the end of this giant pillar of gas and dust in the Eagle Nebula (M16).  Short for evaporating gaseous globules, EGGs are dense regions of mostly molecular hydrogen gas that fragment and gravitationally collapse to form stars.  Light from the hottest and brightest of these new stars heats the end of the pillar and causes further evaporation of gas and dust -- revealing yet more EGGs and more young stars.  This featured picture was created from exposures spanning over 30 hours with the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope in 2014, and digitally processed with modern software by experienced volunteers in Argentina. Newborn stars will gradually destroy their birth pillars over the next 100,000 years or so -- if a supernova doesn't destroy them first.","star, formation, eagle, nebula, form, place, forming, region, known, uncovered, giant, pillar, dust, short, evaporating, gaseous, globule, dense, molecular, hydrogen, fragment, collapse, light, hottest, brightest, heat, cause, evaporation, revealing, young, featured, picture, created, exposure, spanning, hour, earth-orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, processed, modern, software, experienced, volunteer, argentina, newborn, destroy, birth, next, year, supernova"
A Road to the Stars,"Pictured -- a very scenic road to the stars.  The road approaches La Silla Observatory in Chile, with the ESO's 3.6-meter telescope just up ahead. To the left are some futuristic-looking support structures for the planned BlackGEM telescopes, an array of optical telescopes that will help locate optical counterparts to gravitational waves detections by LIGO and other detectors.  But there is much more. Red airglow illuminates the night sky on the right, while the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy slants across the image center. Jupiter can be seen just above the band near the image center, while Saturn is visible just above the 3.6-meter telescope dome. The two largest satellite galaxies of our Milky Way Galaxy, the LMC and SMC, are seen on the far right. The featured image panorama was built up from multiple 15-second exposures that were captured on 2019 June 30.  Two days later, La Silla experienced a rare total eclipse of the Sun.","road, star, pictured, scenic, approach, silla, observatory, chile, 3.6-meter, telescope, left, futuristic-looking, support, structure, planned, array, optical, help, locate, counterpart, gravitational, wave, detection, ligo, detector, much, airglow, illuminates, night, right, central, band, milky, galaxy, slant, image, center, jupiter, seen, saturn, visible, dome, largest, satellite, featured, panorama, built, multiple, 15-second, exposure, captured, june, experienced, rare, total, eclipse"
The Observable Universe,"How far can you see? Everything you can see, and everything you could possibly see, right now, assuming your eyes could detect all types of radiations around you -- is the observable universe.  In light, the farthest we can see comes from the cosmic microwave background, a time 13.8 billion years ago when the universe was opaque like thick fog. Some neutrinos and gravitational waves that surround us come from even farther out, but humanity does not yet have the technology to detect them. The featured image illustrates the observable universe on an increasingly compact scale, with the Earth and Sun at the center surrounded by our Solar System, nearby stars, nearby galaxies, distant galaxies, filaments of early matter, and the cosmic microwave background. Cosmologists typically assume that our observable universe is just the nearby part of a greater entity known as ""the universe"" where the same physics applies.  However, there are several lines of popular but speculative reasoning that assert that even our universe is part of a greater multiverse where either different physical constants occur, different physical laws apply, higher dimensions operate, or slightly different-by-chance versions of our standard universe exist.

Centaurus A,"A mere 11 million light-years away, Centaurus A is the closest active galaxy to planet Earth. Spanning over 60,000 light-years, the peculiar elliptical galaxy also known as NGC 5128, is featured in this sharp telescopic view. Centaurus A is apparently the result of a collision of two otherwise normal galaxies resulting in a fantastic jumble of star clusters and imposing dark dust lanes. Near the galaxy's center, leftover cosmic debris is steadily being consumed by a central black hole with a billion times the mass of the Sun. As in other active galaxies, that process likely generates the enormous radio, X-ray, and gamma-ray energy radiated by Centaurus A.","centaurus, light-year, closest, active, galaxy, planet, earth, spanning, peculiar, elliptical, known, featured, sharp, telescopic, view, result, collision, normal, resulting, fantastic, jumble, star, cluster, imposing, dark, dust, lane, center, cosmic, debris, consumed, central, black, hole, time, mass, process, likely, generates, enormous, radio, x-ray, gamma-ray, energy, radiated"
A Filament in Monoceros,"Bluish reflection nebulae seem to fill this dusty expanse. The sharp telescopic frame spans over 1 degree on the sky toward the faint but fanciful constellation Monoceros, the Unicorn. Seen within the Monoceros R1 cloud complex some 2,500 light-years away, bluish IC 447 is on the left, joined by a long dark filament of dust to IC 446 at lower right. Embedded in IC 447 are young, massive blue stars much hotter than the Sun, whose light is reflected by the cosmic cloud of star stuff. Observations reveal that IC 446 also contains a young stellar object, a massive star still in an early stage of evolution.

2MASS J17554042+6551277,"2MASS J17554042+6551277 doesn't exactly roll off the tongue but that's the name, a coordinate-based catalog designation, of the star centered in this sharp field of view. Fans of the distant universe should get used to its spiky appearance though. The diffraction pattern is created by the 18 hexagonal mirror segments of the James Webb Space Telescope. After unfolding, the segments have now been adjusted to achieve a diffraction limited alignment at infrared wavelengths while operating in concert as a single 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror. The resulting image taken by Webb's NIRcam demonstrates their precise alignment is the best physics will allow. 2MASS J17554042+6551277 is about 2,000 light-years away and well within our own galaxy. But the galaxies scattered across the background of the Webb telescope alignment evaluation image are likely billions of light-years distant, far beyond the Milky Way.","j17554042+6551277, roll, tongue, name, coordinate-based, catalog, designation, star, centered, sharp, field, view, distant, universe, used, spiky, appearance, diffraction, pattern, created, hexagonal, mirror, segment, james, webb, space, telescope, unfolding, adjusted, achieve, limited, alignment, infrared, wavelength, operating, concert, single, meter, diameter, primary, resulting, image, taken, nircam, demonstrates, precise, best, physic, allow, light-year, galaxy, scattered, background, evaluation, likely, milky"
A Picturesque Equinox Sunset,"What's that at the end of the road? The Sun. Many towns have roads that run east - west, and on two days each year, the Sun rises and sets right down the middle. Today is one of those days: an equinox. Not only is today a day of equal night (""aequus""-""nox"") and day time, but also a day when the sun rises precisely to the east and sets due west. Featured here is a picturesque road in northwest Illinois, USA that runs approximately east -west. The image was taken during the March Equinox of 2015, and shows the Sun down the road at sunset. In many cultures, this March equinox is taken to be the first day of a season, typically spring in Earth's northern hemisphere, and autumn in the south. Does your favorite street run east - west?

The Sky in 2021,"What if you could see the entire sky -- all at once -- for an entire year? That, very nearly, is what is pictured here.  Every 15 minutes during 2021, an all-sky camera took an image of the sky over the Netherlands. Central columns from these images were then aligned and combined to create the featured keogram, with January at the top, December at the bottom, and the middle of the night running vertically just left of center. What do we see?  Most obviously, the daytime sky is mostly blue, while the nighttime sky is mostly black.  The twelve light bands crossing the night sky are caused by the glow of the Moon. The thinnest part of the black hourglass shape occurs during the summer solstice when days are the longest, while the thickest part occurs at the winter solstice. Yesterday was an equinox -- when night and day were equal -- and the northern-spring equinox from one year ago can actually be located in the keogram -- about three-quarters of the way up.

A Whale of an Aurora over Swedish Forest,"What's that in the sky? An aurora. A large coronal mass ejection occurred on our Sun earlier this month, throwing a cloud of fast-moving electrons, protons, and ions toward the Earth. Part of this cloud impacted our Earth's magnetosphere and, bolstered by a sudden gap, resulted in spectacular auroras being seen at some high northern latitudes. Featured here is a particularly photogenic auroral corona captured above a forest in Sweden from a scenic perch overlooking the city of Östersund. To some,  this shimmering green glow of recombining atmospheric oxygen might appear like a large whale, but feel free to share what it looks like to you.

The Bubble Nebula from Hubble,"Massive stars can blow bubbles.  The featured image shows perhaps the most famous of all star-bubbles, NGC 7635, also known simply as The Bubble Nebula. Although it looks delicate, the 7-light-year diameter bubble offers evidence of violent processes at work. Above and left of the Bubble's center is a hot, O-type star, several hundred thousand times more luminous and some 45-times more massive than the Sun. A fierce stellar wind and intense radiation from that star has blasted out the structure of glowing gas against denser material in a surrounding molecular cloud. The intriguing Bubble Nebula and associated cloud complex lie a mere 7,100 light-years away toward the boastful constellation Cassiopeia.

Arp 78: Peculiar Galaxy in Aries,"Peculiar spiral galaxy Arp 78 is found within the boundaries of the head strong constellation Aries. Some 100 million light-years beyond the stars and nebulae of our Milky Way galaxy, the island universe is over 100,000 light-years across. Also known as NGC 772, it sports a prominent, outer spiral arm in this detailed cosmic portrait from the large Gemini North telescope near the summit of Maunakea, Hawaii, planet Earth. Tracking along sweeping dust lanes and lined with young blue star clusters, Arp 78's spiral arm is likely pumped-up by galactic-scale gravitational tidal interactions The close companion galaxy responsible is NGC 770, located off the upper right of this frame.

The Medusa Nebula,"Braided and serpentine filaments of glowing gas suggest this nebula's popular name, The Medusa Nebula. Also known as Abell 21, this Medusa is an old planetary nebula some 1,500 light-years away in the constellation Gemini. Like its mythological namesake, the nebula is associated with a dramatic transformation. The planetary nebula phase represents a final stage in the evolution of low mass stars like the sun as they transform themselves from red giants to hot white dwarf stars and in the process shrug off their outer layers. Ultraviolet radiation from the hot star powers the nebular glow. The Medusa's transforming star is the faint one near the center of the overall bright crescent shape. In this deep telescopic view, fainter filaments clearly extend above and left of the bright crescent region. The Medusa Nebula is estimated to be over 4 light-years across.","medusa, nebula, braided, serpentine, filament, glowing, suggest, popular, name, known, planetary, light-year, constellation, gemini, mythological, namesake, associated, dramatic, transformation, phase, represents, final, stage, evolution, mass, star, transform, giant, white, dwarf, process, shrug, outer, layer, ultraviolet, radiation, power, nebular, glow, transforming, faint, center, overall, bright, crescent, shape, deep, telescopic, view, fainter, extend, left, region, estimated"

It was captured by far flung New Horizons in July of 2015 when the spacecraft was at a range of some 21,000 kilometers from Pluto, about 19 minutes after its closest approach. A denizen of the Kuiper Belt in dramatic silhouette, the image also reveals Pluto's tenuous, surprisingly complex layers of hazy atmosphere.

Titan Seas Reflect Sunlight,"Why would the surface of Titan light up with a blinding flash? The reason: a sunglint from liquid seas.  Saturn's moon Titan has numerous smooth lakes of methane that, when the angle is right, reflect sunlight as if they were mirrors.  Pictured here in false-color, the robotic Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017 imaged the cloud-covered Titan in 2014 in different bands of cloud-piercing infrared light.  This specular reflection was so bright it saturated one of Cassini's infrared cameras. Although the sunglint was annoying -- it was also useful.  The reflecting regions confirm that northern Titan houses a wide and complex array of seas with a geometry that indicates periods of significant evaporation.  During its numerous passes of our Solar System's most mysterious moon, Cassini has revealed Titan to be a world with active weather -- including times when it rains a liquefied version of natural gas.","titan, reflect, sunlight, surface, light, blinding, flash, reason, sunglint, liquid, saturn, moon, numerous, smooth, lake, methane, angle, right, mirror, pictured, false-color, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, orbited, imaged, cloud-covered, different, band, cloud-piercing, infrared, specular, reflection, bright, saturated, camera, annoying, useful, reflecting, region, confirm, northern, house, wide, complex, array, geometry, indicates, period, significant, evaporation, pass, solar, system, mysterious, revealed, world, active, weather, including, time, rain, liquefied, version, natural"

The Southern Cross itself is topped by the bright, yellowish star Gamma Crucis.  A line from Gamma Crucis through the blue star at the bottom of the cross, Acrux, points toward the south celestial pole, located just above the small island in the featured picture -- taken in early March.  That island is Madivaru of the Maldives in the Indian Ocean. Against faint Milky Way starlight, the dark Coal Sack Nebula lies just left of the cross, while farther left along the Milky Way are the bright stars Alpha Centauri (left) and Beta Centauri (Hadar).  Alpha Centauri A, a Sun-like star anchoring a three-star system with exoplanets, is a mere 4.3 light-years distant.

Venus and Mars: Passing in the Night,"When two planets pass on the night sky, they can usually be seen near each other for a week or more. In the case of this planetary conjunction, Venus and Mars passed within 4 degrees of each other earlier this month. The featured image was taken a few days prior, when Venus was slowing rising in the pre-dawn sky, night by night, while Mars was slowly setting. The image, a four-part mosaic, was captured in Brazil from the small town Teresópolis. Besides Venus and Mars, the morning sky now also includes the more distant planet Saturn.  Of course, these conjunctions are only angular -- Venus, Mars, and Saturn continue to orbit the Sun in very different parts of our Solar System.  Next week, the angle between Saturn and Mars will drop to below a quarter of a degree.","venus, passing, night, planet, seen, week, case, planetary, conjunction, passed, degree, month, featured, image, taken, prior, slowing, rising, pre-dawn, setting, four-part, mosaic, captured, small, town, teresópolis, morning, includes, distant, saturn, course, angular, continue, orbit, different, part, solar, system, next, angle, drop, quarter"
Animation: Odd Radio Circles,"What do you call a cosmic puzzle that no one expected to see?  In this case, Odd Radio Circles, aka ORCs.  ORC-1 typifies the enigmatic five objects, only visible at radio frequencies, that were serendipitously discovered in 2019 using the new Australian SKA Pathfinder radio array.  The final image in the featured video uses 2021 data from the South African MeerKAT array to reveal more detail.  The radio data, assigned turquoise colors, are combined with a Dark Energy Survey optical/IR map.  The animated artist’s illustration explores just one idea about the ORCs’ origins.  If two supermassive black holes merge in the center of a galaxy, the associated shockwaves could generate rings of radio radiation.  These grow to fill the video frame.  The video zooms out so the expansion the ORC can be tracked until it is about a million light-years across.  Fortunately, the up-coming Square Kilometer Array can help test this and other promising scenarios.","animation, radio, circle, call, cosmic, puzzle, expected, case, orcs, orc-1, typifies, enigmatic, object, visible, frequency, discovered, using, australian, pathfinder, array, final, image, featured, video, data, south, african, meerkat, reveal, detail, assigned, turquoise, color, combined, dark, energy, survey, optical/ir, animated, artist, illustration, explores, idea, origin, supermassive, black, hole, merge, center, galaxy, associated, shockwaves, generate, ring, radiation, grow, fill, frame, zoom, expansion, tracked, light-year, up-coming, square, kilometer, help, test, promising, scenario"
Exploring the Antennae,"Some 60 million light-years away in the southerly constellation Corvus, two large galaxies are colliding. Stars in the two galaxies, cataloged as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039, very rarely collide in the course of the ponderous cataclysm that lasts for hundreds of millions of years. But the galaxies' large clouds of molecular gas and dust often do, triggering furious episodes of star formation near the center of the cosmic wreckage. Spanning over 500 thousand light-years, this stunning view also reveals new star clusters and matter flung far from the scene of the accident by gravitational tidal forces. The remarkably sharp ground-based image, an accumulation of 88 hours of exposure captured during 2012-2021, follows the faint tidal tails and distant background galaxies in the field of view. The suggestive overall visual appearance of the extended arcing structures gives the galaxy pair, also known as Arp 244, its popular name - The Antennae.","exploring, light-year, southerly, constellation, corvus, large, galaxy, colliding, star, cataloged, collide, course, ponderous, cataclysm, last, year, cloud, molecular, dust, triggering, furious, episode, formation, center, cosmic, wreckage, spanning, stunning, view, reveals, cluster, matter, flung, scene, accident, gravitational, tidal, force, sharp, ground-based, image, accumulation, hour, exposure, captured, 2012-2021, follows, faint, tail, distant, background, field, suggestive, overall, visual, appearance, extended, arcing, structure, give, pair, known, popular, name, antenna"
"Leaning Tower, Active Sun","The natural filter of a hazy atmosphere offered this recognizable architecture and sunset telephoto view on March 27. Dark against the solar disk, large sunspots in solar active regions 2975 and 2976 are wedged between the Duomo of Pisa and its famous Leaning Tower. Only one day later, Sun-staring spacecraft watched active region 2975 unleash a frenzy of solar flares along with two coronal mass ejections. The largest impacted the magnetosphere on March 31 triggering a geomagnetic storm and aurorae in high-latitude night skies. On March 30, active region 2975 erupted again with a powerful X-class solar flare that caused a temporary radio blackout on planet Earth.","leaning, tower, active, natural, filter, hazy, offered, recognizable, architecture, sunset, telephoto, view, march, dark, solar, disk, large, sunspot, region, wedged, duomo, famous, sun-staring, spacecraft, watched, unleash, frenzy, flare, coronal, mass, ejection, largest, impacted, triggering, geomagnetic, storm, aurora, high-latitude, night, erupted, powerful, x-class, caused, temporary, radio, blackout, planet, earth"
Nova Scotia Northern Lights,"This almost otherworldly display of northern lights was captured in clear skies during the early hours of March 31 from 44 degrees north latitude, planet Earth. In a five second exposure the scene looks north from Martinique Beach Provincial Park in Nova Scotia, Canada. Stars of the W-shaped constellation Cassiopeia shine well above the horizon, through the red tint of the higher altitude auroral glow. Auroral activity was anticipated by skywatchers alerted to the possibility of stormy space weather by Sun-staring spacecraft. The predicted geomagnetic storm was sparked as a coronal mass ejection, launched from prolific solar active region 2975, impacted our fair planet's magnetosphere.","nova, scotia, northern, light, display, captured, clear, early, hour, march, degree, north, latitude, planet, earth, second, exposure, scene, look, martinique, beach, provincial, park, canada, star, w-shaped, constellation, cassiopeia, shine, tint, higher, altitude, auroral, glow, activity, anticipated, skywatchers, alerted, possibility, stormy, space, sun-staring, spacecraft, predicted, geomagnetic, storm, sparked, coronal, mass, ejection, launched, solar, active, region, impacted, fair, magnetosphere"
CMB Dipole: Speeding Through the Universe,"Our Earth is not at rest.  The Earth moves around the Sun.  The Sun orbits the center of the Milky Way Galaxy.  The Milky Way Galaxy orbits in the Local Group of Galaxies.  The Local Group falls toward the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies.  But these speeds are less than the speed that all of these objects together move relative to the cosmic microwave background radiation (CMBR).  In the featured all-sky map from the COBE satellite in 1993, microwave light in the Earth's direction of motion appears blueshifted and hence hotter, while microwave light on the opposite side of the sky is redshifted and colder.  The map indicates that the Local Group moves at about 600 kilometers per second relative to this primordial radiation.  This high speed was initially unexpected and its magnitude is still unexplained.  Why are we moving so fast?  What is out there?","dipole, speeding, universe, earth, rest, move, orbit, center, milky, galaxy, local, group, fall, virgo, cluster, speed, less, object, relative, cosmic, microwave, background, radiation, cmbr, featured, all-sky, cobe, satellite, light, direction, motion, appears, blueshifted, opposite, side, redshifted, colder, indicates, kilometer, second, primordial, high, unexpected, magnitude, unexplained, moving"
A Vortex Aurora over Iceland,"No, the car was not in danger of being vacuumed into space by the big sky vortex. For one reason, the vortex was really an aurora, and since auroras are created by particles striking the Earth from space, they do not create a vacuum. This rapidly developing auroral display was caused by a Coronal Mass Ejection from the Sun that passed by the Earth closely enough to cause a ripple in Earth's magnetosphere.  The upper red parts of the aurora occur over 250 kilometers high with its red glow created by atmospheric atomic oxygen directly energized by incoming particles. The lower green parts of the aurora occur over 100 kilometers high with its green glow created by atmospheric atomic oxygen energized indirectly by collisions with first-energized molecular nitrogen.  Below 100 kilometers, there is little atomic oxygen, which is why auroras end abruptly. The concentric cylinders depict a dramatic auroral corona as seen from the side. The featured image was created from a single 3-second exposure taken in mid-March over Lake Myvatn in Iceland.

Seven Sisters versus California,"On the upper right, dressed in blue, is the Pleiades.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades is one of the brightest and most easily visible open clusters on the sky. The Pleiades contains over 3,000 stars, is about 400 light years away, and only 13 light years across. Surrounding the stars is a spectacular blue reflection nebula made of fine dust.  A common legend is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named. On the lower left, shining in red, is the California Nebula.  Named for its shape, the California Nebula is much dimmer and hence harder to see than the Pleiades.  Also known as NGC 1499, this mass of red glowing hydrogen gas is about 1,500 light years away. Although about 25 full moons could fit between them, the featured wide angle, deep field image composite has captured them both.  A careful inspection of the deep image will also reveal the star forming region IC 348 and the molecular cloud LBN 777 (the Baby Eagle Nebula).","sister, versus, california, upper, right, dressed, blue, pleiades, known, brightest, visible, open, cluster, contains, star, light, year, surrounding, spectacular, reflection, nebula, made, fine, dust, common, legend, brighter, faded, named, lower, shining, shape, much, dimmer, hence, mass, glowing, hydrogen, full, moon, featured, wide, angle, deep, field, image, composite, captured, careful, inspection, reveal, forming, region, molecular, cloud, baby, eagle"
Earendel: A Star in the Early Universe,"Is Earendel the farthest star yet discovered? This scientific possibility started when the Hubble Space Telescope observed a huge cluster of galaxies. The gravitational lens effect of this cluster was seen to magnify and distort a galaxy far in the background. This distorted background galaxy -- so far away it has a redshift of 6.2 -- appears in the featured image as a long red string, while beads on that string are likely to be star clusters.   The galaxy cluster lens creates a line of maximum magnification line where superposed background objects may appear magnified many thousands of times. On the intersection between the galaxy line and the maximum magnification line is one ""bead"" which shows evidence of originating from a single bright star in the early universe -- now named Earendel. Future investigations may include more imaging by Hubble to see how Earendel's brightness varies, and, quite possibly, by the new James Webb Space Telescope when it becomes operational later this year.  Earendel's  great distance exceeds that of any known stable star -- although the star that exploded creating GRB 090423 had a redshift of 8.2.","earendel, star, early, universe, farthest, discovered, scientific, possibility, started, hubble, space, telescope, observed, huge, cluster, galaxy, gravitational, lens, effect, seen, magnify, distort, distorted, background, redshift, appears, featured, image, string, bead, likely, creates, line, maximum, magnification, superposed, object, appear, magnified, many, time, intersection, show, evidence, originating, single, bright, named, future, investigation, include, imaging, brightness, varies, james, webb, becomes, operational, year, great, distance, exceeds, known, stable, exploded, creating"
Messier 24: Sagittarius Star Cloud,"Unlike most entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog of deep sky objects, M24 is not a bright galaxy, star cluster, or nebula. It's a gap in nearby, obscuring interstellar dust clouds that allows a view of the distant stars in the Sagittarius spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. When you gaze at the star cloud with binoculars or small telescope you are looking through a window over 300 light-years wide at stars some 10,000 light-years or more from Earth. Sometimes called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, M24's luminous stars fill this gorgeous starscape. Covering over 3 degrees or the width of 6 full moons in the constellation Sagittarius, the telescopic field of view includes dark markings B92 and B93 just above center, along with other clouds of dust and glowing nebulae toward the center of the Milky Way.","sagittarius, star, cloud, entry, charles, messier, famous, catalog, deep, object, bright, galaxy, cluster, nebula, obscuring, interstellar, dust, allows, view, distant, spiral, milky, gaze, binoculars, small, telescope, looking, window, light-year, wide, earth, called, luminous, gorgeous, starscape, covering, degree, width, full, moon, constellation, telescopic, field, includes, dark, marking, center, glowing"
Hale-Bopp: The Great Comet of 1997,"Only twenty-five years ago, Comet Hale-Bopp rounded the Sun and offered a dazzling spectacle in planet Earth's night skies. Digitized from the original astrophoto on 35mm color slide film, this classic image of the Great Comet of 1997 was recorded a few days after its perihelion passage on April 1, 1997. Made with a camera and telephoto lens piggy-backed on a small telescope, the 10 minute long, hand-guided exposure features the memorable tails of Hale-Bopp, a whitish dust tail and blue ion tail. Here, the ion tail extends well over ten degrees across the northern sky. In all, Hale-Bopp was reported as visible to the naked eye from late May 1996 through September 1997. Also known as C/1995 O1, Hale-Bopp is recognized as one of the most compositionally pristine comets to pass through the inner Solar System. A visitor from the distant Oort cloud, the comet's next perihelion passage should be around the year 4380 AD.

Mars-Saturn Conjunction,"Fainter stars in the zodiacal constellation Capricornus are scattered near the plane of the ecliptic in this field of view. The two brightest ones at center aren't stars at all though, but the planets Mars and Saturn. Taken on the morning of April 4, the telescopic snapshot captured their tantalizing close conjunction in a predawn sky, the pair of planets separated by only about 1/3 of a degree. That's easily less than the apparent width of a Full Moon. Can you tell which planet is which? If you guessed Mars is the redder one , you'd be right. Above Mars, slightly fainter Saturn still shines with a paler yellowish tinge in reflected sunlight.  Even at the low magnification, Saturn's largest and brightest moon Titan can be spotted hugging the planet very closely on the left.","mars-saturn, conjunction, fainter, star, zodiacal, constellation, capricornus, scattered, plane, ecliptic, field, view, brightest, center, planet, saturn, taken, morning, april, telescopic, snapshot, captured, tantalizing, close, predawn, pair, separated, degree, apparent, width, full, moon, tell, guessed, redder, right, shine, paler, yellowish, tinge, reflected, sunlight, magnification, largest, titan, spotted, hugging, left"
Shadows at the Moon's South Pole,"Was this image of the Moon's surface taken with a microscope? No -- it's a multi-temporal illumination map made with a wide-angle camera. 	 To create it, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft collected 1,700 images over a period of 6 lunar days (6 Earth months), repeatedly covering an area centered on the Moon's south pole from different angles.  The resulting images were stacked to produce the featured map -- representing the percentage of time each spot on the surface was illuminated by the Sun.  Remaining convincingly in shadow, the floor of the 19-kilometer diameter Shackleton crater is seen near the map's center.  The lunar south pole itself is at about 9 o'clock on the crater's rim.  Crater floors near the lunar south and north poles can remain in permanent shadow, while mountain tops can remain in nearly continuous sunlight.  Useful for future outposts, the shadowed crater floors could offer reservoirs of water-ice, while the sunlit mountain tops offer good locations to collect solar power.","shadow, moon, south, pole, image, surface, taken, microscope, multi-temporal, illumination, made, wide-angle, camera, create, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, spacecraft, collected, period, earth, month, covering, area, centered, different, angle, resulting, stacked, produce, featured, representing, percentage, time, spot, illuminated, remaining, floor, 19-kilometer, diameter, shackleton, crater, seen, center, o'clock, north, remain, permanent, mountain, continuous, sunlight, useful, future, outpost, shadowed, offer, reservoir, water-ice, sunlit, good, location, collect, solar, power"
A Space Station Crosses a Busy Sun,"Typically, the International Space Station is visible only at night.  Slowly drifting across the night sky as it orbits the Earth, the International Space Station (ISS) can be seen as a bright spot several times a year from many locations.  The ISS is then visible only just after sunset or just before sunrise because it shines by reflected sunlight -- once the ISS enters the Earth's shadow, it will drop out of sight. The only occasion when the ISS is visible during the day is when it passes right in front of the Sun. Then, it passes so quickly that only cameras taking short exposures can visually freeze the ISS's silhouette onto the background Sun. The featured picture did exactly that -- it is actually a series of images taken earlier this month from Beijing, China with perfect timing.  This image series was later combined with separate images taken at nearly the same time but highlighting the texture and activity on the busy Sun. The solar activity included numerous gaseous prominences seen around the edge, highlighted in red, filaments seen against the Sun's face, and a dark sunspot.","space, station, cross, busy, international, visible, night, drifting, orbit, earth, seen, bright, spot, several, time, year, many, location, sunset, sunrise, shine, reflected, sunlight, enters, shadow, drop, sight, occasion, pass, right, front, camera, taking, short, exposure, freeze, silhouette, background, featured, picture, series, image, taken, month, beijing, china, perfect, timing, combined, separate, highlighting, texture, activity, solar, included, numerous, gaseous, prominence, edge, highlighted, filament, face, dark, sunspot"
N11: Star Clouds of the LMC,"Massive stars, abrasive winds, mountains of dust, and energetic light sculpt one of the largest and most picturesque regions of star formation in the Local Group of Galaxies.  Known as N11, the region is visible on the upper right of many images of its home galaxy, the Milky Way neighbor known as the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC).  The featured image was taken for scientific purposes by the Hubble Space Telescope and reprocessed for artistry.  Although the section imaged above is known as NGC 1763, the entire N11 emission nebula is second in LMC size only to the Tarantula Nebula.  Compact globules of dark dust housing emerging young stars are also visible around the image.

Milky Way over Devils Tower,"What created Devils Tower? The origin of this extraordinary rock monolith in Wyoming, USA is still debated, with a leading hypothesis holding that it is a hardened lava plume that never reached the surface to become a volcano.  In this theory, the lighter rock that once surrounded the dense volcanic neck has now eroded away, leaving the dramatic tower. Known by Native Americans by names including  Bear's Lodge and Great Gray Horn, the dense rock includes the longest hexagonal columns known, some over 180-meters tall. High above, the central band of the Milky Way galaxy arches across the sky.  Many notable sky objects are visible, including dark strands of the Pipe Nebula and the reddish Lagoon Nebula to the tower's right.  Green grass and trees line the foreground, while clouds appear near the horizon to the tower's left.  Unlike many other international landmarks, mountaineers are permitted to climb Devils Tower.

Messier 96,"Spiral arms seem to swirl around the core of Messier 96 in this colorful, detailed portrait of a beautiful island universe. Of course M96 is a spiral galaxy, and counting the faint arms extending beyond the brighter central region it spans 100 thousand light-years or so. That's about the size of our own Milky Way. M96 is known to be 38 million light-years distant, a dominant member of the Leo I galaxy group. Background galaxies and smaller Leo I group members can be found by examining the picture. The most intriguing one is itself a spiral galaxy seen nearly edge on behind the outer spiral arm near the 1 o'clock position from center. Its bright central bulge cut by its own dark dust clouds, the edge-on background spiral appears to be about 1/5 the size of M96. If that background galaxy is similar in actual size to M96, then it would be about 5 times farther away.","spiral, seem, swirl, core, messier, colorful, detailed, portrait, beautiful, island, universe, course, galaxy, counting, faint, extending, brighter, central, region, span, light-year, size, milky, known, distant, dominant, member, group, background, smaller, found, examining, picture, intriguing, seen, edge, outer, o'clock, position, center, bright, bulge, dark, dust, cloud, edge-on, appears, similar, actual, time, farther"

Alnitak, the easternmost (left) of the belt stars is seen next to the more diffuse glow of the Flame Nebula and the dark notch of the famous Horsehead. Easily visible to the naked-eye The Great Nebula of Orion is below the belt stars. A mere 1,500 light-years distant, it is the closest large stellar nursery to our fair planet. Best seen in photographs, the broad and faint arc of Barnard's Loop seems to embrace Orion's brighter stars and nebulae though.

Shuttle Over Earth,"What's that approaching? Astronauts on board the International Space Station in 2010 first saw it far in the distance.  Soon it enlarged to become a dark silhouette. As it came even closer, the silhouette appeared to be a spaceship. Finally, the object revealed itself to be the Space Shuttle Endeavour, and it soon docked as expected with the Earth-orbiting space station.  Pictured here, Endeavour was imaged near Earth's horizon as it approached, where several layers of the Earth's atmosphere were visible. Directly behind the shuttle is the mesosphere, which appears blue.  The atmospheric layer that appears white is the stratosphere, while the orange layer is Earth's Troposphere.

Stars and Planets over Portugal,"The mission was to document night-flying birds -- but it ended up also documenting a beautiful sky. The featured wide-angle mosaic was taken over the steppe golden fields in Mértola, Portugal in 2020. From such a dark location, an immediately-evident breathtaking glow arched over the night sky: the central band of our Milky Way galaxy.  But this sky had much more. Thin clouds crossed the sky like golden ribbons. The planet Mars appeared on the far left, while the planets Saturn and Jupiter were also simultaneously visible -- but on the opposite side of the sky, here seen on the far right.  Near the top of the image the bright star Vega can be found, while the far-distant and faint Andromeda Galaxy can be seen toward the left, just below Milky Way's arch.

Seen toward the bottom of the image are small, dark molecular clouds rich in obscuring cosmic dust. Called Thackeray's Globules for their discoverer, these ""eggs"" are potential sites for the gravitational condensation of new stars, although their fates are uncertain as they are also being rapidly eroded away by the intense radiation from nearby young stars.

Messier 104,"A gorgeous spiral galaxy, Messier 104 is famous for its nearly edge-on profile featuring a broad ring of obscuring dust lanes. Seen in silhouette against an extensive central bulge of stars, the swath of cosmic dust lends a broad brimmed hat-like appearance to the galaxy suggesting a more popular moniker, the Sombrero Galaxy. This sharp view of the well-known galaxy was made from over 10 hours of Hubble Space Telescope image data, processed to bring out faint details often lost in the overwhelming glare of M104's bright central bulge. Also known as NGC 4594, the Sombrero galaxy can be seen across the spectrum, and is host to a central supermassive black hole. About 50,000 light-years across and 28 million light-years away, M104 is one of the largest galaxies at the southern edge of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster.

Split the Universe,"Just now, before you hit the button, two future universes are possible.  After pressing the button, though, you will live in only one.  A real-web version of the famous Schrödinger's cat experiment clicking the red button in the featured astronaut image should transform that image into a picture of the same astronaut holding one of two cats -- one living, or one dead.  The timing of your click, combined with the wiring of your brain and the millisecond timing of your device, will all conspire together to create a result dominated, potentially, by the randomness of quantum mechanics.  Some believe that your personally-initiated quantum decision will split the universe in two, and that both the live-cat and dead-cat universes exist in separate parts of a larger multiverse. Others believe that the result of your click will collapse the two possible universes into one -- in a way that could not have been predicted beforehand.

The Great Nebula in Carina,"In one of the brightest parts of Milky Way lies a nebula where some of the oddest things occur. NGC 3372, known as the Great Nebula in Carina, is home to massive stars and changing nebulas. The Keyhole Nebula (NGC 3324), the bright structure just below the image center, houses several of these massive stars. The entire Carina Nebula, captured here, spans over 300 light years and lies about 7,500 light-years away in the constellation of Carina.  Eta Carinae, the most energetic star in the nebula, was one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then faded dramatically. While Eta Carinae itself maybe on the verge of a supernova explosion, X-ray images indicate that much of the Great Nebula in Carina has been a veritable supernova factory.","great, nebula, carina, brightest, part, milky, oddest, thing, occur, known, home, massive, star, changing, keyhole, bright, structure, image, center, house, several, entire, captured, span, light, year, light-year, constellation, energetic, faded, verge, supernova, explosion, x-ray, indicate, veritable, factory"
Planet Parade over Sydney Opera House,"The world is waking up to a picturesque planet parade. Just before dawn, the eastern skies over much of planet Earth are decorated by a notable line of familiar planets. In much of Earth's northern hemisphere, this line of planets appears most nearly horizontal, but in much of Earth's southern hemisphere, the line appears more nearly vertical. Pictured over the Sydney Opera House in southern Australia, the planet line was captured nearly vertical about five days ago.  From top to bottom, the morning planets are Saturn, Mars, Venus, and Jupiter.  As April ends, the angular distance between Venus and Jupiter will gradually pass below a degree as they switch places.  Then, as May ends, Jupiter will pass near Mars as those two planets switch places.  In June, the parade will briefly expand to include Mercury.

Moon Shadow on Jupiter,"What is that large dark spot on Jupiter? It's the shadow of Ganymede,  Jupiter's largest moon. When Jupiter's moons cross between the Jovian giant and the Sun, they created shadows just like when the Earth's moon crosses between the Earth and the Sun. Also like on Earth, if you were in a dark shadow on Jupiter, you would see a moon completely eclipse the Sun. Unlike on Earth, moon shadows occur most days on Jupiter -- what's more unusual is that a spacecraft was close enough to record one with a high-resolution image.  That spacecraft, Juno, was passing so close to Jupiter in late February that nearby clouds and the dark eclipse shadow appear relatively large. Juno has made many discoveries about our Solar System's largest planet, including, recently, rapidly expanding circular auroras.

Lyrid of the Lake,"In the early hours of April 24 this bright Lyrid meteor flashed along the central Milky Way. For a moment, it cast a bright reflection across Lake Nian, Yunnan province, China. The annual Lyrid meteor shower, one of the oldest known, is active in late April, as our fair planet plows through dust left along the orbit of long-period comet Thatcher. The trail of the bright fireball points back toward the shower's radiant in the constellation Lyra high in the northern springtime sky and off the top of the frame. Just rising in that starry sky, light from a third quarter moon also cast a glow on the peaceful waters of the lake.","lyrid, lake, early, hour, bright, meteor, flashed, central, milky, moment, cast, reflection, nian, yunnan, province, china, annual, shower, oldest, known, active, late, april, fair, planet, plow, dust, left, orbit, long-period, comet, thatcher, trail, fireball, point, radiant, constellation, lyra, high, northern, springtime, frame, rising, starry, light, third, quarter, moon, glow, peaceful, water"
Portrait of NGC 3628,"Sharp telescopic views of NGC 3628 show a puffy galactic disk divided by dark dust lanes. Of course, this portrait of the magnificent, edge-on spiral galaxy puts some astronomers in mind of its popular moniker, the Hamburger Galaxy. It also reveals a small galaxy nearby (below), likely a satellite of NGC 3628, and a very faint but extensive tidal tail. The drawn out tail stretches for about 300,000 light-years, even beyond the upper left edge of the frame. NGC 3628 shares its neighborhood in the local universe with two other large spirals M65 and M66 in a grouping otherwise known as the Leo Triplet. Gravitational interactions with its cosmic neighbors are likely responsible for creating the tidal tail, as well as the extended flare and warp of this spiral's disk. The tantalizing island universe itself is about 100,000 light-years across and 35 million light-years away in the northern springtime constellation Leo.","portrait, sharp, telescopic, view, show, puffy, galactic, disk, divided, dark, dust, lane, course, magnificent, edge-on, spiral, galaxy, mind, popular, moniker, hamburger, reveals, small, likely, satellite, faint, extensive, tidal, tail, drawn, stretch, light-year, upper, left, edge, frame, share, neighborhood, local, universe, large, grouping, known, triplet, gravitational, interaction, cosmic, neighbor, responsible, creating, extended, flare, warp, tantalizing, island, northern, springtime, constellation"
M44: The Beehive Cluster,"A mere 600 light-years away, M44 is one of the closest star clusters to our solar system. Also known as the Praesepe or the Beehive cluster its stars are young though, about 600 million years old compared to our Sun's 4.5 billion years. Based on similar ages and motion through space, M44 and the even closer Hyades star cluster in Taurus are thought to have been born together in the same large molecular cloud. An open cluster spanning some 15 light-years, M44 holds 1,000 stars or so and covers about 3 full moons (1.5 degrees) on the sky in the constellation Cancer. Visible to the unaided eye, M44 has been recognized since antiquity. Described as a faint cloud or celestial mist long before being included as the 44th entry in Charles Messier's 18th century catalog, the cluster was not resolved into its individual stars until telescopes were available. A popular target for modern, binocular-equipped sky gazers, the cluster's few yellowish tinted, cool, red giants are scattered through the field of its brighter hot blue main sequence stars in this telescopic group snapshot. Dramatic diffraction spikes highlighting the brighter cluster members were created with string crossed in front of the telescope's objective lens.","beehive, cluster, light-year, closest, star, solar, system, known, young, year, compared, based, similar, motion, space, hyades, taurus, thought, born, large, molecular, cloud, open, spanning, hold, cover, full, moon, degree, constellation, cancer, visible, unaided, recognized, antiquity, described, faint, celestial, mist, included, entry, charles, messier, 18th, century, catalog, resolved, individual, telescope, available, popular, target, modern, binocular-equipped, gazers, yellowish, tinted, cool, giant, scattered, field, brighter, blue, main, sequence, telescopic, group, snapshot, dramatic, diffraction, spike, highlighting, member, created, string, crossed, front, objective, lens"
First Horizon-Scale Image of a Black Hole,"What does a black hole look like? To find out, radio telescopes from around the Earth coordinated observations of black holes with the largest known event horizons on the sky.  Alone, black holes are just black, but these monster attractors are known to be surrounded by glowing gas.  This first image resolves the area around the black hole at the center of galaxy M87 on a scale below that expected for its event horizon.  Pictured, the dark central region is not the event horizon, but rather the black hole's shadow -- the central region of emitting gas darkened by the central black hole's gravity. The size and shape of the shadow is determined by bright gas near the event horizon, by strong gravitational lensing deflections, and by the black hole's spin.  In resolving this black hole's shadow, the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) bolstered evidence that Einstein's gravity works even in extreme regions, and gave clear evidence that M87 has a central spinning black hole of about 6 billion solar masses.  Since releasing this featured image in 2019, the EHT has expanded to include more telescopes, observe more black holes, track polarized light,and is working to observe the immediately vicinity of the black hole in the center of our Milky Way Galaxy.

Partial Solar Eclipse over Argentina,"What's happened to the Sun? Two days ago, parts of South America were treated to a partial solar eclipse -- where the Moon blocked out part of the Sun.  The featured image shows an image of the partially eclipsed Sun through clouds as it was setting over Patagonia, Argentina. In the tilted image, Earth is toward the right. During the eclipse, the Moon moved partly between Earth and the Sun. Although a visually impressive sight, the slight dimming of surroundings  during this partial eclipse was less noticeable than dimming created by a thick cloud. In about two weeks, all of South America and part of North America will experience a total lunar eclipse -- where the Earth moves completely between the Moon and the Sun.  In about two years, a total solar eclipse will cross North America.","partial, solar, eclipse, argentina, happened, part, south, america, treated, moon, blocked, featured, image, show, eclipsed, cloud, setting, patagonia, tilted, earth, right, moved, impressive, sight, slight, dimming, surroundings, noticeable, created, thick, week, north, experience, total, lunar, move, year, cross"
Mercury's Sodium Tail,"That's no comet.  Below the Pleiades star cluster is actually a planet: Mercury. Long exposures of our Solar System's innermost planet may reveal something unexpected: a tail. Mercury's thin atmosphere contains small amounts of sodium that glow when excited by light from the Sun. Sunlight also liberates these atoms from Mercury's surface and pushes them away. The yellow glow from sodium, in particular, is relatively bright.  Pictured, Mercury and its sodium tail are visible in a deep image taken last week from La Palma, Spain through a filter that primarily transmits yellow light emitted by sodium. First predicted in the 1980s, Mercury's tail was first discovered in 2001. Many tail details were revealed in multiple observations by NASA's robotic MESSENGER spacecraft that orbited Mercury between 2011 and 2015.  Tails, of course, are usually associated with comets.","mercury, sodium, tail, comet, pleiades, star, cluster, planet, long, exposure, solar, system, innermost, reveal, something, unexpected, thin, atmosphere, contains, small, amount, glow, excited, light, sunlight, liberates, atom, surface, push, yellow, particular, bright, pictured, visible, deep, image, taken, last, week, palma, spain, filter, transmits, emitted, predicted, discovered, many, detail, revealed, multiple, observation, nasa, robotic, messenger, spacecraft, orbited, course, associated"
Planets Over Egyptian Pyramid,"The early morning planet parade continues. Visible the world over, the planets Jupiter, Venus, Mars and Saturn have been lining up in the pre-dawn sky since mid-April. In the featured image taken last month, these planets were captured over the Step Pyramid of Djoser, a UNESCO World Heritage Site. Located in the Saqqara necropolis of Egypt, the pyramid was constructed in the 27th century BC and is one of the oldest pyramids known.  The two-image composite includes a foreground image taken during evening blue hour, and a background image captured from the same location the following morning.  The morning planet line-up is slowly changing.  At the end of last month, planets Jupiter and Venus switched places, while at the end of this month, Jupiter and Mars will switch after passing within one-degree of each other. Of course, this picturesque planetary angular alignment is a coincidence, as all of these worlds continue to orbit the Sun as they have for billions of years, well before even the ancient Pyramid of Djoser was built.

NGC 3521: Galaxy in a Bubble,"Gorgeous spiral galaxy NGC 3521 is a mere 35 million light-years away, toward the northern springtime constellation Leo. Relatively bright in planet Earth's sky, NGC 3521 is easily visible in small telescopes but often overlooked by amateur imagers in favor of other Leo spiral galaxies, like M66 and M65. It's hard to overlook in this colorful cosmic portrait though. Spanning some 50,000 light-years the galaxy sports characteristic patchy, irregular spiral arms laced with dust, pink star forming regions, and clusters of young, blue stars. This deep image also finds NGC 3521 embedded in fainter, gigantic, bubble-like shells. The shells are likely tidal debris, streams of stars torn from satellite galaxies that have undergone mergers with NGC 3521 in the distant past.","galaxy, bubble, gorgeous, spiral, light-year, northern, springtime, constellation, bright, planet, earth, visible, small, telescope, overlooked, amateur, imagers, favor, hard, overlook, colorful, cosmic, portrait, spanning, sport, characteristic, patchy, irregular, laced, dust, pink, star, forming, region, cluster, young, blue, deep, image, find, embedded, gigantic, bubble-like, shell, tidal, debris, stream, torn, satellite, undergone, merger, distant, past"
NGC 3572 and the Southern Tadpoles,"This cosmic skyscape features glowing gas and dark dust clouds along side the young stars of NGC 3572. A beautiful emission nebula and star cluster it sails far southern skies within the nautical constellation Carina. Stars from NGC 3572 are toward top center in the telescopic frame that would measure about 100 light-years across at the cluster's estimated distance of 9,000 light-years. The visible interstellar gas and dust is part of the star cluster's natal molecular cloud. Dense streamers of material within the nebula, eroded by stellar winds and radiation, clearly trail away from the energetic young stars. They are likely sites of ongoing star formation with shapes reminiscent of the Tadpoles of IC 410 better known to northern skygazers.  In the coming tens to hundreds of millions of years, gas and stars in the cluster will be dispersed though, by gravitational tides and by violent supernova explosions that end the short lives of the massive cluster stars.","southern, tadpole, cosmic, skyscape, feature, glowing, dark, dust, cloud, side, young, star, beautiful, emission, nebula, cluster, sail, nautical, constellation, carina, center, telescopic, frame, measure, light-year, estimated, distance, visible, interstellar, part, natal, molecular, dense, streamer, material, eroded, stellar, wind, radiation, trail, energetic, likely, site, ongoing, formation, shape, reminiscent, better, known, northern, skygazers, coming, year, dispersed, gravitational, tide, violent, supernova, explosion, short, life, massive"
Firefall by Moonlight,"On certain dates in February, an elusive firefall can be spotted at sunset in Yosemite National Park, when water flows, the weather cooperates and the direction to the setting Sun is just right. Often photographed from vantage points below, at the right moment the park's seasonal Horsetail Fall is isolated in the shadows of the steep walls of El Capitan. Then, still illuminated with rays of reddened sunlight the waterfall briefly takes on a dramatic, fiery appearance. But a Horsetail firefall can be photographed by moonlight too. Even more elusive by moonlight, the firefall effect can also be seen when a bright Moon sets at the right direction along the western horizon. And skies were clear enough for this well-planned imaging of an ephemeral Horsetail firefall, lit by a bright gibbous Moon setting in the early morning hours of April 15.","firefall, moonlight, certain, date, february, elusive, spotted, sunset, yosemite, national, park, water, flow, weather, cooperates, direction, setting, photographed, vantage, point, right, moment, seasonal, horsetail, fall, isolated, shadow, steep, wall, capitan, illuminated, reddened, sunlight, waterfall, briefly, take, dramatic, fiery, appearance, effect, seen, bright, moon, western, horizon, clear, well-planned, imaging, ephemeral, gibbous, early, morning, hour, april"
Spiral Galaxy NGC 1512: The Inner Rings,"Most galaxies don't have any rings -- why does this galaxy have two?  To begin, the bright band near NGC 1512's center is a nuclear ring, a ring that surrounds the galaxy center and glows brightly with recently formed stars. Most stars and accompanying gas and dust, however, orbit the galactic center in a ring much further out -- here seen near the image edge. This ring is called, counter-intuitively, the inner ring.  If you look closely, you will see this the inner ring connects ends of a diffuse central bar that runs horizontally across the galaxy. These ring structures are thought to be caused by NGC 1512's own asymmetries in a drawn-out process called secular evolution.  The gravity of these galaxy asymmetries, including the bar of stars, cause gas and dust to fall from the inner ring to the nuclear ring, enhancing this ring's rate of star formation.  Some spiral galaxies also have a third ring -- an outer ring that circles the galaxy even further out.","spiral, galaxy, inner, ring, begin, bright, band, center, nuclear, surround, glow, formed, star, accompanying, dust, galactic, much, seen, image, edge, called, counter-intuitively, look, connects, central, structure, thought, caused, asymmetry, drawn-out, process, secular, evolution, gravity, including, cause, fall, enhancing, rate, formation, third, outer, circle"
A Martian Eclipse: Phobos Crosses the Sun,"What's that passing in front of the Sun? It looks like a moon, but it can't be Earth's Moon, because it isn't round. It's the Martian moon Phobos.  The featured video was taken from the surface of Mars a month ago by the Perseverance rover. Phobos, at 11.5 kilometers across, is 150 times smaller than Luna (our moon) in diameter, but also 50 times closer to its parent planet.  In fact, Phobos is so close to Mars that it is expected to break up and crash into Mars within the next 50 million years.  In the near term, the low orbit of Phobos results in more rapid solar eclipses than seen from Earth. The featured video is shown in real time -- the transit really took about 40 seconds,as shown.

NGC 6334: The Cat's Paw Nebula,"Nebulas are perhaps as famous for being identified with familiar shapes as perhaps cats are for getting into trouble.  Still, no known cat could have created the vast Cat's Paw Nebula visible toward the constellation of the Scorpion  (Scorpius.  At 5,500 light years distant, Cat's Paw is an emission nebula with a red color that originates from an abundance of ionized hydrogen atoms.  Alternatively known as the Bear Claw Nebula and cataloged as NGC 6334, stars nearly ten times the mass of our Sun have been born there in only the past few million years.

Gravity's Grin,"Albert Einstein's general theory of relativity, published over 100 years ago, predicted the phenomenon of gravitational lensing. And that's what gives these distant galaxies such a whimsical appearance, seen through the looking glass of X-ray and optical image data from the Chandra and Hubble space telescopes. Nicknamed the Cheshire Cat galaxy group, the group's two large elliptical galaxies are suggestively framed by arcs. The arcs are optical images of distant background galaxies lensed by the foreground group's total distribution of gravitational mass. Of course, that gravitational mass is dominated by dark matter. The two large elliptical ""eye"" galaxies represent the brightest members of their own galaxy groups which are merging. Their relative collisional speed of nearly 1,350 kilometers/second heats gas to millions of degrees producing the X-ray glow shown in purple hues. Curiouser about galaxy group mergers?

Young Stars of NGC 346,"The massive stars of NGC 346 are short lived, but very energetic. The star cluster is embedded in the largest star forming region in the Small Magellanic Cloud, some 210,000 light-years distant. Their winds and radiation sweep out an interstellar cavern in the gas and dust cloud about 200 light-years across, triggering star formation and sculpting the region's dense inner edge. Cataloged as N66, the star forming region also appears to contain a large population of infant stars. A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet burning hydrogen in their cores, the infant stars are strewn about the embedded star cluster. In this false-color Hubble Space Telescope image, visible and near-infrared light are seen as blue and green, while light from atomic hydrogen emission is red.","young, star, massive, short, lived, energetic, cluster, embedded, largest, forming, region, small, magellanic, cloud, light-year, distant, wind, radiation, sweep, interstellar, cavern, dust, triggering, formation, sculpting, dense, inner, edge, cataloged, appears, contain, large, population, infant, year, burning, hydrogen, core, strewn, false-color, hubble, space, telescope, image, visible, near-infrared, light, seen, blue, green, atomic, emission"
The Milky Way's Black Hole,"There's a black hole at the center of the Milky Way. Stars are observed to orbit a very massive and compact object there known as Sgr A* (say ""sadge-ay-star""). But this just released radio image (inset) from planet Earth's Event Horizon Telescope is the first direct evidence of the Milky Way's central black hole. As predicted by Einstein's Theory of General Relativity, the four million solar mass black hole's strong gravity is bending light and creating a shadow-like dark central region surrounded by a bright ring-like structure. Supporting observations made by space-based telescopes and ground-based observatories provide a wider view of the galactic center's dynamic environment and an important context for the Event Horizon Telescope's black hole image. The main panel image shows the X-ray data from Chandra and infrared data from Hubble.

Ice Halos by Moonlight,"An almost full moon on April 15 brought these luminous apparitions to a northern spring night over Alberta Canada. On that night, bright moonlight refracted and reflected by hexagonal ice crystals in high clouds created a complex of halos and arcs more commonly seen by sunlight in daytime skies. While the colors of the arcs and moondogs or paraselenae were just visible to the unaided eye, a blend of exposures ranging from 30 seconds to 1/20 second was used to render this moonlit wide-angle skyscape. The Big Dipper at the top of the frame sits just above a smiling and rainbow-hued circumzenithal arc. With Arcturus left and Regulus toward the right the Moon is centered in its often spotted 22 degree halo. May 15 will also see the bright light of a Full Moon shining in Earth's night skies.

Colors of the Moon,"What color is the Moon? It depends on the night.  Outside of the Earth's atmosphere, the dark Moon, which shines by reflected sunlight, appears a magnificently brown-tinged gray.  Viewed from inside the Earth's atmosphere, though, the moon can appear quite different.  The featured image highlights a collection of apparent colors of the full moon documented by one astrophotographer over 10 years from different locations across Italy. A red or yellow colored moon usually indicates a moon seen near the horizon.  There, some of the blue light has been scattered away by a long path through the Earth's atmosphere, sometimes laden with fine dust. A blue-colored moon is more rare and can indicate a moon seen through an atmosphere carrying larger dust particles.  What created the purple moon is unclear -- it may be a combination of several effects.  The last image captures the total lunar eclipse of 2018 July -- where the moon, in Earth's shadow, appeared a faint red -- due to light refracted through air around the Earth.  Today there is not only another full moon but a total lunar eclipse visible to observers in North and South America -- an occurrence that may lead to some unexpected lunar colorings.","color, moon, depends, night, earth, atmosphere, dark, shine, reflected, sunlight, appears, brown-tinged, gray, viewed, appear, different, featured, image, highlight, collection, apparent, full, documented, astrophotographer, year, location, italy, yellow, colored, indicates, seen, horizon, blue, light, scattered, long, path, laden, fine, dust, blue-colored, rare, indicate, carrying, larger, particle, created, purple, unclear, combination, several, effect, last, capture, total, lunar, eclipse, july, shadow, appeared, faint, refracted, today, visible, north, south, america, occurrence, lead, unexpected, coloring"
Milky Way over French Alp Hoodoos,"Real castles aren't this old.  And the background galaxy is even older. Looking a bit like an alien castle, the pictured rock spires are called hoodoos and are likely millions of years old. Rare, but found around the world, hoodoos form when dense rocks slow the erosion of softer rock underneath.  The pictured hoodoos survive in the French Alps and are named Demoiselles Coiffées -- which translates to English as ""Ladies with Hairdos"". The background galaxy is part of the central disk of our own Milky Way galaxy and contains stars that are typically billions of years old. The photogenic Cygnus sky region -- rich in dusty dark clouds and red glowing nebulas -- appears just above and behind the hoodoos.

NGC 1316: After Galaxies Collide,"Astronomers turn detectives when trying to figure out the cause of startling sights like NGC 1316.  Investigations indicate that NGC 1316 is an enormous elliptical galaxy that started, about 100 million years ago, to devour a smaller spiral galaxy neighbor, NGC 1317, just on the upper right. Supporting evidence includes the dark dust lanes characteristic of a spiral galaxy, and faint swirls and shells of stars and gas visible in this wide and deep image. One thing that >remains unexplained is the unusually small globular star clusters, seen as faint dots on the image. Most elliptical galaxies have more and brighter globular clusters than NGC 1316.  Yet the observed globulars are too old to have been created by the recent spiral collision.  One hypothesis is that these globulars survive from an even earlier galaxy that was subsumed into NGC 1316. Another surprising attribute of NGC 1316, also known as Fornax A, is its giant lobes of gas that glow brightly in radio waves.","galaxy, collide, astronomer, turn, detective, trying, figure, cause, startling, sight, investigation, indicate, enormous, elliptical, started, year, devour, smaller, spiral, neighbor, upper, right, supporting, evidence, includes, dark, dust, lane, characteristic, faint, swirl, shell, star, visible, wide, deep, image, thing, remains, unexplained, small, globular, cluster, seen, brighter, observed, globulars, created, recent, collision, hypothesis, survive, earlier, subsumed, surprising, attribute, known, fornax, giant, lobe, glow, radio, wave"
A Jewel on the Flower Moon,"Cloudy skies plagued some sky watchers on Sunday as May's Full Flower Moon slipped through Earth's shadow in a total lunar eclipse. In skies above Chile's Atacama desert this telephoto snapshot still captured an awesome spectacle though. Seen through thin high cirrus clouds just before totality began, a last sliver of sunlit crescent glistens like a hazy jewel atop the mostly shadowed lunar disk. This full moon was near perigee, the closest point in its elliptical orbit. It passed near the center of Earth's dark umbral shadow during the 90 minute long total eclipse phase. Faintly suffused with sunlight scattered by the atmosphere, the umbral shadow itself gave the eclipsed moon a reddened appearance and the very dramatic popular moniker of a Blood Moon.","jewel, flower, moon, cloudy, plagued, watcher, sunday, full, slipped, earth, shadow, total, lunar, eclipse, chile, atacama, desert, telephoto, snapshot, captured, awesome, spectacle, seen, thin, high, cirrus, cloud, totality, began, last, sliver, sunlit, crescent, glisten, hazy, atop, shadowed, disk, perigee, closest, point, elliptical, orbit, passed, center, dark, umbral, minute, long, phase, suffused, sunlight, scattered, gave, eclipsed, reddened, dramatic, popular, moniker, blood"
A Digital Lunar Eclipse,"Recorded on May 15/16 this sequence of exposures follows the Full Moon during a total lunar eclipse as it arcs above treetops in the clearing skies of central Florida. A frame taken every 5 minutes by a digital camera shows the progression of the eclipse over three hours. The bright lunar disk grows dark and red as it glides through planet Earth's shadow. In fact, counting the central frames in the sequence measures the roughly 90 minute duration of the total phase of this eclipse. Around 270 BC, the Greek astronomer Aristarchus also measured the duration of total lunar eclipses, but probably without the benefit of digital watches and cameras. Still, using geometry he devised a simple and impressively accurate way to calculate the Moon's distance in terms of the radius of planet Earth, from the eclipse duration.","digital, lunar, eclipse, recorded, sequence, exposure, follows, full, moon, total, treetop, clearing, central, florida, frame, taken, minute, camera, show, progression, hour, bright, disk, grows, dark, glide, planet, earth, shadow, fact, counting, measure, duration, phase, greek, astronomer, aristarchus, measured, benefit, watch, using, geometry, devised, simple, accurate, calculate, distance, term, radius"
A View from Earth's Shadow,"This serene sand and skyscape finds the Dune of Pilat on the coast of France still in Earth's shadow during the early morning hours of May 16. Extending into space, the planet's dark umbral shadow covered the Moon on that date. From that location the total phase of a lunar eclipse had begun before moonset. Still in sunlight though, the International Space Station crossed from the western horizon and Earth's largest artificial moon traced the bright flat arc through the sky over 400 km above. Simply constructed, the well-planned panoramic scene was captured over a 5 minutes in a series of consecutive images.","view, earth, shadow, serene, sand, skyscape, find, dune, pilat, coast, france, early, morning, hour, extending, space, planet, dark, umbral, covered, moon, date, location, total, phase, lunar, eclipse, begun, sunlight, international, station, crossed, western, horizon, largest, artificial, traced, bright, flat, constructed, well-planned, panoramic, scene, captured, minute, series, consecutive, image"
Planetary Nebula Abell 7,"Very faint planetary nebula Abell 7 is some 1,800 light-years distant, just south of Orion in planet Earth's skies in the constellation Lepus, The Hare. Surrounded by Milky Way stars and near the line-of-sight to distant background galaxies, its generally simple spherical shape, about 8 light-years in diameter, is outlined in this deep telescopic image. Within its confines are beautiful, more complex details enhanced by the use of narrowband filters. Emission from hydrogen is shown in reddish hues with oxygen emission mapped to green and blue colors, giving Abell 7 a natural appearance that would otherwise be much too faint to be appreciated by eye. A planetary nebula represents a very brief final phase in stellar evolution that our own Sun will experience 5 billion years hence, as the nebula's central, once sun-like star shrugs off its outer layers. Abell 7 itself is estimated to be 20,000 years old. Its central star is seen here as a fading white dwarf some 10 billion years old.","planetary, nebula, faint, abell, light-year, distant, south, orion, planet, earth, constellation, lepus, hare, surrounded, milky, star, line-of-sight, background, galaxy, simple, spherical, shape, diameter, outlined, deep, telescopic, image, confines, beautiful, complex, detail, enhanced, narrowband, filter, emission, hydrogen, shown, reddish, oxygen, mapped, green, blue, color, giving, natural, appearance, much, appreciated, represents, brief, final, phase, stellar, evolution, year, hence, central, sun-like, shrug, outer, layer, estimated, seen, fading, white, dwarf"
A Large Tsunami Shock Wave on the Sun,"Tsunamis this large don't happen on Earth.  During 2006, a large solar flare from an Earth-sized sunspot produced a tsunami-type shock wave that was spectacular even for the Sun.  Pictured here, the tsunami wave was captured moving out from active region AR 10930 by the Optical Solar Patrol Network (OSPAN) telescope in New Mexico, USA.  The resulting shock wave, known technically as a Moreton wave, compressed and heated up gasses including hydrogen in the photosphere of the Sun, causing a momentarily brighter glow.  The featured image was taken in a very specific red color emitted exclusively by hydrogen gas.  The rampaging tsunami took out some active filaments on the Sun, although many re-established themselves later.  The solar tsunami spread at nearly one million kilometers per hour, and circled the entire Sun in a matter of minutes.","large, tsunami, shock, wave, happen, earth, solar, flare, earth-sized, sunspot, produced, tsunami-type, spectacular, pictured, captured, moving, active, region, optical, patrol, network, ospan, telescope, mexico, resulting, known, moreton, compressed, heated, including, hydrogen, causing, glow, featured, image, taken, specific, color, emitted, rampaging, took, filament, many, re-established, spread, kilometer, hour, circled, entire, matter, minute"
The Once and Future Stars of Andromeda,"This picture of Andromeda shows not only where stars are now, but where stars will soon be. Of course, the big, beautiful Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is a spiral galaxy -- and a mere 2.5 million light-years away.  Both space-based and ground-based observatories have been here combined to produce this intriguing composite image of Andromeda, at wavelengths both inside and outside normally visible light. The visible light shows where M31's stars are now -- as highlighted in white and blue hues and imaged by the Hubble, Subaru, and Mayall telescopes.  The infrared light shows where M31's future stars will soon form -- as highlighted in orange hues and imaged by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.  The infrared light tracks enormous lanes of dust, warmed by stars, sweeping along Andromeda's spiral arms.  This dust is a tracer of the galaxy's vast interstellar gas -- the raw material for future star formation.  These new stars will likely form over the next hundred million years, surely well before Andromeda merges with our Milky Way Galaxy in about 5 billion years.","future, star, andromeda, picture, show, course, beautiful, galaxy, spiral, mere, light-year, space-based, ground-based, observatory, combined, produce, intriguing, composite, image, visible, light, highlighted, white, blue, imaged, hubble, subaru, mayall, telescope, infrared, form, orange, nasa, spitzer, space, enormous, lane, dust, warmed, sweeping, tracer, vast, interstellar, material, formation, likely, next, year, merges, milky"
A Deep Sky Behind an Eclipsed Moon,"The plan was to capture a picturesque part of the sky that was hosting an unusual guest.  The result included a bonus — an additional and unexpected guest. The beautiful background features part of the central band of our Milky Way galaxy on the far left, and the colorful clouds of Rho Ophiuchi in the image center. The unusual guest, a dimmed and reddened Moon on the right, was expected because the image was taken during last week’s total lunar eclipse. The timing had to be right because the Moon — both before and after eclipse — would be so bright it would overwhelm the background.  The unexpected guest was the bright meteor across the image center. The fleeting meteor streak was captured on only one of the 10 consecutively-captured deep-field images from La Palma in the Spanish Canary Islands, while the eclipsed Moon image was taken immediately afterwards with the same camera and from the same location. The next total lunar eclipse — also quite expected — will occur in early November.

The Lively Center of the Lagoon Nebula,"The center of the Lagoon Nebula is a whirlwind of spectacular star formation. Visible near the image center, at least two long funnel-shaped clouds, each roughly half a light-year long, have been formed by extreme stellar winds and intense energetic starlight.  A tremendously bright nearby star, Herschel 36, lights the area.  Vast walls of dust hide and redden other hot young stars.  As energy from these stars pours into the cool dust and gas, large temperature differences in adjoining regions can be created generating shearing winds which may cause the funnels.  This picture, spanning about 10 light years, combines images taken in six colors by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.

NGC 4565: Galaxy on Edge,"Magnificent spiral galaxy NGC 4565 is viewed edge-on from planet Earth. Also known as the Needle Galaxy for its narrow profile, bright NGC 4565 is a stop on many telescopic tours of the northern sky, in the faint but well-groomed constellation Coma Berenices. This sharp, colorful image reveals the galaxy's boxy, bulging central core cut by obscuring dust lanes that lace NGC 4565's thin galactic plane. NGC 4565 itself lies about 40 million light-years distant and spans some 100,000 light-years.

Titan: Moon over Saturn,"Like Earth's moon, Saturn's largest moon Titan is locked in synchronous rotation. This mosaic of images recorded by the Cassini spacecraft in May of 2012 shows its anti-Saturn side, the side always facing away from the ringed gas giant. The only moon in the solar system with a dense atmosphere, Titan is the only solar system world besides Earth known to have standing bodies of liquid on its surface and an earthlike cycle of liquid rain and evaporation. Its high altitude layer of atmospheric haze is evident in the Cassini view of the 5,000 kilometer diameter moon over Saturn's rings and cloud tops. Near center is the dark dune-filled region known as Shangri-La. The Cassini-delivered Huygens probe rests below and left of center, after the most distant landing for a spacecraft from Earth.","titan, moon, saturn, earth, largest, locked, synchronous, rotation, mosaic, image, recorded, cassini, spacecraft, 2012, show, anti-saturn, side, facing, ringed, giant, solar, system, dense, world, known, standing, body, liquid, surface, cycle, rain, evaporation, high, altitude, layer, atmospheric, haze, evident, view, kilometer, diameter, ring, cloud, center, dark, dune-filled, region, shangri-la, cassini-delivered, huygens, probe, rest, left, distant, landing"
RCW 86: Historical Supernova Remnant,"In 185 AD, Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of a new star in the Nanmen asterism. That part of the sky is identified with Alpha and Beta Centauri on modern star charts. The new star was visible for months and is thought to be the earliest recorded supernova. This deep image shows emission nebula RCW 86, understood to be the remnant of that stellar explosion. The narrowband data trace gas ionized by the still expanding shock wave. Space-based images indicate an abundance of the element iron and lack of a neutron star or pulsar in the remnant, suggesting that the original supernova was Type Ia. Unlike the core collapse supernova explosion of a massive star, a Type Ia supernova is a thermonuclear detonation on a a white dwarf star that accretes material from a companion in a binary star system. Near the plane of our Milky Way galaxy and larger than a full moon on the sky this supernova remnant is too faint to be seen by eye though. RCW 86 is some 8,000 light-years distant and around 100 light-years across.","historical, supernova, remnant, chinese, astronomer, recorded, star, nanmen, asterism, part, identified, alpha, beta, centauri, modern, chart, visible, month, thought, deep, image, show, emission, understood, stellar, explosion, narrowband, data, trace, ionized, expanding, shock, wave, space-based, indicate, abundance, element, iron, lack, neutron, pulsar, suggesting, original, type, core, collapse, massive, thermonuclear, detonation, white, dwarf, accretes, material, companion, binary, system, plane, milky, galaxy, larger, full, moon, faint, seen, light-year, distant"
Simulation TNG50: A Galaxy Cluster Forms,"How do clusters of galaxies form?  Since our universe moves too slowly to watch, faster-moving computer simulations are created to help find out. A recent effort is TNG50 from IllustrisTNG, an upgrade of the famous Illustris Simulation. The first part of the featured video tracks cosmic gas (mostly hydrogen) as it evolves into galaxies and galaxy clusters from the early universe to today, with brighter colors marking faster moving gas.  As the universe matures, gas falls into gravitational wells, galaxies forms, galaxies spin, galaxies collide and merge, all while black holes form in galaxy centers and expel surrounding gas at high speeds. The second half of the video switches to tracking stars, showing a galaxy cluster coming together complete with tidal tails and stellar streams. The outflow from black holes in TNG50 is surprisingly complex and details are being compared with our real universe.  Studying how gas coalesced in the early universe helps humanity better understand how our Earth, Sun, and Solar System originally formed.","simulation, tng50, galaxy, cluster, form, universe, move, faster-moving, computer, created, help, find, recent, effort, illustristng, upgrade, famous, illustris, first, part, featured, video, track, cosmic, hydrogen, evolves, early, today, brighter, color, marking, moving, matures, fall, gravitational, spin, collide, merge, black, hole, center, expel, surrounding, high, speed, second, half, switch, tracking, star, showing, coming, complete, tidal, tail, stellar, stream, complex, detail, compared, real, studying, coalesced, humanity, understand, earth, solar, system, formed"
Red Crepuscular Rays from an Eclipse,"What's happening behind that island? Things both expected and unexpected. Expected, perhaps, the pictured rays of light -- called crepuscular rays -- originate from the Sun. Unexpected, though, the Sun was being partially eclipsed by the Moon at the time -- late last month. Expected, perhaps, the Sun's rays are quite bright as they shine through gaps in below-horizon clouds. Unexpected, though, the crepuscular rays are quite red, likely the result an abundance of aerosols in Earth's atmosphere scattering away much of the blue light.  Expected, with hope, a memorable scene featuring both the Moon and the Sun, superposed. Unfortunately, from this location -- in Uruguay looking toward Argentina -- clouds obscured the eclipse -- which wasn't completely unexpected.  However, after packing up to go home, the beauty of bright red crepuscular rays emerged -- quite unexpectedly.  Oh -- and that island on the horizon -- it's really two islands.","crepuscular, eclipse, happening, island, thing, expected, unexpected, pictured, light, called, originate, eclipsed, moon, time, late, last, month, bright, shine, below-horizon, cloud, likely, result, abundance, aerosol, earth, atmosphere, scattering, much, blue, hope, memorable, scene, featuring, superposed, location, uruguay, looking, argentina, obscured, packing, home, beauty, emerged, horizon"
Rocket Transits Rippling Sun,"The launch of a rocket at sunrise can result in unusual but intriguing images that feature both the rocket and the Sun. Such was the case last month when a SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket blasted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center carrying 53 more Starlink satellites into low Earth orbit. In the featured launch picture, the rocket's exhaust plume glows beyond its projection onto the distant Sun, the rocket itself appears oddly jagged, and the Sun's lower edge shows peculiar drip-like ripples. The physical cause of all of these effects is pockets of relatively hot or rarefied air deflecting sunlight less strongly than pockets relatively cool or compressed air: refraction.  Unaware of the Earthly show, active sunspot region 3014 -- on the upper left -- slowly crosses the Sun.","rocket, transit, rippling, launch, sunrise, result, unusual, intriguing, image, feature, case, last, month, spacex, blasted, nasa, kennedy, space, center, carrying, starlink, earth, orbit, featured, picture, exhaust, plume, glow, projection, distant, appears, jagged, lower, edge, show, peculiar, drip-like, ripple, physical, cause, effect, pocket, rarefied, deflecting, sunlight, less, cool, compressed, refraction, unaware, active, sunspot, region, upper, left, cross"
Tau Herculid Meteors over Kitt Peak Telescopes,"It wasn't the storm of the century -- but it was a night to remember. Last night was the peak of the Tau Herculid meteor shower, a usually modest dribble of occasional meteors originating from the disintegrating Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3. This year, calculations showed that the Earth might be passing through a particularly dense stream of comet debris -- at best creating a storm of bright meteors streaking out from the constellation of Hercules. What actually happened fell short of a meteor storm, but could be called a decent meteor shower. Featured here is a composite image taken at Kitt Peak National Observatory in Arizona, USA accumulated over 2.5 hours very late on May 30.  Over that time, 19 Tau Herculids meteors were captured, along with 4 unrelated meteors. (Can you find them?)  In the near foreground is the Bok 2.3-meter Telescope with the 4.0-meter Mayall Telescope just behind it. Next year, the annual Tau Herculids are expected to return to its normal low rate, with the next active night forecast for 2049.","herculid, meteor, kitt, peak, telescope, storm, century, night, remember, last, shower, modest, dribble, occasional, originating, disintegrating, comet, year, calculation, showed, earth, passing, dense, stream, debris, best, creating, bright, streaking, constellation, hercules, happened, fell, short, called, decent, featured, composite, image, taken, national, observatory, arizona, accumulated, hour, time, herculids, captured, unrelated, find, near, foreground, 2.3-meter, mayall, next, annual, expected, return, normal, rate, active, forecast"
Lunar Occultation of Venus,"On May 27 Venus rose as the morning star, near the waning crescent Moon in a predawn sky already full of planets. It was close on the sky to the Moon's crescent and a conjunction of the second and third brightest celestial beacons was enjoyed by skygazers around the world. But seen from locations along a track through southeast Asia and the Indian Ocean the Moon actually passed in front of Venus in a lunar occultation. In this animated gif the 75 percent illuminated disk of Venus approaches and just begins to disappear behind the sunlit southwestern lunar limb. The telescopic frames used to construct it were captured from Reunion Island in the Indian Ocean around 4:50am local time, with the Moon and Venus very close to the eastern horizon. At the time Venus was over 180 million kilometers from Reunion Island, compared to a lunar distance of a mere 400 thousand kilometers or so. About 50 minutes later Venus emerged from behind the Moon.","lunar, occultation, venus, rose, morning, star, waning, crescent, moon, predawn, full, planet, conjunction, second, third, brightest, celestial, beacon, enjoyed, skygazers, world, seen, location, track, southeast, asia, indian, ocean, passed, front, animated, percent, illuminated, disk, approach, begin, disappear, sunlit, southwestern, limb, telescopic, frame, used, construct, captured, reunion, island, local, time, eastern, horizon, kilometer, compared, distance, thousand, minute, emerged"
"A 10,000 Kilometer Galactic Bridge","With this creative astro-collaboration you can follow the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy as it bridges northern and southern hemisphere skies. To construct the expansive composite nightscape, skies over Observatorio El Sauce in Chile (top) were imaged on the same date but 6 hours later than the skies over the Saint-Veran observatory in the French Alps. The 6 hour time-lag allowed Earth's rotation to align the Milky Way above domes at the two sites. All exposures were made with similar cameras and lenses mounted on simple tripods. A faint greenish airglow is visible in the dark Chilean sky that also features the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds near the observatory dome. In the French Alps light pollution is apparent, but the distant Andromeda Galaxy can still be spotted near the horizon in the northern night. On planet Earth the two observatories are separated by about 10,000 kilometers.","kilometer, galactic, bridge, creative, astro-collaboration, follow, plane, milky, galaxy, northern, southern, construct, expansive, composite, nightscape, observatorio, sauce, chile, imaged, date, hour, saint-veran, observatory, french, time-lag, allowed, earth, rotation, align, dome, site, exposure, made, similar, camera, lens, mounted, simple, tripod, faint, greenish, visible, dark, chilean, feature, large, small, magellanic, cloud, light, pollution, apparent, distant, andromeda, spotted, horizon, night, planet, separated"
Tau Herculids from Space,"On May 31 tens of parallel meteor streaks were recorded in this 8 degree wide field of view of planet Earth's limb from space. The image is one of a series of 5 minute long observations by the orbiting Yangwang-1 space telescope. It was captured at 03:43 UT, near the peak of the Tau Herculid meteor shower. As predicted, the meteor shower was an active one this year, caused as Earth swept through a relatively dense stream of debris from disintegrating Comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, but was lacking bright meteors. Nearly all of the Tau Herculid meteors in the Yangwang-1 image are too faint to be detected by groundbased instruments. But on that date patient earthbound skywatchers under clear skies still enjoyed a memorable showing of the Tau Herculids.","herculids, space, parallel, meteor, streak, recorded, degree, wide, field, view, planet, earth, limb, image, series, minute, long, observation, orbiting, yangwang-1, telescope, captured, peak, herculid, shower, predicted, active, year, caused, swept, dense, stream, debris, disintegrating, comet, 73p/schwassmann-wachmann, lacking, bright, faint, detected, groundbased, instrument, date, patient, earthbound, skywatchers, clear, enjoyed, memorable, showing"
Two Black Holes Dancing in 3C 75,"What's happening at the center of active galaxy 3C 75?  The two bright sources at the center of this composite x-ray (blue)/ radio (pink) image are co-orbiting supermassive black holes powering the giant radio source 3C 75. Surrounded by multimillion degree x-ray emitting gas, and blasting out jets of relativistic particles the supermassive black holes are separated by 25,000 light-years. At the cores of two merging galaxies in the Abell 400 galaxy cluster they are some 300 million light-years away. Astronomers conclude that these two supermassive black holes are bound together by gravity in a binary system in part because the jets' consistent swept back appearance is most likely due to their common motion as they speed through the hot cluster gas at about 1200 kilometers per second. Such spectacular cosmic mergers are thought to be common in crowded galaxy cluster environments in the distant universe. In their final stages, the mergers are expected to be intense sources of gravitational waves.","black, hole, dancing, happening, center, active, galaxy, bright, source, composite, x-ray, blue, radio, pink, image, co-orbiting, supermassive, powering, giant, surrounded, multimillion, degree, emitting, blasting, relativistic, particle, separated, light-year, core, merging, astronomer, conclude, gravity, binary, system, part, consistent, swept, appearance, likely, common, motion, speed, cluster, kilometer, second, spectacular, cosmic, merger, thought, crowded, environment, distant, universe, final, stage, expected, intense, gravitational, wave"
Milky Way Galaxy Doomed: Collision with Andromeda Pending,"Will our Milky Way Galaxy collide one day with its larger neighbor, the Andromeda Galaxy? Most likely, yes.  Careful plotting of slight displacements of M31's stars relative to background galaxies on recent Hubble Space Telescope images indicate that the center of M31 could be on a direct collision course with the center of our home galaxy. Still, the errors in sideways velocity appear sufficiently large to admit a good chance that the central parts of the two galaxies will miss, slightly, but will become close enough for their outer halos to become gravitationally entangled. Once that happens, the two galaxies will become bound, dance around, and eventually merge to become one large elliptical galaxy -- over the next few billion years. Pictured here is a combination of images depicting the sky of a world (Earth?) in the distant future when the outer parts of each galaxy begin to collide. The exact future of our Milky Way and the entire surrounding Local Group of Galaxies is likely to remain an active topic of research for years to come.","milky, galaxy, doomed, collision, andromeda, pending, collide, larger, neighbor, likely, careful, plotting, slight, displacement, star, relative, background, recent, hubble, space, telescope, image, indicate, center, direct, course, home, error, sideways, velocity, appear, large, admit, good, chance, central, part, miss, become, close, enough, outer, halo, entangled, happens, bound, dance, merge, elliptical, next, year, pictured, combination, depicting, world, earth, distant, future, begin, exact, entire, surrounding, local, group, remain, active, topic, research, come"
NGC 6188: Dragons of Ara,"Do dragons fight on the altar of the sky?  Although it might appear that way, these dragons are illusions made of thin gas and dust. The emission nebula NGC 6188, home to the glowing clouds, is found about 4,000 light years away near the edge of a large molecular cloud unseen at visible wavelengths, in the southern constellation Ara (the Altar). Massive, young stars of the embedded Ara OB1 association were formed in that region only a few million years ago, sculpting the dark shapes and powering the nebular glow with stellar winds and intense ultraviolet radiation. The recent star formation itself was likely triggered by winds and supernova explosions, from previous generations of massive stars, that swept up and compressed the molecular gas. Joining NGC 6188 on this cosmic canvas, visible toward the lower right, is rare emission nebula NGC 6164, also created by one of the region's massive O-type stars. Similar in appearance to many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164's striking, symmetric gaseous shroud and faint halo surround its bright central star near the bottom edge. This impressively wide field of view spans over 2 degrees (four full Moons), corresponding to over 150 light years at the estimated distance of NGC 6188.","dragon, fight, altar, appear, illusion, made, thin, dust, emission, nebula, home, glowing, cloud, found, light, year, edge, large, molecular, unseen, visible, wavelength, southern, constellation, massive, young, star, embedded, association, formed, region, sculpting, dark, shape, powering, nebular, glow, stellar, wind, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, recent, formation, triggered, supernova, explosion, previous, generation, swept, compressed, joining, cosmic, canvas, lower, right, rare, created, o-type, similar, appearance, many, planetary, striking, symmetric, gaseous, shroud, faint, halo, surround, bright, central, bottom, wide, field, view, span, degree, full, moon, corresponding, estimated, distance"
Ship Tracks over the Pacific Ocean,"What are those unusual streaks? Some images of planet Earth show clear bright streaks that follow the paths of ships.  Known as ship tracks, these low and narrow bands are caused by the ship's engine exhaust. Water vapor condenses around small bits of exhaust known as aerosols, which soon grow into floating water drops that efficiently reflect sunlight. Ship tracks were first discovered in 1965 in Earth images taken by NASA's TIROS satellites.  Multiple ship tracks are visible across the featured image that was captured in 2009 over the Pacific Ocean by the MODIS instrument on NASA's Terra satellite. Inspired by ship-tracks, some scientists have suggested deploying a network of floating buoys in the worlds' oceans that spray salt-aerosol containing sea-water into the air so that, with the help of the wind, streams of sunlight-reflecting clouds would also form.  Why do this?  These human-made clouds could reflect so much sunlight they might help fight global warming.

Cosmic Clouds in Cygnus,"These cosmic clouds of gas and dust drift through rich star fields along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the high flying constellation Cygnus. They're too faint to be seen with the unaided eye though, even on a clear, dark night. Image data from a camera and telephoto lens using narrowband filters was used to construct this 10 degree wide field of view. The deep mosaic reveals a region that includes star forming dust clouds seen in silhouette against the characteristic glow of atomic hydrogen and oxygen gas. NGC 6888 is the standout emission nebula near the top. Blown by winds from a massive Wolf-Rayet star it's about 25 light-years across and known as the Crescent Nebula. A faint bluish curl just below center in the frame is also the signature of a Wolf-Rayet star.

Arp 286: Trio in Virgo,"This colorful telescopic field of view features a trio of interacting galaxies almost 90 million light-years away, toward the constellation Virgo. On the right two spiky, foreground Milky Way stars echo the extragalactic hues, a reminder that stars in our own galaxy are like those in distant island universes. With sweeping spiral arms and obscuring dust lanes, the dominant member of the trio, NGC 5566, is enormous, about 150,000 light-years across. Just above it lies smaller, bluish NGC 5569. Near center a third galaxy, NGC 5560, is apparently stretched and distorted by its interaction with massive NGC 5566. The trio is also included in Halton Arp's 1966 Atlas of Peculiar Galaxies as Arp 286. Of course, such cosmic interactions are now appreciated as part of the evolution of galaxies.","trio, virgo, colorful, telescopic, field, view, feature, interacting, galaxy, light-year, constellation, spiky, foreground, milky, star, echo, extragalactic, reminder, distant, island, universe, sweeping, spiral, obscuring, dust, lane, dominant, member, enormous, smaller, bluish, center, third, stretched, distorted, interaction, massive, included, halton, atlas, peculiar, course, cosmic, appreciated, part, evolution"
The Road and the Milky Way,"At night you can follow this road as it passes through the Dark Sky Alqueva reserve not too far from Alentejo, Portugal. Or you could stop, look up, and follow the Milky Way through the sky. Both stretch from horizon to horizon in this 180 degree panorama recorded on June 3. Our galaxy's name, the Milky Way, does refer to its appearance as a milky path in the sky. The word galaxy itself derives from the Greek for milk. From our fair planet the arc of the Milky Way is most easily visible on moonless nights from dark sky areas, though not quite so bright or colorful as in this image. The glowing celestial band is due to the collective light of myriad stars along the galactic plane too faint to be distinguished individually. The diffuse starlight is cut by dark swaths of the galaxy's obscuring interstellar dust clouds. Standing above the Milky Way arc near the top of this panoramic nightscape is bright star Vega, with the galaxy's central bulge near the horizon at the right.","road, milky, night, follow, pass, dark, alqueva, reserve, alentejo, portugal, stop, look, stretch, horizon, degree, panorama, recorded, june, galaxy, name, refer, appearance, path, word, derives, greek, milk, fair, planet, visible, moonless, area, bright, colorful, image, glowing, celestial, band, collective, light, myriad, star, galactic, plane, faint, distinguished, diffuse, starlight, swath, obscuring, interstellar, dust, cloud, standing, panoramic, nightscape, vega, central, bulge, right"
Find the Man in the Moon,"Have you ever seen the Man in the Moon? This common question plays on the ability of humans to see pareidolia -- imagining familiar icons where they don't actually exist. The textured surface of Earth's full Moon is home to numerous identifications of iconic objects, not only in modern western culture but in world folklore throughout history. Examples, typically dependent on the Moon's perceived orientation, include the Woman in the Moon and the Rabbit in the Moon. One facial outline commonly identified as the Man in the Moon starts by imagining the two dark circular areas -- lunar maria -- here just above the Moon's center, to be the eyes.  Surprisingly, there actually is a man in this Moon image -- a close look will reveal a real person -- with a telescope -- silhouetted against the Moon. This featured well-planned image was taken in 2016 in Cadalso de los Vidrios in Madrid, Spain.

M51: The Whirlpool Galaxy from Hubble,"The Whirlpool Galaxy is a classic spiral galaxy. At only 30 million light years distant and fully 60 thousand light years across, M51, also known as NGC 5194, is one of the brightest and most picturesque galaxies on the sky.  The featured image is a digital combination of images taken in different colors by the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope, highlighting many sharp features. Anyone with a good pair of binoculars, however, can see this Whirlpool toward the constellation of the Hunting Dogs (Canes Venatici). M51 is a spiral galaxy of type Sc and is the dominant member of a whole group of galaxies.  Astronomers speculate that M51's spiral structure is primarily due to its gravitational interaction with the smaller galaxy on the image left.","whirlpool, galaxy, hubble, classic, spiral, light, year, distant, thousand, known, brightest, picturesque, featured, image, digital, combination, taken, different, color, earth-orbiting, space, telescope, highlighting, many, sharp, feature, anyone, good, pair, binoculars, constellation, hunting, cane, venatici, type, dominant, member, whole, group, astronomer, speculate, structure, gravitational, interaction, smaller, left"
Satellites Behind Pinnacles,"What are all those streaks across the background? Satellite trails. First, the foreground features picturesque rock mounds known as Pinnacles.  Found in the Nambung National Park in Western Australia, these human-sized spires are made by unknown processes from ancient sea shells (limestone). Perhaps more eye-catching, though, is the sky behind. Created by low-Earth orbit satellites reflecting sunlight, all of these streaks were captured in less than two hours and digitally combined onto the single featured image, with the foreground taken consecutively by the same camera and from the same location.  Most of the streaks were made by the developing Starlink constellation of communication satellites, but some are not. In general, the streaks are indicative of an increasing number of satellites nearly continuously visible above the Earth after dusk and before dawn.  Understanding and removing the effects of satellite trails on images from Earth's ground-based cameras and telescopes is now important not only for elegant astrophotography, but for humanity's scientific understanding of the distant universe.

In the Heart of the Virgo Cluster,"The Virgo Cluster of Galaxies is the closest cluster of galaxies to our Milky Way Galaxy.  The Virgo Cluster is so close that it spans more than 5 degrees on the sky - about 10 times the angle made by a full Moon. With its heart lying about 70 million light years distant, the Virgo Cluster is the nearest cluster of galaxies, contains over 2,000 galaxies, and has a noticeable gravitational pull on the galaxies of the Local Group of Galaxies surrounding our Milky Way Galaxy.  The cluster contains not only galaxies filled with stars but also gas so hot it glows in X-rays.  Motions of galaxies in and around clusters indicate that they contain more dark matter than any visible matter we can see.  Pictured here, the heart of the Virgo Cluster includes bright Messier galaxies such as Markarian's Eyes on the upper left, M86 just to the upper right of center, M84 on the far right, as well as spiral galaxy NGC 4388 at the bottom right.

Strawberry Supermoon from China,"There are four Full Supermoons in 2022. Using the definition of a supermoon as a Full Moon near perigee, that is within at least 90% of its closest approach to Earth in a given orbit, the year's Full Supermoon dates are May 16, June 14, July 13, and August 12. Full Moons near perigee really are the brightest and largest in planet Earth's sky. But size and brightness differences between Full Moons are relatively small and an actual comparison with other Full Moons is difficult to make by eye alone.  Two exposures are blended in this supermoon and sky view from June 14. That Full Moon was also known to northern hemisphere skygazers as the Strawberry moon. The consecutive short and long exposures allow familiar features on the fully sunlit lunar nearside to be seen in the same image as a faint lunar corona and an atmospheric cloudscape. They were captured in skies over Chongqing, China.","strawberry, supermoon, china, full, supermoons, using, definition, moon, perigee, least, closest, approach, earth, given, year, date, june, july, august, largest, planet, size, brightness, difference, small, actual, comparison, difficult, make, exposure, blended, view, known, hemisphere, skygazers, consecutive, short, long, allow, familiar, feature, sunlit, lunar, seen, image, faint, corona, atmospheric, cloudscape, captured, chongqing"
Good Morning Planets from Chile,"On June 15, innermost planet Mercury had wandered about as far from the Sun as it ever gets in planet Earth's sky. Near the eastern horizon just before sunrise it stands over distant Andes mountain peaks in this predawn snapshot from the valley of Rio Hurtado in Chile. June's other morning planets are arrayed above it, as all the naked-eye planets of the Solar System stretch in a line along the ecliptic in the single wide-field view. Tilted toward the north, the Solar System's ecliptic plane arcs steeply through southern hemisphere skies. Northern hemisphere early morning risers will see the lineup of planets along the ecliptic at a shallower angle tilting toward the south. From both hemispheres June's beautiful morning planetary display finds the visible planets in order of their increasing distance from the Sun.","good, morning, planet, chile, june, innermost, mercury, wandered, earth, eastern, horizon, sunrise, stand, distant, andes, mountain, peak, predawn, snapshot, valley, hurtado, arrayed, naked-eye, solar, system, stretch, line, ecliptic, single, wide-field, view, tilted, north, plane, steeply, southern, northern, early, riser, lineup, shallower, angle, tilting, south, beautiful, planetary, display, find, visible, order, increasing, distance"
The Gamma Cygni Nebula,"Supergiant star Gamma Cygni is at the center of the Northern Cross. Near the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, that famous asterism flies high in northern summer night skies in the constellation Cygnus the Swan. Known by the proper name Sadr, Gamma Cygni also lies just below center in this telescopic skyscape, with colors mapped from both broadband and narrowband image data. The field of view spans about 3 degrees (six Full Moons) on the sky and includes emission nebula IC 1318 and open star cluster NGC 6910. Filling the upper part of the frame and shaped like two glowing cosmic wings divided by a long dark dust lane, IC 1318's popular name is understandably the Butterfly Nebula. Right of Gamma Cygni, are the young, still tightly grouped stars of NGC 6910. The distance to Gamma Cygni is around 560 parsecs or 1,800 light-years.

Game: Super Planet Crash,"Can you create a planetary system that lasts for 1000 years? Super Planet Crash, the featured game, allows you to try.  To create up to ten planets, just click anywhere near the central star.  Planet types can be selected on the left in order of increasing mass: Earth, Super-Earth, Ice giant, Giant planet, Brown dwarf, or Dwarf star. Each planet is gravitationally attracted not only to the central Sun-like star, but to other planets. Points are awarded, with bonus factors applied for increasingly crowded and habitable systems. The game ends after 1000 years or when a planet is gravitationally expelled. Many exoplanetary systems are being discovered in recent years, and Super Planet Crash demonstrates why some remain stable.  As you might suspect after playing Super Planet Crash a few times, there is reason to believe that our own Solar System has lost planets during its formation.","game, super, planet, crash, create, planetary, system, last, year, featured, allows, click, central, star, type, selected, left, order, increasing, mass, earth, super-earth, giant, brown, dwarf, attracted, sun-like, point, awarded, bonus, factor, applied, crowded, habitable, expelled, many, exoplanetary, discovered, recent, demonstrates, remain, stable, suspect, playing, time, reason, believe, solar, lost, formation"
Rock Fingers on Mars,"There, just right of center, what is that? The surface of Mars keeps revealing new surprises with the recent discovery of finger-like rock spires. The small nearly-vertical rock outcrops were imaged last month by the robotic Curiosity rover on Mars. Although similar in size and shape to small snakes, the leading explanation for their origin is as conglomerations of small minerals left by water flowing through rock crevices. After these relatively dense minerals filled the crevices, they were left behind when the surrounding rock eroded away.  Famous rock outcrops on Earth with a similar origin are called hoodoos.

Analemma over Taipei,"Does the Sun return to the same spot on the sky every day? No.  A better and more visual answer to that question is an analemma, a composite of images taken at the same time and from the same place over the course of a year. The featured analemma was compiled at 4:30 pm many afternoons from Taiwan during 2021, with the city skyline of Taipei in the foreground, including tall Taipei 101. The Sun's location in December -- at the December solstice -- is shown on the far left, while its location at the June solstice is captured on the far right. Also shown are the positions of the Sun throughout the rest of the day on the solstices and equinoxes.

Supernova Remnant: The Veil Nebula,"Ten thousand years ago, before the dawn of recorded human history, a new light would have suddenly have appeared in the night sky and faded after a few weeks.  Today we know this light was from a supernova, or exploding star, and record the expanding debris cloud as the Veil Nebula, a supernova remnant.  Imaged with color filters featuring light emitted by sulfur (red), hydrogen (green), and oxygen (blue), this deep wide-angle view was processed to remove the stars and so better capture the impressive glowing filaments of the Veil.  Also known as the Cygnus Loop, the Veil Nebula is roughly circular in shape and covers nearly 3 degrees on the sky toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus). Famous nebular sections include the Bat Nebula, the Witch's Broom Nebula, and Fleming's Triangular Wisp.  The complete supernova remnant lies about 1,400 light-years away.","supernova, remnant, veil, year, dawn, recorded, human, history, light, appeared, night, faded, week, today, know, exploding, star, record, expanding, debris, cloud, nebula, imaged, color, filter, featuring, emitted, sulfur, hydrogen, green, oxygen, blue, deep, wide-angle, view, processed, remove, capture, impressive, glowing, filament, known, cygnus, loop, circular, shape, cover, degree, constellation, swan, famous, nebular, section, include, witch, broom, fleming, triangular, wisp, complete, light-year"
Spiral Galaxy NGC 6744,"Beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 6744 is nearly 175,000 light-years across, larger than our own Milky Way. It lies some 30 million light-years distant in the southern constellation Pavo but appears as only a faint, extended object in small telescopes. We see the disk of the nearby island universe tilted towards our line of sight in this remarkably detailed galaxy portrait, a telescopic view that spans an area about the angular size of a full moon. In it, the giant galaxy's elongated yellowish core is dominated by the light from old, cool stars. Beyond the core, grand spiral arms are filled with young blue star clusters and speckled with pinkish star forming regions. An extended arm sweeps past smaller satellite galaxy NGC 6744A at the lower right.

Filaprom on the Western Limb,"A solar filament is an enormous stream of incandescent plasma suspended above the active surface of the Sun by looping magnetic fields. Seen against the solar disk it looks dark only because it's a little cooler, and so slightly dimmer, than the solar photosphere. Suspended above the solar limb the same structure looks bright when viewed against the blackness of space and is called a solar prominence. A filaprom would be both of course, a stream of magnetized plasma that crosses in front of the solar disk and extends beyond the Sun's edge. In this hydrogen-alpha close-up of the Sun captured on June 22, active region AR3038 is near the center of the frame. Active region AR3032 is seen at the far right, close to the Sun's western limb. As AR3032 is carried by rotation toward the Sun's visible edge, what was once a giant filament above it is now partly seen as a prominence, How big is AR3032's filaprom?

That foggy morning found innermost planet Mercury close to the horizon but just visible against the twilight, below and left of brilliant Venus. Along with the waning crescent Moon, the other bright naked-eye planets, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn lie near the ecliptic, arcing up and to the right across the wide field of view.

Light Echoes from V838 Mon,"What caused this outburst of V838 Mon?  For reasons unknown, star V838 Mon's outer surface suddenly greatly expanded with the result that it became one of the brighter stars in the  Milky Way Galaxy in early 2002.  Then, just as suddenly, it shrunk and faded.  A stellar flash like this had never been seen before -- supernovas and novas expel matter out into space.  Although the V838 Mon flash appears to expel material into space, what is seen in the featured image from the Hubble Space Telescope is actually an outwardly expanding light echo of the original flash.  In a light echo, light from the flash is reflected by successively more distant surfaces in the complex array of ambient interstellar dust that already surrounded the star.  V838 Mon lies about 20,000 light years away toward the constellation of the unicorn (Monoceros), while the light echo above spans about six light years in diameter.","light, echo, v838, caused, outburst, reason, unknown, star, outer, surface, expanded, result, became, brighter, milky, galaxy, early, shrunk, faded, stellar, flash, seen, supernova, nova, expel, matter, space, appears, material, featured, image, hubble, telescope, expanding, original, reflected, distant, complex, array, ambient, interstellar, dust, surrounded, year, constellation, unicorn, monoceros, span, diameter"
The Gum Nebula over Snowy Mountains,"The Gum Nebula is so large and close it is actually hard to see. This interstellar expanse of glowing hydrogen gas frequently evades notice because it spans 35 degrees -- over 70 full Moons -- while much of it is quite dim. This featured spectacular 90-degree wide mosaic, however, was designed to be both wide and deep enough to bring up  the Gum -- visible in red on the right. The image was acquired late last year with both the foreground -- including Haba Snow Mountain -- and the background -- including the Milky Way's central band -- captured by the same camera and from the same location in Shangri-La, Yunnan, China. The Gum Nebula is so close that we are only about 450 light-years from the front edge, while about 1,500 light-years from the back edge. Named for a cosmic cloud hunter, Australian astronomer Colin Stanley Gum (1924-1960), the origin of this complex nebula is still being debated. A leading theory for the origin of the Gum Nebula is that  it is the remnant of a million year-old supernova explosion, while a competing theory holds that the Gum is a molecular cloud shaped over eons by multiple supernovas and the outflowing winds of several massive stars.","nebula, snowy, mountain, large, hard, interstellar, expanse, glowing, hydrogen, evades, notice, span, degree, full, moon, much, featured, spectacular, 90-degree, wide, mosaic, designed, bring, visible, right, image, acquired, last, year, foreground, including, haba, snow, background, milky, central, band, captured, camera, location, shangri-la, yunnan, china, light-year, front, edge, named, cosmic, cloud, hunter, australian, astronomer, colin, stanley, 1924-1960, origin, complex, debated, leading, theory, remnant, year-old, supernova, explosion, competing, hold, molecular, shaped, multiple, outflowing, several, massive, star"
Mercury from Passing BepiColombo,"Which part of the Moon is this?  No part -- because this is the planet Mercury.  Mercury's old surface is heavily cratered like that of Earth's Moon.  Mercury, while only slightly larger than Luna, is much denser and more massive than any Solar System moon because it is made mostly of iron.  In fact, our Earth is the only planet more dense.  Because Mercury rotates exactly three times for every two orbits around the Sun, and because Mercury's orbit is so elliptical, visitors on Mercury could see the Sun rise, stop in the sky, go back toward the rising horizon, stop again, and then set quickly over the other horizon.  From Earth, Mercury's proximity to the Sun causes it to be visible only for a short time just after sunset or just before sunrise. The featured image was captured last week by ESA and JAXA's passing BepiColombo spacecraft as it sheds energy and prepares to orbit the innermost planet starting in 2025.","mercury, passing, bepicolombo, part, moon, planet, surface, cratered, earth, larger, luna, massive, solar, system, made, iron, fact, dense, rotates, time, orbit, elliptical, visitor, rise, stop, rising, horizon, proximity, cause, visible, short, sunset, sunrise, featured, image, captured, last, week, jaxa, spacecraft, shed, energy, prepares, innermost, starting"
Solar System Family Portrait,"Yes, but have you ever seen all of the planets at once? A rare roll-call of planets has been occurring in the morning sky for much of June.  The featured fisheye all-sky image, taken a few mornings ago near the town of San Pedro de Atacama in Chile, caught not only the entire planet parade, but the Moon between Mars and Venus.  In order, left to right along the ecliptic plane, members of this Solar System family portrait are Earth, Saturn, Neptune, Jupiter, Mars, Uranus, Venus, Mercury, and Earth.  To emphasize their locations, Neptune and Uranus have been artificially enhanced. The volcano just below Mercury is Licancabur. In July, Mercury will move into the Sun's glare but reappear a few days later on the evening side.  Then, in August, Saturn will drift past the direction opposite the Sun and so become visible at dusk instead of dawn.  The next time that all eight planets will be simultaneously visible in the evening sky will be in 2122.

Comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS),"Imaged on June 20 2022, comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) shares this wide telescopic field of view with open star cluster IC 4665 and bright star Beta Ophiuchi, near a starry edge of the Milky Way. On its maiden voyage to the inner Solar System from the dim and distant Oort cloud, this comet PanSTARRS was initially spotted over five years ago, in May 2017. Then it was the most distant active inbound comet ever found, discovered when it was some 2.4 billion kilometers from the Sun. That put it between the orbital distances of Uranus and Saturn. Hubble Space Telescope observations indicated the comet had a large nucleus less than 18 kilometers in diameter.  Now visible in small telescopes C/2017 K2 will make its closest approach to planet Earth on July 14 and closest approach to the Sun this December. Its extended coma and developing tail are seen here at a distance of some 290 million kilometers, a mere 16 light-minutes away.","comet, c/2017, panstarrs, imaged, june, share, wide, telescopic, field, view, open, star, cluster, bright, beta, ophiuchi, starry, edge, milky, maiden, voyage, inner, solar, system, distant, oort, cloud, spotted, year, active, inbound, found, discovered, kilometer, orbital, distance, uranus, saturn, hubble, space, telescope, observation, indicated, large, nucleus, diameter, visible, small, make, closest, approach, planet, earth, december, extended, coma, developing, tail, seen, mere, light-minutes"
The Solar System's Planet Trails,"Stars trail through a clear morning sky in this postcard from a rotating planet. The timelapse image is constructed from consecutive exposures made over nearly three hours with a camera fixed to a tripod beside the Forbidden City in Beijing, China on June 24. Arcing above the eastern horizon after the series of exposures began, a waning crescent Moon left the brightest streak and watery reflection. On that date the planets of the Solar System were also lined up along the ecliptic and left their own trails before sunrise.  Saturn was first to rise on that morning and the ringed planet's trail starts close to the top right edge, almost out of the frame. Innermost planet Mercury rose only just before the Sun though. It left the shortest trail, visible against the twilight near the horizon at the far left. Uranus and Neptune are faint and hard to find, but mingled with the star trails the Solar System's planet trails are all labeled in the scene.","solar, system, planet, trail, star, clear, morning, postcard, rotating, timelapse, image, constructed, consecutive, exposure, made, hour, camera, fixed, tripod, beside, forbidden, city, beijing, china, arcing, eastern, horizon, series, began, waning, crescent, moon, left, brightest, streak, watery, reflection, date, lined, ecliptic, sunrise, saturn, rise, ringed, start, right, edge, frame, innermost, mercury, rose, shortest, visible, twilight, uranus, neptune, faint, hard, find, mingled, labeled, scene"
Solargraphic Analemmas,"For the northern hemisphere June 21 was the summer solstice, the Sun reaching its northernmost declination for the year. That would put it at the top of each of these three figure-8 curves, or analemmas, as it passed through the daytime sky over the village of Proboszczow, Poland. No sequence of digital exposures was used to construct the remarkable image though. Using a pinhole camera fixed to face south during the period June 26, 2021 to June 26, 2022, the image was formed directly on a single sheet of photographic paper, a technique known as solargraphy.

Phobos: Doomed Moon of Mars,"This moon is doomed. Mars, the red planet named for the Roman god of war, has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, whose names are derived from the Greek for Fear and Panic. These martian moons may well be captured asteroids originating in the main asteroid belt between Mars and Jupiter or perhaps from even more distant reaches of our Solar System. The larger moon, Phobos, is indeed seen to be a cratered, asteroid-like object in this stunning color image from the robotic Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter, with objects as small as 10 meters visible. But Phobos orbits so close to Mars - about 5,800 kilometers above the surface compared to 400,000 kilometers for our Moon - that gravitational tidal forces are dragging it down. In perhaps 50 million years, Phobos is expected to disintegrate into a ring of debris.","phobos, doomed, moon, planet, named, roman, tiny, deimos, name, derived, greek, fear, panic, martian, captured, originating, main, asteroid, belt, jupiter, distant, reach, solar, system, larger, seen, cratered, asteroid-like, object, stunning, color, image, robotic, reconnaissance, orbiter, small, meter, visible, orbit, close, kilometer, surface, compared, gravitational, tidal, force, dragging, year, expected, disintegrate, ring, debris"
Strawberry Supermoon Over Devil's Saddle,"Near the horizon the full moon often seems to loom large, swollen in appearance by the famous Moon illusion. But time-lapse image sequences demonstrate that the Moon's angular size doesn't really change as it rises or sets. Its color does, though. Recording a frame about every 60 seconds, this image also shows how red the Sun can look while low on the horizon. The featured montage was taken from Cagliari, Sardinia, Italy, the day after June's Strawberry Moon, a full moon dubbed a supermoon due to its slightly larger-than-usual angular size.  This Strawberry Supermoon is seen rising behind the Devil's Saddle, a mountain named for the unusual moon-sized dip seen just to the right of the rising moon. A shrinking line-of-sight through planet Earth's dense and dusty atmosphere shifted the moonlight from strawberry red through honey-colored and paler yellowish hues. That change seems appropriate for a northern June Full Moon also known as the Strawberry or Honey Moon. A Thunder Supermoon -- the third of four supermoons in 2022 -- will occur later this month.

A Molten Galaxy Einstein Ring,"It is difficult to hide a galaxy behind a cluster of galaxies.  The closer cluster's gravity will act like a huge lens, pulling images of the distant galaxy around the sides and greatly distorting them.  This is just the case observed in the featured image recently re-processed image from the Hubble Space Telescope.  The cluster GAL-CLUS-022058c is composed of many galaxies and is  lensing the image of a yellow-red background galaxy into arcs seen around the image center.  Dubbed a molten Einstein ring for its unusual shape, four images of the same background galaxy have been identified. Typically, a foreground galaxy cluster can only create such smooth arcs if most of its mass is smoothly distributed -- and therefore not concentrated in the cluster galaxies visible.  Analyzing the positions of these gravitational arcs gives astronomers a method to estimate the dark matter distribution in galaxy clusters, as well as infer when the stars in these early galaxies began to form.

Milky Way Motion in 3D from Gaia,"Our sky is alive with the streams of stars.  The motions of 26 million Milky Way stars are evident in the featured map constructed from recent data taken by ESA's Gaia satellite. Stars colored blue are moving toward us, while red indicates away. Lines depict the motion of the stars across the sky. The large blue areas on the left and red areas on the map's right give the overall impression that stars in the Milky Way are rotating around the center.

The NGC 6914 Complex,"A study in contrasts, this colorful skyscape features stars, dust, and glowing gas in the vicinity of NGC 6914. The interstellar complex of nebulae lies some 6,000 light-years away, toward the high-flying northern constellation Cygnus and the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. Obscuring interstellar dust clouds appear in silhouette while reddish hydrogen emission nebulae, along with the dusty blue reflection nebulae, fill the cosmic canvas. Ultraviolet radiation from the massive, hot, young stars of the extensive Cygnus OB2 association ionize the region's atomic hydrogen gas, producing the characteristic red glow as protons and electrons recombine. Embedded Cygnus OB2 stars also provide the blue starlight strongly reflected by the dust clouds. The over 1 degree wide telescopic field of view spans about 100 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 6914.","complex, study, contrast, colorful, skyscape, feature, star, dust, glowing, vicinity, interstellar, nebula, light-year, high-flying, northern, constellation, cygnus, plane, milky, galaxy, obscuring, cloud, appear, silhouette, reddish, hydrogen, emission, dusty, blue, reflection, fill, cosmic, canvas, ultraviolet, radiation, massive, young, extensive, association, ionize, region, atomic, producing, characteristic, glow, proton, electron, recombine, embedded, provide, starlight, reflected, degree, wide, telescopic, field, view, span, estimated, distance"
Roots on a Rotating Planet,"With roots on a rotating planet, an old tree is centered in this sequence of 137 exposures each 20 seconds long, recorded one night from northern Sicily. Digital camera and fisheye lens were fixed to a tripod to capture the dramatic timelapse, so the stars trailed through the region's dark sky. Of course that makes it easy to spot the planet's north celestial pole. The extension of Earth's axis of rotation into space is toward the upper left, at the center of the concentric star trail arcs. The Milky Way is there too. The plane of our galaxy stretches across the wide field of view from north to east (left to right) creating a broader luminous band of diffuse starlight.","root, rotating, planet, tree, centered, sequence, exposure, second, recorded, night, northern, digital, camera, fisheye, lens, fixed, tripod, capture, dramatic, timelapse, star, trailed, region, dark, course, make, easy, spot, north, celestial, pole, extension, earth, axis, rotation, space, upper, left, center, concentric, trail, milky, plane, galaxy, stretch, wide, field, view, east, right, creating, broader, luminous, band, diffuse, starlight"
Saturn and the ISS,"Soaring high in skies around planet Earth, bright planet Saturn was a star of June's morning planet parade. But very briefly on June 24 it posed with a bright object in low Earth orbit, the International Space Station. On that date from a school parking lot in Temecula, California the ringed-planet and International Space Station were both caught in this single high-speed video frame. Though Saturn was shining at +0.5 stellar magnitude the space station was an even brighter -3 on the magnitude scale. That difference in brightness is faithfully represented in the video capture frame. In the challenging image, the orbiting ISS was at a range of 602 kilometers. Saturn was about 1.4 billion kilometers from the school parking lot.","saturn, soaring, high, planet, earth, bright, star, june, morning, parade, briefly, posed, object, orbit, international, space, station, date, school, parking, california, ringed-planet, caught, single, high-speed, video, frame, shining, +0.5, stellar, magnitude, scale, difference, brightness, represented, capture, challenging, image, orbiting, range, kilometer"
In the Center of the Cat's Eye Nebula,"Three thousand light-years away, a dying star throws off shells of glowing gas. This image from the Hubble Space Telescope reveals the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543), to be one of the most complex planetary nebulae known. Spanning half a light-year, the features seen in the Cat's Eye are so complex that astronomers suspect the bright central object may actually be a binary star system. The term planetary nebula, used to describe this general class of objects, is misleading. Although these objects may appear round and planet-like in small telescopes, high resolution images with large telescopes reveal them to be stars surrounded by cocoons of gas blown off in the late stages of stellar evolution. Gazing into this Cat's Eye, astronomers may well be seeing more than detailed structure, they may be seeing the fate of our Sun, destined to enter its own planetary nebula phase of evolution ... in about 5 billion years.","center, thousand, light-year, dying, star, throw, shell, glowing, image, hubble, space, telescope, reveals, nebula, complex, planetary, known, spanning, half, feature, seen, astronomer, suspect, bright, central, object, binary, system, term, used, general, class, misleading, appear, planet-like, small, high, resolution, large, reveal, surrounded, cocoon, blown, late, stage, stellar, evolution, gazing, seeing, detailed, structure, fate, destined, phase, year"
Andromeda over the Sahara Desert,"What is the oldest thing you can see? At 2.5 million light years distant, the answer for the unaided eye is the Andromeda galaxy, because its photons are 2.5 million years old when they reach you. Most other apparent denizens of the night sky -- stars, clusters, and nebulae -- appear as they were only a few hundred to a few thousand years ago, as they lie well within our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Given its distance, light from Andromeda is likely also the farthest object that you can see.  Also known as M31, the Andromeda Galaxy dominates the center of the featured zoomed image, taken from the Sahara Desert in Morocco last month.  The featured image is a combination of three background and one foreground exposure -- all taken with the same camera and from the same location and on the same calendar day -- with the foreground image taken during the evening blue hour. M110, a satellite galaxy of Andromenda is visible just above and to the left of M31's core. As cool as it may be to see this neighboring galaxy to our Milky Way with your own eyes, long duration camera exposures can pick up many faint and breathtaking details.  Recent data indicates that our Milky Way Galaxy will collide and combine with the similarly-sized Andromeda galaxy in a few billion years.","andromeda, sahara, desert, oldest, thing, light, year, distant, answer, unaided, galaxy, reach, apparent, denizen, night, star, cluster, nebula, appear, milky, given, distance, farthest, object, known, dominates, center, featured, zoomed, image, taken, morocco, last, month, combination, foreground, exposure, camera, location, calendar, evening, blue, hour, m110, satellite, andromenda, visible, left, core, cool, neighboring, long, duration, pick, many, faint, breathtaking, detail, recent, data, indicates, collide, combine, similarly-sized"
Noctilucent Clouds over Paris,"It's northern noctilucent cloud season. Composed of small ice crystals forming only during specific conditions in the upper atmosphere, noctilucent clouds may become visible at sunset during late summer when illuminated by sunlight from below.  Noctilucent clouds are the highest clouds known and now established to be polar mesospheric clouds observed from the ground.  Although observed with NASA's AIM satellite since 2007, much about noctilucent clouds remains unknown and so a topic of active research. The featured image shows expansive and rippled noctilucent clouds wafting over Paris, France. This year, several northern locations are already reporting especially vivid displays of noctilucent clouds.","noctilucent, cloud, paris, northern, season, composed, small, crystal, forming, specific, condition, atmosphere, become, visible, sunset, late, summer, illuminated, sunlight, highest, known, established, polar, mesospheric, observed, ground, nasa, satellite, much, remains, unknown, active, research, featured, image, show, expansive, rippled, wafting, france, year, several, location, reporting, vivid, display"
Webb's First Deep Field,"This is the deepest, sharpest infrared image of the cosmos so far. The view of the early Universe toward the southern constellation Volans was achieved in 12.5 hours of exposure with the NIRCam instrument on the James Webb Space Telescope. Of course the stars with six visible spikes are well within our own Milky Way. Their diffraction pattern is characteristic of Webb's 18 hexagonal mirror segments operating together as a single 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror. The thousands of galaxies flooding the field of view are members of the distant galaxy cluster SMACS0723-73, some 4.6 billion light-years away. Luminous arcs that seem to infest the deep field are even more distant galaxies though. Their images are distorted and magnified by the dark matter dominated mass of the galaxy cluster, an effect known as gravitational lensing. Analyzing light from two separate arcs below the bright spiky star, Webb's NIRISS instrument indicates the arcs are both images of the same background galaxy. And that galaxy's light took about 9.5 billion years to reach the James Webb Space Telescope.","webb, first, deep, field, deepest, sharpest, infrared, image, cosmos, view, early, universe, southern, constellation, volans, achieved, hour, exposure, nircam, instrument, james, space, telescope, course, star, visible, milky, diffraction, pattern, characteristic, hexagonal, mirror, segment, operating, single, meter, diameter, primary, galaxy, flooding, member, distant, cluster, smacs0723-73, light-year, luminous, seem, distorted, magnified, dark, matter, dominated, mass, effect, known, gravitational, lensing, analyzing, light, separate, bright, spiky, niriss, indicates, background, took, year, reach"
Webb's Southern Ring Nebula,"Cataloged as NGC 3132 the Southern Ring Nebula is a planetary nebula, the death shroud of a dying sun-like star some 2,500 light-years from Earth. Composed of gas and dust the stunning cosmic landscape is nearly half a light-year in diameter, explored in unprecedented detail by the James Webb Space Telescope. In this NIRCam image the bright star near center is a companion of the dying star. In mutual orbit, the star whose transformation has ejected the nebula's gas and dust shells over thousands of years is the fainter stellar partner. Evolving to become a white dwarf, the faint star appears along the diffraction spike extending toward the 8 o'clock position.

Lubovna Full Moon,"On July 13 this well-planned telephoto view recorded a Full Moon rising over Lubovna Castle in eastern Slovakia. The photographer was about 3 kilometers from the castle walls and about 357,000 kilometers from this Full Moon near perigee, the closest point in its elliptical orbit. Known to some as supermoons, full moons near perigee are a little brighter and larger in planet Earth's sky when compared to full moons that occur near the average lunar distance of around 384,000 kilometers. Of course any Full Moon near the horizon can show the effects of refraction over a long sight-line through dense clear atmosphere. In this image, atmospheric refraction creates the slight green flash framed by thin clouds near the top, with a ragged red rim along the bottom edge of July's perigee Full Moon.","full, moon, well-planned, telephoto, view, recorded, rising, castle, eastern, slovakia, photographer, kilometer, wall, perigee, closest, point, elliptical, orbit, known, supermoons, little, brighter, larger, planet, earth, compared, occur, average, lunar, distance, course, horizon, show, effect, refraction, sight-line, dense, clear, image, atmospheric, creates, slight, green, flash, framed, thin, cloud, ragged, bottom, edge, july"
Tycho and Clavius at Dawn,"South is up in this dramatic telescopic view of the lunar terminator and the Moon's rugged southern highlands. The lunar landscape was captured on July 7 with the moon at its first quarter phase. The Sun shines at a low angle from the right as dawn comes to the region's young and old craters Tycho and Clavius. About 100 million years young, Tycho is the sharp-walled 85 kilometer diameter crater below and left of center. Its 2 kilometer tall central peak and far crater wall reflect bright sunlight, Its smooth floor lies in dark shadow. Debris ejected during the impact that created Tycho make it the stand out lunar crater when the Moon is near full though. They produce a highly visible radiating system of light streaks or rays that extend across much of the lunar near side. In fact, some of the material collected at the Apollo 17 landing site, about 2,000 kilometers away, likely originated from the Tycho impact.  One of the oldest and largest craters on the Moon's near side, 225 kilometer diameter Clavius is due south (above) of Tycho. Clavius crater's own ray system resulting from its original impact event would have faded long ago. The old crater's worn walls and smooth floor are now overlayed by newer smaller craters from impacts that occurred after Clavius was formed. Reaching above the older crater, tops of the newer crater walls reflect this dawn's early light to create narrow shining arcs within a shadowed Clavius.","tycho, clavius, dawn, south, dramatic, telescopic, view, lunar, terminator, moon, rugged, southern, highland, landscape, captured, first, quarter, phase, shine, right, come, region, young, crater, year, sharp-walled, kilometer, diameter, left, center, tall, central, peak, wall, reflect, bright, sunlight, smooth, floor, dark, shadow, debris, ejected, impact, created, make, stand, full, produce, visible, radiating, system, light, streak, extend, much, side, fact, material, collected, apollo, landing, site, likely, originated, oldest, largest, near, resulting, original, event, faded, worn, overlayed, newer, smaller, occurred, formed, reaching, older, early, create, narrow, shining, shadowed"
Europa and Jupiter from Voyager 1,"What are those spots on Jupiter? Largest and furthest, just right of center, is the Great Red Spot -- a huge storm system that has been raging on Jupiter possibly since Giovanni Cassini's likely notation of it 357 years ago.  It is not yet known why this Great Spot is red. The spot toward the lower left is one of Jupiter's largest moons: Europa. Images from Voyager in 1979 bolster the modern hypothesis that Europa has an underground ocean and is therefore a good place to look for extraterrestrial life. But what about the dark spot on the upper right? That is a shadow of another of Jupiter's large moons: Io. Voyager 1 discovered Io to be so volcanic that no impact craters could be found.  Sixteen frames from Voyager 1's flyby of Jupiter in 1979 were recently reprocessed and merged to create the featured image.  Forty-five years ago this September, Voyager 1 launched from Earth and started one of the greatest explorations of the Solar System ever.

"Stephan's Quintet from Webb, Hubble, and Subaru","OK, but why can't you combine images from Webb and Hubble? You can, and today's featured image shows one impressive result. Although the recently launched James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) has a larger mirror than Hubble, it specializes in infrared light and can't see blue -- only up to about orange.  Conversely, the Hubble Space Telescope (Hubble) has a smaller mirror than Webb and can't see as far into the infrared as Webb, but can image not only blue light but even ultraviolet.  Therefore, Webb and Hubble data can be combined to create images across a wider variety of colors.  The featured image of four galaxies from Stephan's Quintet shows Webb images as red and also includes images taken by Japan's ground-based Subaru telescope in Hawaii.  Because image data for Webb, Hubble, and Subaru are made freely available, anyone around the world can process it themselves, and even create intriguing and scientifically useful multi-observatory montages.

Pleiades over Half Dome,"Stars come in bunches.  The most famous bunch of stars on the sky is the Pleiades, a bright cluster that can be easily seen with the unaided eye.  The Pleiades lies only about 450 light years away, formed about 100 million years ago, and will likely last about another 250 million years. Our Sun was likely born in a star cluster, but now, being about 4.5 billion years old, its stellar birth companions have long since dispersed. The Pleiades star cluster is pictured over Half Dome, a famous rock structure in Yosemite National Park in California, USA. The featured image is a composite of 28 foreground exposures and 174 images of the stellar background, all taken from the same location and by the same camera on the same night in October 2019. After calculating the timing of a future juxtaposition of the Pleiades and Half Dome, the astrophotrographer was unexpectedly rewarded by an electrical blackout, making the background sky unusually dark.","pleiades, half, dome, star, come, famous, bunch, bright, cluster, seen, unaided, light, year, formed, likely, last, born, stellar, birth, companion, dispersed, pictured, rock, structure, yosemite, national, park, california, featured, image, composite, foreground, exposure, background, taken, location, camera, night, october, calculating, timing, future, juxtaposition, rewarded, electrical, blackout, making, dark"
Jupiter and Ring in Infrared from Webb,"Why does Jupiter have rings?  Jupiter's main ring was discovered in 1979 by NASA's passing Voyager 1 spacecraft, but its origin was then a mystery.  Data from NASA's Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003, however, confirmed the hypothesis that this ring was created by meteoroid impacts on small nearby moons.  As a small meteoroid strikes tiny Metis, for example, it will bore into the moon, vaporize, and explode dirt and dust off into a Jovian orbit. The featured image of Jupiter in infrared light by the James Webb Space Telescope shows not only Jupiter and its clouds, but this ring as well. Also visible is Jupiter's Great Red Spot (GRS) -- in comparatively light color on the right, Jupiter's large moon Europa -- in the center of diffraction spikes on the left, and Europa's shadow -- next to the GRS.

Messier 10 and Comet,"Imaged on July 15 2022, comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) had a Messier moment, sharing this wide telescopic field of view with globular star cluster Messier 10. Of course M10 was cataloged by 18th century comet hunter Charles Messier as the 10th object on his list of things that were definitely not comets. While M10 is about 14 thousand light-years distant, this comet PanSTARRS was about 15 light-minutes from our fair planet following its July 14 closest approach. Its greenish coma and dust tail entertaining 21st century comet watchers, C/2017 K2 is expected to remain a fine telescopic comet in northern summer skies. On a maiden voyage from our Solar System's remote Oort Cloud this comet PanSTARRS was discovered in May 2017 when it was beyond the orbit of Saturn. At the time that made it the most distant active inbound comet known.

Spiral Galaxy M74: A Sharper View,"Beautiful spiral galaxy Messier 74 (also known as NGC 628) lies some 32 million light-years away toward the constellation Pisces. An island universe of about 100 billion stars with two prominent spiral arms, M74 has long been admired by astronomers as a perfect example of a grand-design spiral galaxy. M74's central region is brought into a stunning, sharp focus in this recently processed image using publicly available data from the James Webb Space Telescope.

Apollo 11 Landing Panorama,"Have you seen a panorama from another world lately?  Assembled from high-resolution scans of the original film frames, this one sweeps across the magnificent desolation of the Apollo 11 landing site on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility. The images were taken by Neil Armstrong looking out his window of the Eagle Lunar Module shortly after the July 20, 1969 landing. The frame at the far left (AS11-37-5449) is the first picture taken by a person on another world. Toward the south, thruster nozzles can be seen in the foreground on the left, while at the right, the shadow of the Eagle is visible to the west. For scale, the large, shallow crater on the right has a diameter of about 12 meters.

Saturn in Infrared from Cassini,"Many details of Saturn appear clearly in infrared light.  Bands of clouds show great structure, including long stretching storms.  Also quite striking in infrared is the unusual hexagonal cloud pattern surrounding Saturn's North Pole.  Each side of the dark hexagon spans roughly the width of our Earth. The hexagon's existence was not predicted, and its origin and likely stability remains a topic of research.  Saturn's famous rings circle the planet and cast shadows below the equator. The featured image was taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft in 2014 in several infrared colors.

Find the New Moon,"Can you find the Moon? This usually simple task can be quite difficult.  Even though the Moon is above your horizon half of the time, its phase can be anything from crescent to full. The featured image was taken in late May from Sant Martí d'Empúries, Spain, over the Mediterranean Sea in the early morning. One reason you can't find this moon is because it is very near to its new phase, when very little of the half illuminated by the Sun is visible to the Earth. Another reason is because this moon is near the horizon and so seen through a long path of Earth's atmosphere -- a path which dims the already faint crescent. Any crescent moon is only visible near the direction the Sun, and so only locatable near sunrise or sunset. The Moon runs through all of its phases in a month (moon-th), and this month the thinnest sliver of a crescent -- a new moon -- will occur in three days.","find, moon, simple, task, difficult, horizon, half, time, phase, anything, crescent, full, featured, image, taken, sant, martí, d'empúries, spain, mediterranean, early, morning, reason, little, illuminated, visible, earth, seen, path, atmosphere, dims, faint, direction, locatable, sunrise, sunset, month, moon-th, thinnest, sliver, occur"

Up before sunrise on July 8th, the featured photographer was able to capture in dramatic fashion one of the few comets visible to the unaided eye this century, an inner-Solar System intruder that has become known as the Great Comet of 2020.  The resulting video detailed Comet NEOWISE from Italy rising over the Adriatic Sea. The time-lapse video combines over 240 images taken over 30 minutes.  The comet was seen rising through a foreground of bright and undulating noctilucent clouds, and before a background of distant stars.  Comet NEOWISE remained unexpectedly bright until 2020 August, with its ion and dust tails found to emanate from a nucleus spanning about five kilometers across.

Crepuscular Moon Rays over Denmark,"This moon made quite an entrance. Typically, a moonrise is quiet and serene.  Taking a few minutes to fully peek above the horizon, Earth's largest orbital companion can remain relatively obscure until it rises high in the nighttime sky. About a week ago, however, and despite being only half lit by the Sun, this rising moon put on a show -- at least from this location. The reason was that, as seen from Limfjord in Nykøbing Mors, Denmark, the moon rose below scattered clouds near the horizon.  The result, captured here in a single exposure, was that moonlight poured through gaps in the clouds to created what are called crepuscular rays.  These rays can fan out dramatically across the sky when starting near the horizon, and can even appear to converge on the other side of the sky. Well behind our Moon, stars from our Milky Way galaxy dot the background, and our galaxy's largest orbital companion -- the Andromeda galaxy -- can be found on the upper left.

North Celestial Tree,"An ancient tree seems to reach out and touch Earth's North Celestial Pole in this well-planned night skyscape. Consecutive exposures for the timelapse composition were recorded with a camera fixed to a tripod in the Yiwu Desert Poplar Forests in northwest Xinjiang, China. The graceful star trail arcs reflect Earth's daily rotation around its axis. By extension, the axis of rotation leads to the center of the concentric arcs in the night sky. Known as the North Star, bright star Polaris is a friend to northern hemisphere night sky photographers and celestial navigators alike. That's because Polaris lies very close to the North Celestial Pole on the sky. Of course it can be found at the tip of an outstretched barren branch in a postcard from a rotating planet.","north, celestial, tree, ancient, seems, reach, touch, earth, pole, well-planned, night, skyscape, consecutive, exposure, timelapse, composition, recorded, camera, fixed, tripod, yiwu, desert, poplar, forest, northwest, xinjiang, china, graceful, star, trail, reflect, daily, rotation, axis, extension, lead, center, concentric, known, bright, polaris, friend, northern, photographer, navigator, alike, close, course, found, outstretched, barren, branch, rotating, planet"
SOFIA's Southern Lights,"SOFIA, the Stratospheric Observatory for Infrared Astronomy, is a Boeing 747SP aircraft modified to carry a large reflecting telescope into the stratosphere. The ability of the airborne facility to climb above about 99 percent of Earth's infrared-blocking atmosphere has allowed researchers to observe from almost anywhere over the planet. On a science mission flying deep into the southern auroral oval, astronomer Ian Griffin, director of New Zealand’s Otago Museum, captured this view from the observatory's south facing starboard side on July 17. Bright star Canopus shines in the southern night above curtains of aurora australis, or southern lights. The plane was flying far south of New Zealand at the time at roughly 62 degrees southern latitude. Unfortunately, after a landing at Christchurch severe weather damaged SOFIA requiring repairs and the cancellation of the remainder of its final southern hemisphere deployment.","sofia, southern, light, stratospheric, observatory, infrared, boeing, aircraft, modified, carry, large, reflecting, telescope, stratosphere, ability, airborne, facility, climb, percent, earth, infrared-blocking, atmosphere, allowed, researcher, observe, planet, science, mission, flying, deep, auroral, oval, astronomer, griffin, director, zealand, museum, captured, south, facing, starboard, side, july, bright, star, canopus, shine, night, curtain, australis, plane, time, degree, latitude, landing, christchurch, severe, weather, damaged, requiring, repair, cancellation, remainder, final, hemisphere, deployment"
The Eagle Rises,"Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this stereo view from lunar orbit. The 3D anaglyph was created from two photographs (AS11-44-6633, AS11-44-6634) taken by astronaut Michael Collins during the 1969 Apollo 11 mission. It features the lunar module ascent stage, dubbed The Eagle, rising to meet the command module in lunar orbit on July 21. Aboard the ascent stage are Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin, the first to walk on the Moon. The smooth, dark area on the lunar surface is Mare Smythii located just below the equator on the extreme eastern edge of the Moon's near side.  Poised beyond the lunar horizon is our fair planet Earth.","eagle, rise, red/blue, glass, check, stereo, view, lunar, orbit, created, photograph, as11-44-6633, as11-44-6634, taken, astronaut, michael, collins, apollo, mission, feature, module, ascent, stage, dubbed, rising, meet, command, aboard, armstrong, buzz, aldrin, walk, moon, dark, area, surface, mare, smythii, located, equator, extreme, eastern, edge, near, side, poised, horizon, fair, planet, earth"
Starburst Galaxy M94 from Hubble,"Why does this galaxy have a ring of bright blue stars?  Beautiful island universe Messier 94 lies a mere 15 million light-years distant in the northern constellation of the Hunting Dogs (Canes Venatici). A popular target for Earth-based astronomers, the face-on spiral galaxy is about 30,000 light-years across, with spiral arms sweeping through the outskirts of its broad disk. But this Hubble Space Telescope field of view spans about 7,000 light-years across M94's central region. The featured close-up highlights the galaxy's compact, bright nucleus, prominent inner dust lanes, and the remarkable bluish ring of young massive stars. The ring stars are all likely less than 10 million years old, indicating that M94 is a starburst galaxy that is experiencing an epoch of rapid star formation from inspiraling gas. The circular ripple of blue stars is likely a wave propagating outward, having been triggered by the gravity and rotation of a oval matter distributions. Because M94 is relatively nearby, astronomers can better explore details of its starburst ring.","starburst, galaxy, hubble, ring, bright, blue, star, beautiful, island, universe, light-year, distant, northern, constellation, hunting, cane, popular, target, earth-based, astronomer, face-on, spiral, sweeping, outskirt, broad, disk, space, telescope, field, view, span, central, region, featured, close-up, highlight, compact, nucleus, prominent, inner, dust, lane, remarkable, bluish, young, massive, likely, year, indicating, experiencing, epoch, rapid, formation, inspiraling, circular, ripple, wave, propagating, triggered, gravity, rotation, oval, matter, distribution, nearby, detail"
Mountains of Dust in the Carina Nebula,"It's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning. More precisely, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the dusty stellar nurseries in which they formed. Located in the Carina Nebula and known informally as Mystic Mountain, these pillar's appearance is dominated by the dark dust even though it is composed mostly of clear hydrogen gas. Dust pillars such as these are actually much thinner than air and only appear as mountains due to relatively small amounts of opaque interstellar dust.  About 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and highlights an interior region of Carina which spans about three light years. Within a few million years, the stars will likely win out completely and the entire dust mountain will evaporate.","mountain, dust, carina, nebula, star, versus, winning, energetic, light, massive, formed, evaporating, dispersing, dusty, stellar, nursery, located, known, mystic, pillar, appearance, dominated, dark, composed, clear, hydrogen, much, thinner, appear, small, amount, opaque, interstellar, light-year, distant, featured, image, taken, hubble, space, telescope, highlight, interior, region, span, year, likely, entire, evaporate"
A Moon Dressed Like Saturn,"Why does Saturn appear so big? It doesn't -- what is pictured are foreground clouds on Earth crossing in front of the Moon. The Moon shows a slight crescent phase with most of its surface visible by reflected Earthlight known as ashen glow. The Sun directly illuminates the brightly lit lunar crescent from the bottom, which means that the Sun must be below the horizon and so the image was taken before sunrise.  This double take-inducing picture was captured on 2019 December 24, two days before the Moon slid in front of the Sun to create a solar eclipse. In the foreground, lights from small Guatemalan towns are visible behind the huge volcano Pacaya.

Halo of the Cat's Eye,"What created the unusual halo around the Cat's Eye nebula? No one is sure. What is sure is that the Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae on the sky.  Although haunting symmetries are seen in the bright central region, this image was taken to feature its intricately structured outer halo, which spans over three light-years across.  Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a Sun-like star. Only recently however, have some planetaries been found to have expansive halos, likely formed from material shrugged off during earlier puzzling episodes in the star's evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of the Cat's Eye Nebula's halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.","halo, created, unusual, sure, nebula, known, planetary, haunting, symmetry, seen, bright, central, region, image, taken, feature, structured, outer, span, light-year, appreciated, final, phase, life, sun-like, star, planetaries, found, expansive, formed, material, shrugged, puzzling, episode, evolution, thought, last, year, astronomer, estimate, filamentary, portion"
M13: The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules,"In 1716, English astronomer Edmond Halley noted, ""This is but a little Patch, but it shows itself to the naked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent."" Of course, M13 is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, one of the brightest globular star clusters in the northern sky. Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core. Distant background galaxies in the medium-wide field of view include NGC 6207 at the upper left.","great, globular, cluster, hercules, english, astronomer, edmond, halley, noted, little, patch, show, naked, serene, moon, absent, course, recognized, brightest, star, northern, sharp, telescopic, view, reveal, spectacular, hundred, distance, light-year, crowd, region, diameter, approaching, core, upwards, contained, cube, side, comparison, closest, remarkable, range, brightness, recorded, image, follows, dense, distant, background, galaxy, medium-wide, field, include, upper, left"
A Beautiful Trifid,"The beautiful Trifid Nebula is a cosmic study in contrasts. Also known as M20, it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. But the red emission region, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its popular name. Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of the emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region. The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across. Too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers the area of a full moon in planet Earth's sky. Open star cluster M21 just peeks into this telescopic field of view along the bottom right edge of the frame.","beautiful, trifid, nebula, cosmic, study, contrast, known, light-year, rich, constellation, sagittarius, star, forming, region, plane, galaxy, illustrate, different, astronomical, emission, dominated, light, hydrogen, atom, blue, reflection, produced, dust, reflecting, starlight, dark, dense, cloud, appear, silhouette, separated, part, obscuring, lane, lends, popular, name, pillar, sculpted, newborn, right, center, famous, hubble, space, telescope, close-up, image, faint, seen, unaided, cover, area, full, moon, planet, earth, open, cluster, peek, telescopic, field, view, bottom, edge, frame"
Stereo Phobos,"Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Phobos, grooved moon of Mars! Captured in 2004 by the High Resolution Stereo Camera on board ESA's Mars Express spacecraft, the image data was recorded at a distance of about 200 kilometers from the martian moon. This tantalizing stereo anaglyph view shows the Mars-facing side of Phobos. It highlights the asteroid-like moon's cratered and grooved surface. Up to hundreds of meters wide, the mysterious grooves may be related to the impact that created Stickney crater, the large crater at the left.

Meteor before Galaxy,"What's that green streak in front of the Andromeda galaxy? A meteor. While photographing the Andromeda galaxy in 2016, near the peak of the Perseid Meteor Shower, a small pebble from deep space crossed right in front of our Milky Way Galaxy's far-distant companion. The small meteor took only a fraction of a second to pass through this 10-degree field.  The meteor flared several times while braking violently upon entering Earth's atmosphere.  The green color was created, at least in part, by the meteor's gas glowing as it vaporized. Although the exposure was timed to catch a Perseid meteor, the orientation of the imaged streak seems a better match to a meteor from the Southern Delta Aquariids, a meteor shower that peaked a few weeks earlier.  Not coincidentally, the Perseid Meteor Shower peaks later this week, although this year the meteors will have to outshine a sky brightened by a nearly full moon.","meteor, galaxy, green, streak, front, andromeda, photographing, peak, perseid, shower, small, pebble, deep, space, crossed, right, milky, far-distant, companion, took, fraction, second, 10-degree, field, flared, several, time, braking, entering, earth, atmosphere, color, created, least, part, glowing, vaporized, exposure, timed, catch, orientation, imaged, seems, match, southern, delta, aquariids, peaked, week, year, outshine, brightened, full, moon"
The Lagoon Nebula without Stars,"Ridges of glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds inhabit the turbulent, cosmic depths of the Lagoon Nebula. Also known as M8, the bright star forming region is about 5,000 light-years distant. But it still makes for a popular stop on telescopic tours of the constellation Sagittarius, toward the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Dominated by the telltale red emission of ionized hydrogen atoms recombining with stripped electrons, this stunning, deep view of the Lagoon is nearly 100 light-years across.  Right of center, the bright, compact, hourglass shape is gas ionized and sculpted by energetic radiation and extreme stellar winds from a massive young star. In fact, although digitally removed from the featured image, the many bright stars of open cluster NGC 6530 drift within the nebula, just formed in the Lagoon several million years ago.","lagoon, nebula, star, ridge, glowing, interstellar, dark, dust, cloud, inhabit, turbulent, cosmic, depth, known, bright, forming, region, light-year, distant, make, popular, stop, telescopic, tour, constellation, sagittarius, center, milky, galaxy, dominated, telltale, emission, ionized, hydrogen, atom, recombining, stripped, electron, stunning, deep, view, right, compact, hourglass, shape, sculpted, energetic, radiation, extreme, stellar, wind, massive, young, fact, removed, featured, image, many, open, cluster, drift, formed, several, year"
Leaving Earth,"What it would look like to leave planet Earth? Such an event was recorded visually in great detail by the MESSENGER spacecraft as it swung back past the Earth in 2005 on its way in toward the planet Mercury. Earth can be seen rotating in this time-lapse video, as it recedes into the distance. The sunlit half of Earth is so bright that background stars are not visible. The robotic MESSENGER spacecraft orbit around Mercury from 2011 to 2015 has conducted the first complete map of the surface. On occasion, MESSENGER has continued to peer back at its home world. MESSENGER is one of the few things created on the Earth that will never return.  At the end of its mission MESSENGER crashed into Mercury's surface.","leaving, earth, look, leave, planet, event, recorded, great, detail, messenger, spacecraft, swung, mercury, seen, rotating, time-lapse, video, recedes, distance, sunlit, half, bright, background, star, visible, robotic, orbit, conducted, first, complete, surface, occasion, continued, peer, home, world, thing, created, return, mission, crashed"
Dust Clouds of the Pacman Nebula,"Stars can create huge and intricate dust sculptures from the dense and dark molecular clouds from which they are born.  The tools the stars use to carve their detailed works are high energy light and fast stellar winds.  The heat they generate evaporates the dark molecular dust as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red.   Pictured here, a new open cluster of stars designated IC 1590 is nearing completion around the intricate interstellar dust structures in the emission nebula  NGC 281, dubbed the Pac-man Nebula because of its overall shape.  The dust cloud on the upper left is classified as a  Bok Globule as it may gravitationally collapse and form a star -- or stars.

Perseids and MAGIC,"On August 11, 2021 a multi-mirror, 17 meter-diameter MAGIC telescope reflected this starry night sky from the Roque de los Muchachos European Northern Observatory on the Canary Island of La Palma. MAGIC stands for Major Atmospheric Gamma Imaging Cherenkov. The telescopes can see the brief flashes of optical light produced in particle air showers as high-energy gamma rays impact the Earth's upper atmosphere. To the dark-adapted eye the mirror segments offer a tantalizing reflection of stars and nebulae along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy. But directly behind the segmented mirror telescope, low on the horizon, lies the constellation Perseus. And on that date the dramatic composite nightscape also captured meteors streaming from the radiant of the annual Perseid meteor shower. This year the Perseid shower activity will again peak around August 13 but perseid meteors will have to compete with the bright light of a Full Moon.","perseids, magic, multi-mirror, meter-diameter, telescope, reflected, starry, night, roque, muchachos, european, northern, observatory, canary, island, stand, major, atmospheric, gamma, imaging, cherenkov, brief, flash, optical, light, produced, shower, high-energy, impact, earth, upper, dark-adapted, mirror, segment, offer, tantalizing, reflection, star, nebula, plane, milky, galaxy, segmented, horizon, constellation, perseus, date, dramatic, composite, nightscape, captured, meteor, streaming, radiant, annual, perseid, year, activity, peak, compete, bright, full, moon"
Portrait of the Eagle Nebula,"A star cluster around 2 million years young surrounded by natal clouds of dust and glowing gas, Messier 16 (M16) is also known as The Eagle Nebula. This beautifully detailed image of the region adopts the colorful Hubble palette and includes cosmic sculptures made famous in Hubble Space Telescope close-ups of the starforming complex. Described as elephant trunks or Pillars of Creation, dense, dusty columns rising near the center are light-years in length but are gravitationally contracting to form stars. Energetic radiation from the cluster stars erodes material near the tips, eventually exposing the embedded new stars. Extending from the ridge of bright emission left of center is another dusty starforming column known as the Fairy of Eagle Nebula. M16 lies about 7,000 light-years away, an easy target for binoculars or small telescopes in a nebula rich part of the sky toward the split constellation Serpens Cauda (the tail of the snake). As framed, this telescopic portrait of the Eagle Nebula is about 70 light-years across.","portrait, eagle, nebula, star, cluster, year, young, surrounded, natal, cloud, dust, glowing, messier, known, detailed, image, region, adopts, colorful, hubble, palette, includes, cosmic, sculpture, made, famous, space, telescope, close-ups, starforming, complex, described, elephant, trunk, pillar, creation, dense, dusty, column, rising, center, light-year, length, contracting, form, energetic, radiation, erodes, material, exposing, embedded, extending, ridge, bright, emission, left, fairy, easy, target, binoculars, small, rich, part, split, constellation, serpens, cauda, tail, snake, framed, telescopic"
Herschel Crater on Mimas,"Mimas, small 400 kilometer-diameter moon of Saturn, is host to 130 kilometer-diameter Herschel crater, one of the larger impact craters in the entire Solar System. The robotic Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn in 2010 recorded this startling view of small moon and big crater while making a 10,000-kilometer record close pass by the diminutive icy world. Shown in contrast-enhanced false color, the image data reveal more clearly that Herschel's landscape is colored slightly differently from heavily cratered terrain nearby.  The color difference could yield surface composition clues to the violent history of Mimas. Of course, an impact on Mimas any larger than the one that created the 130-kilometer Herschel might have destroyed the small moon of Saturn.","herschel, crater, mimas, small, kilometer-diameter, moon, saturn, host, larger, impact, entire, solar, system, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, orbiting, recorded, startling, view, making, 10,000-kilometer, record, close, diminutive, world, shown, contrast-enhanced, false, color, image, data, reveal, landscape, colored, cratered, terrain, nearby, difference, yield, surface, composition, clue, violent, history, course, created, destroyed"
4000 Exoplanets,"Over 4000 planets are now known to exist outside our Solar System. Known as exoplanets, this milestone was passed last month, as recorded by NASA's Exoplanet Archive. The featured video highlights these exoplanets in sound and light, starting chronologically from the first confirmed detection in 1992 and continuing into 2019.  The entire night sky is first shown compressed with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy making a giant U.  Exoplanets detected by slight jiggles in their parents-star's colors (radial velocity) appear in pink, while those detected by slight dips in their parent star's brightness (transit) are shown in purple. Further, those exoplanets imaged directly appear in orange, while those detected by gravitationally magnifying the light of a background star (microlensing) are shown in green.  The faster a planet orbits its parent star, the higher the accompanying tone played. The retired Kepler satellite has discovered about half of these first 4000 exoplanets in just one region of the sky, while the TESS mission is on track to find even more, all over the sky, orbiting the brightest nearby stars.  Finding exoplanets not only helps humanity to better understand the potential prevalence of life elsewhere in the universe, but also how our Earth and Solar System were formed.","exoplanets, planet, known, exist, solar, system, passed, last, month, recorded, nasa, exoplanet, archive, featured, video, highlight, sound, light, starting, confirmed, detection, continuing, entire, night, shown, compressed, central, band, milky, galaxy, making, giant, detected, slight, jiggle, parents-star, color, radial, velocity, appear, pink, parent, star, brightness, transit, purple, imaged, orange, magnifying, background, microlensing, green, orbit, higher, accompanying, tone, played, retired, kepler, satellite, discovered, half, first, region, tess, mission, track, find, orbiting, brightest, nearby, finding, help, humanity, understand, potential, prevalence, life, universe, earth, formed"
The Cygnus Wall of Star Formation,"The North America nebula on the sky can do what the North America continent on Earth cannot -- form stars.  Specifically, in analogy to the Earth-confined continent, the bright part that appears as Central America and Mexico is actually a hot bed of gas, dust, and newly formed stars known as the Cygnus Wall.  The featured image shows the star forming wall lit and eroded by bright young stars, and partly hidden by the dark dust they have created.  The part of the North America nebula (NGC 7000) shown spans about 15 light years and lies about 1,500 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).","cygnus, wall, star, formation, north, america, nebula, continent, earth, form, analogy, earth-confined, bright, part, appears, central, mexico, dust, formed, known, featured, image, show, forming, eroded, young, hidden, dark, created, shown, span, light, year, constellation, swan"
A Meteor Wind over Tunisia,"Does the Earth ever pass through a wind of meteors? Yes, and they are frequently visible as meteor showers. Almost all meteors are sand-sized debris that escaped from a Sun-orbiting comet or asteroid, debris that continues in an elongated orbit around the Sun. Circling the same Sun, our Earth can move through an orbiting debris stream, where it can appear, over time, as a meteor wind. The meteors that light up in Earth's atmosphere, however, are usually destroyed. Their streaks, though, can all be traced back to a single point on the sky called the radiant.  The featured image composite was taken over two days in late July near the ancient Berber village Zriba El Alia in Tunisia, during the peak of the Southern Delta Aquariids meteor shower. The radiant is to the right of the image. A few days ago our Earth experienced the peak of a more famous meteor wind -- the Perseids.","meteor, wind, tunisia, earth, visible, shower, sand-sized, debris, escaped, sun-orbiting, comet, asteroid, continues, elongated, orbit, circling, move, orbiting, stream, appear, time, light, atmosphere, destroyed, streak, traced, single, point, called, radiant, featured, image, composite, taken, late, july, ancient, berber, village, zriba, alia, peak, southern, delta, aquariids, right, experienced, famous, perseids"
Stargate Milky Way,"There is a huge gate of stars in the sky, and you pass through it twice a day. The stargate is actually our Milky Way Galaxy, and it is the spin of the Earth that appears to propel you through it. More typically, the central band of our Milky Way appears as a faint band stretching across the sky, only visible in away from bright city lights. In a long-exposure wide-angle image from a dark location like this, though, the Milky Way's central plane is easily visible. The featured picture is a digital composite involving multiple exposures taken on the same night and with the same camera, but employing a stereographic projection that causes the Milky Way to appear as a giant circular portal. Inside the stargate-like arc of our Galaxy is a faint stripe called zodiacal light -- sunlight reflected by dust in our Solar System. In the foreground are cacti and dry rocks found in the rough terrain of the high desert of Chile, not far from the El Sauce Observatory and the developing Vera Rubin Observatory, the latter expected to begin routine operations in 2024.","stargate, milky, huge, gate, star, galaxy, spin, earth, appears, propel, central, band, faint, stretching, visible, bright, city, light, long-exposure, wide-angle, image, dark, location, plane, featured, picture, digital, composite, involving, multiple, exposure, taken, night, camera, employing, stereographic, projection, cause, appear, giant, circular, portal, stargate-like, stripe, called, zodiacal, sunlight, reflected, dust, solar, system, foreground, cactus, rock, found, terrain, high, desert, chile, sauce, observatory, developing, vera, rubin, latter, expected, begin, routine, operation"
Full Moon Perseids,"The annual Perseid meteor shower was near its peak on August 13. As planet Earth crossed through streams of debris left by periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle meteors rained in northern summer night skies. But even that night's nearly Full Moon shining near the top of this composited view couldn't hide all of the popular shower's meteor streaks. The image captures some of the brightest perseid meteors in many short exposures recorded over more than two hours before the dawn. It places the shower's radiant in the heroic constellation of Perseus just behind a well-lit medieval tower in the village of Sant Llorenc de la Muga, Girona, Spain. Observed in medieval times, the Perseid meteor shower is also known in Catholic tradition as the Tears of St. Lawrence, and festivities are celebrated close to the annual peak of the meteor shower.

Saturn: 1993 - 2022,"Saturn is the most distant planet of the Solar System easily visible to the unaided eye. With this extraordinary, long-term astro-imaging project begun in 1993, you can follow the ringed gas giant for one Saturn year as it wanders once around the ecliptic plane, finishing a single orbit around the Sun by 2022. Constructed from individual images made over 29 Earth years, the split panorama is centered along the ecliptic and crossed by the plane of our Milky Way galaxy. Saturn's position in 1993 is at the right side, upper panel in the constellation Capricornus and progresses toward the left. It returns to the spot in Capricornus at left in the lower panel in 2022.

Stardust and Comet Tails,"Heading for its closest approach to the Sun, or perihelion, on December 19 comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) remains a sight for telescopic observers as it sweeps through planet Earth's skies in the constellation Scorpius. The comet currently sports a greenish coma, long whitish dust tail, and short ion tail in this deep image from August 18. The 2x3 degree wide field of view includes part of the dusty nebula IC 4592 reflecting blue starlight. Also known as the Blue Horsehead Nebula, IC 4592 is about 400 light-years distant while the comet is just under 17 light-minutes away. First spotted at a distance well beyond the orbit of Saturn C/2017 K2 is on its maiden voyage to the inner solar system, a pristine visitor from the remote Oort cloud.","stardust, comet, tail, heading, closest, approach, perihelion, december, c/2017, panstarrs, remains, sight, telescopic, sweep, planet, earth, constellation, scorpius, sport, greenish, coma, whitish, dust, short, deep, image, august, degree, wide, field, view, includes, part, dusty, nebula, reflecting, blue, starlight, known, horsehead, light-year, distant, light-minutes, spotted, distance, orbit, saturn, maiden, voyage, inner, solar, system, pristine, visitor, remote, oort, cloud"
The Spinning Pulsar of the Crab Nebula,"At the core of the Crab Nebula lies a city-sized, magnetized neutron star spinning 30 times a second. Known as the Crab Pulsar, it is the bright spot in the center of the gaseous swirl at the nebula's core. About twelve light-years across, the spectacular picture frames the glowing gas, cavities and swirling filaments near the Crab Nebula's center.  The featured picture combines visible light from the Hubble Space Telescope in purple, X-ray light from the Chandra X-ray Observatory in blue, and infrared light from the Spitzer Space Telescope in red.  Like a cosmic dynamo the Crab pulsar powers the emission from the nebula, driving a shock wave through surrounding material and accelerating the spiraling electrons. With more mass than the Sun and the density of an atomic nucleus,the spinning pulsar is the collapsed core of a massive star that exploded. The outer parts of the Crab Nebula are the expanding remnants of the star's component gasses. The supernova explosion was witnessed on planet Earth in the year 1054.

Earth's Recent Climate Spiral,"Is our Earth warming? Compared to the past 250 million years, the Earth is currently enduring a relative cold spell, possibly about four degrees Celsius below average.  Over the past 120 years, though, data indicate that the average global temperature of the Earth has increased by nearly one degree Celsius.  The featured visualization video depicts Earth's recent global warming in graphic terms. The depicted temperatures are taken from the Goddard Institute for Space Studies' Surface Temperature Analysis. Already noticeable by many, Earth's recent warming trend is causing sea levels to rise, precipitation patterns to change, and pole ice to melt.  Few now disagree that recent global warming is occurring, and the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) has concluded that we humans have created a warming surge that is likely to continue.  A continuation could impact many local agricultures and even the global economy.  Although there seems to be no simple solutions, geoengineering projects that might help include artificial cloud creation to reduce the amount of sunlight heating the Earth's surface.","earth, recent, climate, spiral, warming, compared, year, enduring, relative, cold, spell, degree, celsius, average, data, indicate, global, temperature, increased, featured, visualization, video, depicts, graphic, term, depicted, taken, institute, space, study, surface, analysis, noticeable, many, trend, causing, level, rise, precipitation, pattern, change, pole, melt, disagree, occurring, intergovernmental, panel, ipcc, concluded, human, created, surge, likely, continue, continuation, impact, local, agriculture, economy, seems, simple, solution, geoengineering, project, help, include, artificial, cloud, creation, reduce, amount, sunlight, heating"
Meteor & Milky Way over the Mediterranean,"Careful planning made this a nightscape to remember. First, the night itself was chosen to occur during the beginning of this year's Perseid Meteor Shower.  Next, the time of night was chosen to be before the bright Moon would rise and dominate the night sky's brightness. The picturesque foreground was selected to be a rocky beach of the Mediterranean Sea in Le Dramont, France, with, at the time, île d’Or island situated near the ominously descending central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Once everything was set and with the weather cooperating, all of the frames for this seemingly surreal nightscape were acquired within 15 minutes. What you can't see is that, on this night, the astrophotographer brought along his father who, although unskilled in modern sky-capture techniques, once made it a point to teach his child about the sky.

The Cartwheel Galaxy from Webb,"To some, it looks like a wheel of a cart. In fact, because of its outward appearance, the presence of a central galaxy, and its connection with what looks like the spokes of a wheel, the galaxy on the right is known as the Cartwheel Galaxy. To others, however, it looks like a complicated interaction between galaxies awaiting explanation. Along with the two galaxies on the left, the Cartwheel is part of a group of galaxies about 500 million light years away in the constellation Sculptor.  The large galaxy's rim spans over 100,000 light years and is composed of star forming regions filled with extremely bright and massive stars.  The Cartwheel's ring-like shape is the result of gravitational disruption caused by a smaller galaxy passing through a large one, compressing the interstellar gas and dust and causing a star formation wave to move out like a ripple across the surface of a pond. The featured recent image of the Cartwheel Galaxy by the Webb Space Telescope reveals new details not only about where stars are forming, but also about activity near the galaxy's central black hole.

Tiangong Space Station Transits the Moon,"The rugged lunar south polar region lies at the top of this colorful portrait of a last quarter Moon made on August 20. Constructed from video frames and still images taken at Springrange, New South Wales, Australia it also captures a transit of China's Tiangong Space Station. The transit itself was fleeting, taking the space station less than a second to cross the shadowed and sunlit lunar disk. The low Earth orbiting Tiangong is at an altitude of about 400 kilometers, while the Moon is some 400,000 kilometers away. Subtle color differences along the bright lunar surface are revealed in the multiple stacked frames.

IC 5146: The Cocoon Nebula,"Inside the Cocoon Nebula is a newly developing cluster of stars. Cataloged as IC 5146, the beautiful nebula is nearly 15 light-years wide. Soaring high in northern summer night skies, it's located some 4,000 light years away toward the constellation Cygnus the Swan. Like other star forming regions, it stands out in red, glowing, hydrogen gas excited by young, hot stars, and dust-reflected starlight at the edge of an otherwise invisible molecular cloud.  In fact, the bright star found near the center of this nebula is likely only a few hundred thousand years old, powering the nebular glow as it clears out a cavity in the molecular cloud's star forming dust and gas. A 29 hour long integration with a small telescope from Ayr, Ontario, Canada resulted in this exceptionally deep color view tracing tantalizing features within and surrounding the dusty stellar nursery.","cocoon, nebula, developing, cluster, star, cataloged, beautiful, light-year, wide, soaring, high, northern, summer, night, located, light, year, constellation, cygnus, swan, forming, region, stand, glowing, hydrogen, excited, young, dust-reflected, starlight, edge, invisible, molecular, cloud, fact, bright, found, center, powering, nebular, glow, clear, cavity, dust, hour, long, integration, small, telescope, canada, resulted, deep, color, view, tracing, tantalizing, feature, surrounding, dusty, stellar, nursery"
Perijove 11: Passing Jupiter,"Here comes Jupiter! NASA's robotic spacecraft Juno is continuing on its highly-elongated orbits around our Solar System's largest planet.  The featured video is from perijove 11 in early 2018, the eleventh time Juno has passed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016.  This time-lapse, color-enhanced movie covers about four hours and morphs between 36 JunoCam images. The video begins with Jupiter rising as Juno approaches from the north. As Juno reaches its closest view -- from about 3,500 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail. Juno passes light zones and dark belt of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than hurricanes on Earth.  After the perijove, Jupiter recedes into the distance, then displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter's south.  To get desired science data, Juno swoops so close to Jupiter that its instruments are exposed to very high levels of radiation.

High-resolution infrared images of Jupiter from the new James Webb Space Telescope (Webb) reveal, for example, previously unknown differences between high-floating bright clouds -- including the Great Red Spot -- and low-lying dark clouds. Also clearly visible in the featured Webb image are Jupiter's dust ring, bright auroras at the poles, and Jupiter's moons Amalthea and Adrastea. Large volcanic moon Io's magnetic funneling of charged particles onto Jupiter is also visible in the southern aurora. Some objects are so bright that light noticeably diffracts around Webb's optics creating streaks.

Siccar Point on Mars,"What created this unusual hill on Mars? No one is sure.  A good outlook to survey the surrounding area, Siccar Point stands out from its surroundings in Gale Crater. The unusual mound was visited by the robotic Curiosity rover exploring Mars late last year. Siccar Point not only has a distinctive shape, it has dark rocks above lighter rocks.  The apparent much younger age of the dark rocks indicates a time-break in the usual geological ordering of rock layers -- by a process yet unknown. The Martian hill is named for Siccar Point on Earth, a place in Scotland itself distinctive as a junction between two different rock layers.  Curiosity continues to explore Gale crater on Mars, looking for clues of ancient life.

The Tulip and Cygnus X-1,"Framing a bright emission region, this telescopic view looks out along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the nebula rich constellation Cygnus the Swan. Popularly called the Tulip Nebula, the reddish glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust is also found in the 1959 catalog by astronomer Stewart Sharpless as Sh2-101. Nearly 70 light-years across, the complex and beautiful Tulip Nebula blossoms about 8,000 light-years away. Ultraviolet radiation from young energetic stars at the edge of the Cygnus OB3 association, including O star HDE 227018, ionizes the atoms and powers the emission from the Tulip Nebula. Also in the field of view is microquasar Cygnus X-1, one of the strongest X-ray sources in planet Earth's sky.

M51: The Whirlpool Galaxy,"Find the Big Dipper and follow the handle away from the dipper's bowl until you get to the last bright star. Then, just slide your telescope a little south and west and you'll come upon this stunning pair of interacting galaxies, the 51st entry in Charles Messier's famous catalog. Perhaps the original spiral nebula, the large galaxy with well defined spiral structure is also cataloged as NGC 5194. Its spiral arms and dust lanes clearly sweep in front of its companion galaxy (left), NGC 5195. The pair are about 31 million light-years distant and officially lie within the angular boundaries of the small constellation Canes Venatici. In direct telescopic views, M51 looks faint and fuzzy to the eye. But this remarkably deep image shows off details of the interacting galaxy's striking colors and galactic tidal debris.

Sun and Moon and ISS,"On August 25 Sun and Moon could both be seen in planet Earth's daytime skies. And so could the International Space Station. The ISS crossed the disk of the waning crescent Moon as seen from Shunyi district, Beijing, China at about 11:02 am local time. Some 40 kilometers to the southwest, in Fengtai district, the ISS was seen to cross the Sun's disk too. The solar transit was observed only 29 seconds later. Both transits are compared in these panels, composed of processed and stacked video frames from the two locations.

Sea and Sky Glows over the Oregon Coast,"very step caused the sand to light up blue. That glow was bioluminescence -- a blue radiance that also lights the surf in this surreal scene captured in mid-2018 at Meyer's Creek Beach in Oregon, USA. Volcanic stacks dot the foreground sea, while a thin fog layer scatters light on the horizon. The rays of light spreading from the left horizon were created by car headlights on the Oregon Coast Highway (US 101), while the orange light on the right horizon emanates from a fishing boat.

Several of these stars are visible toward the top of this highly detailed image taken recently by the James Webb Space Telescope, the largest astronomical telescope ever launched. Webb's large mirror and ability to see dust-piercing infrared light has enabled it to capture fascinating details in the dust, hundreds of previously hidden stars, and even some galaxies far in the distance.  The featured jagged cliffs occur in part of Carina known as the Gabriela Mistral Nebula -- because when viewed in another orientation, they appear similar to the facial profile of the famous Chilean poet.

Tarantula Stars R136 from Webb,"Near the center of a nearby star-forming region lies a massive cluster containing some of the largest and hottest stars known.  Collectively known as star cluster NGC 2070, these stars are part of the vast Tarantula Nebula and were captured in two kinds of infrared light by the new Webb Space Telescope.  The main image shows the group of stars at NGC 2070's center -- known as R136 -- in near-infrared, light just a bit too red for humans to see. In contrast, the rollover image captures the cluster center in mid-infrared light, light closer to radio waves.  Since R136's brightest stars emit more of their light in the near infrared, they are much more prominent on that image. This LMC cluster's massive stars emit particle winds and energetic light that are evaporating the gas cloud from which they formed. The Webb images, released yesterday, shows details of R136 and its surroundings that have never been seen before, details that are helping humanity to a better understanding of how all stars are born, evolve and die.","tarantula, star, r136, webb, center, star-forming, region, massive, cluster, containing, largest, hottest, known, part, vast, captured, kind, infrared, light, space, telescope, main, image, show, group, near-infrared, human, contrast, rollover, capture, mid-infrared, radio, wave, brightest, emit, much, prominent, particle, energetic, evaporating, cloud, formed, released, yesterday, detail, surroundings, seen, helping, humanity, understanding, born, evolve"
North America and the Pelican,"Fans of our fair planet might recognize the outlines of these cosmic clouds.

To the right, just off the North America Nebula's east coast, is IC 5070, whose avian profile suggests the Pelican Nebula.  The two bright nebulae are about 1,500 light-years away, part of the same large and complex star forming region, almost as nearby as the better-known Orion Nebula. At that distance, the 3 degree wide field of view would span 80 light-years. This careful cosmic portrait uses narrowband images combined to highlight the bright ionization fronts and the characteristic glow from atomic hydrogen, and oxygen gas.

Interstellar Voyager,"Voyager 1 and Voyager 2 were launched in 1977 on a grand tour of the outer planets of the Solar System. They have become the longest operating and most distant spacecraft from Earth. Both have traveled beyond the heliosphere, the realm defined by the influence of the solar wind and the Sun's magnetic field. On the 45th year of their journey toward the stars Voyager 1 and 2 reached nearly 22 light-hours and 18 light-hours from the Sun respectively and remain the only spacecraft currently exploring interstellar space. Each spacecraft carries a 12-inch gold-plated copper disk with recordings of sounds, pictures and messages.

Red Sprite Lightning over the Czech Republic,"What are those red filaments in the sky? They are a rarely seen form of lightning confirmed only about 35 years ago: red sprites. Research has shown that following a powerful positive cloud-to-ground lightning strike, red sprites may start as 100-meter balls of ionized air that shoot down from about 80-km high at 10 percent the speed of light. They are quickly followed by a group of upward streaking ionized balls. The featured image was taken late last month from the Jeseniky Mountains in northern Moravia in the Czech Republic. The distance to the red sprites is about 200 kilometers. Red sprites take only a fraction of a second to occur and are best seen when powerful thunderstorms are visible from the side.

A Long Snaking Filament on the Sun,"rlier this month, the Sun exhibited one of the longer filaments on record.  Visible as the bright curving streak around the image center, the snaking filament's full extent was estimated to be over half of the Sun's radius -- more than 350,000 kilometers long. A filament is composed of  hot gas held aloft by the Sun's magnetic field, so that viewed from the side it would appear as a raised prominence.  A different, smaller prominence is simultaneously visible at the Sun's edge. The featured image is in false-color and color-inverted to highlight not only the filament but the Sun's carpet chromosphere.  The bright dot on the upper right is actually a dark sunspot about the size of the Earth.  Solar filaments typically last from hours to days, eventually collapsing to return hot plasma back to the Sun. Sometimes, though, they explode and expel particles into the Solar System, some of which trigger auroras on Earth. The pictured filament appeared in early September and continued to hold steady for about a week.","snaking, filament, rlier, month, exhibited, longer, record, visible, bright, curving, streak, image, center, full, extent, estimated, radius, kilometer, composed, held, aloft, magnetic, field, viewed, appear, raised, prominence, different, smaller, edge, featured, false-color, color-inverted, highlight, carpet, upper, dark, sunspot, size, earth, solar, last, hour, collapsing, return, plasma, explode, expel, particle, system, trigger, aurora, pictured, appeared, early, september, continued, hold, steady, week"
Waves of the Great Lacerta Nebula,"It is one of the largest nebulas on the sky -- why isn't it better known? Roughly the same angular size as the Andromeda Galaxy, the Great Lacerta Nebula can be found toward the constellation of the Lizard (Lacerta). The emission nebula is difficult to see with wide-field binoculars because it is so faint, but also usually difficult to see with a large telescope because it is so great in angle -- spanning about three degrees. The depth, breadth, waves, and beauty of the nebula -- cataloged as Sharpless 126 (Sh2-126) -- can best be seen and appreciated with a long duration camera exposure. The featured image is one such combined exposure -- in this case 10 hours over five different colors and over six nights during this past June and July at the IC Astronomy Observatory in Spain. The hydrogen gas in the Great Lacerta Nebula glows red because it is excited by light from the bright star 10 Lacertae, one of the bright blue stars just above the red-glowing nebula's center.  The stars and nebula are about 1,200 light years distant.

Harvest Moon over Sicily,"For northern hemisphere dwellers, September's Full Moon was the Harvest Moon. Reflecting warm hues at sunset it rises over the historic town of Castiglione di Sicilia in this telephoto view from September 9. Famed in festival, story, and song Harvest Moon is just the traditional name of the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox. According to lore the name is a fitting one. Despite the diminishing daylight hours as the growing season drew to a close, farmers could harvest crops by the light of a full moon shining on from dusk to dawn.

The Tarantula Zone,"The Tarantula Nebula, also known as 30 Doradus, is more than a thousand light-years in diameter, a giant star forming region within nearby satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. About 180 thousand light-years away, it's the largest, most violent star forming region known in the whole Local Group of galaxies. The cosmic arachnid sprawls across this magnificent view, an assembly of image data from large space- and ground-based telescopes. Within the Tarantula (NGC 2070), intense radiation, stellar winds, and supernova shocks from the central young cluster of massive stars cataloged as R136 energize the nebular glow and shape the spidery filaments. Around the Tarantula are other star forming regions with young star clusters, filaments, and blown-out bubble-shaped clouds. In fact, the frame includes the site of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A, at lower right. The rich field of view spans about 2 degrees or 4 full moons, in the southern constellation Dorado. But were the Tarantula Nebula closer, say 1,500 light-years distant like the Milky Way's own star forming Orion Nebula, it would take up half the sky.","tarantula, nebula, known, doradus, light-year, diameter, giant, star, forming, region, nearby, satellite, galaxy, large, magellanic, cloud, largest, violent, whole, local, group, cosmic, arachnid, sprawl, magnificent, view, image, data, space-, ground-based, telescope, intense, radiation, stellar, wind, supernova, shock, central, young, cluster, massive, cataloged, r136, energize, nebular, glow, shape, spidery, filament, blown-out, bubble-shaped, fact, frame, includes, site, closest, modern, time, lower, right, rich, field, span, degree, full, moon, southern, constellation, dorado, closer, distant, milky, orion, take, half"
Perseverance in Jezero Crater's Delta,"The Perseverance rover's Mastcam-Z captured images to create this mosaic on August 4, 2022. The car-sized robot was continuing its exploration of the fan-shaped delta of a river that, billions of years ago, flowed into Jezero Crater on Mars. Sedimentary rocks preserved in Jezero's delta are considered one of the best places on Mars to search for potential signs of ancient microbial life and sites recently sampled by the rover, dubbed Wildcat Ridge and Skinner Ridge, are at lower left and upper right in the frame. The samples taken from these areas were sealed inside ultra-clean sample tubes, ultimately intended for return to Earth by future missions. Starting with the Pathfinder Mission and Mars Global Surveyor in 1997, the last 25 years of a continuous robotic exploration of the Red Planet has included orbiters, landers, rovers, and a helicopter from planet Earth.","perseverance, jezero, crater, delta, rover, mastcam-z, captured, image, create, mosaic, august, car-sized, robot, continuing, exploration, fan-shaped, river, year, flowed, sedimentary, rock, preserved, considered, best, place, search, potential, sign, ancient, microbial, life, site, sampled, dubbed, ridge, skinner, left, upper, right, frame, sample, taken, area, sealed, ultra-clean, tube, intended, return, earth, future, mission, starting, pathfinder, global, surveyor, last, continuous, robotic, planet, included, orbiter, lander, helicopter"
Analemma over the Callanish Stones,"If you went outside at the same time every day and took a picture that included the Sun, how would the Sun's position change?  A more visual answer to that question is an analemma, a composite image taken from the same spot at the same time over the course of a year.  The featured analemma was composed from images taken every few days at noon near the village of Callanish in the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, UK.  In the foreground are the Callanish Stones, a stone circle built around 2700 BC during humanity's Bronze Age.  It is not known if the placement of the Callanish Stones has or had astronomical significance.  The ultimate causes for the figure-8 shape of this and all analemmas are the tilt of the Earth axis and the ellipticity of the Earth's orbit around the Sun.  At the solstices, the Sun will appear at the top or bottom of an analemma. The featured image was taken near the December solstice and so the Sun appears near the bottom.  Equinoxes, however, correspond to analemma middle points -- not the intersection point. This coming Friday at 1:04 am (UT) -- Thursday in the Americas -- is the equinox (""equal night""), when day and night are equal over all of planet Earth. Many cultures celebrate a change of season at an equinox.

Star Trails and Lightning over the Pyrenees,"The beauty in this image comes in layers. On the bottom layer is the picturesque village of Manlleu in Barcelona, Spain.  The six-minute exposure makes car lights into streaks. The next layer is a mountain -- Serra de Bellmunt -- of Europe's famous Pyrenees. Next up is a tremendous lightning storm emanating from a classically-shaped anvil cloud. The long exposure allowed for the capture of many intricate lightning bolts.  Finally, at the top and furthest in the distance are stars.  Here, the multi-minute exposure made stars into trails.  The trailing effect is caused by the rotation of the Earth, and the curvature of the trails indicates their distance from the north spin pole of the Earth above. Taken after sunset in early June, the lightning storm soon moved off.  The stars, though, will continue to circle the pole for as long as the Earth spins -- surely billions of years into the future.","star, trail, lightning, pyrenees, beauty, image, come, layer, bottom, picturesque, village, manlleu, barcelona, spain, six-minute, exposure, make, light, streak, next, mountain, serra, bellmunt, europe, famous, tremendous, storm, emanating, classically-shaped, anvil, cloud, long, allowed, capture, many, intricate, bolt, furthest, distance, multi-minute, made, trailing, effect, caused, rotation, earth, curvature, indicates, north, spin, pole, taken, early, june, moved, continue, circle, year, future"
Star Forming Region NGC 3582 without Stars,"What's happening in the Statue of Liberty nebula?  Bright stars and interesting molecules are forming and being liberated. The complex nebula resides in the star forming region called RCW 57, and besides the iconic monument, to some looks like a flying superhero or a weeping angel.  By digitally removing the stars, this re-assigned color image showcases dense knots of dark interstellar dust, fields of glowing hydrogen gas ionized by these stars, and great loops of gas expelled by dying stars. A detailed study of NGC 3576, also known as NGC 3582 and NGC 3584, uncovered at least 33 massive stars in the end stages of formation, and the clear presence of the complex carbon molecules known as polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs). PAHs are thought to be created in the cooling gas of star forming regions, and their development in the Sun's formation nebula five billion years ago may have been an important step in the development of life on Earth.

The Horsehead Nebula in Infrared from Hubble,"While drifting through the cosmos, a magnificent interstellar dust cloud became sculpted by stellar winds and radiation to assume a recognizable shape.  Fittingly named the Horsehead Nebula, it is embedded in the vast and complex Orion Nebula (M42).  A potentially rewarding but difficult object to view personally with a small telescope, the featured gorgeously detailed image was taken in infrared light by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  The dark molecular cloud, roughly 1,500 light years distant, is cataloged as Barnard 33 and is seen above primarily because it is backlit by the nearby massive star Sigma Orionis. The Horsehead Nebula will slowly shift its apparent shape over the next few million years and will eventually be destroyed by high energy starlight.

NGC 7331 Close Up,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 7331 is often touted as an analog to our own Milky Way. About 50 million light-years distant in the northern constellation Pegasus, NGC 7331 was recognized early on as a spiral nebula and is actually one of the brighter galaxies not included in Charles Messier's famous 18th century catalog. Since the galaxy's disk is inclined to our line-of-sight, long telescopic exposures often result in an image that evokes a strong sense of depth. This Hubble Space Telescope close-up spans some 40,000 light-years. The galaxy's magnificent spiral arms feature dark obscuring dust lanes, bright bluish clusters of massive young stars, and the telltale reddish glow of active star forming regions. The bright yellowish central regions harbor populations of older, cooler stars.

Ringed Ice Giant Neptune,"Ringed, ice giant Neptune lies near the center of this sharp near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope. The dim and distant world is the farthest planet from the Sun, about 30 times farther away than planet Earth. But in the stunning Webb view the planet's dark and ghostly appearance is due to atmospheric methane that absorbs infrared light. High altitude clouds that reach above most of Neptune's absorbing methane easily stand out in the image though. Coated with frozen nitrogen, Neptune's largest moon Triton is brighter than Neptune in reflected sunlight and is seen at upper left sporting the Webb's characteristic diffraction spikes. Including Triton, seven of Neptune's 14 known moons can be identified in the field of view. Neptune's faint rings are striking in this new space-based planetary portrait. Details of the complex ring system are seen here for the first time since Neptune was visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in August 1989.","ringed, giant, neptune, center, sharp, near-infrared, image, james, webb, space, telescope, distant, world, farthest, planet, time, farther, earth, stunning, view, dark, atmospheric, methane, absorbs, infrared, light, high, altitude, cloud, reach, absorbing, stand, coated, frozen, nitrogen, largest, moon, triton, brighter, reflected, sunlight, seen, upper, left, sporting, characteristic, diffraction, spike, including, known, identified, field, faint, ring, striking, space-based, planetary, portrait, detail, complex, system, first, visited, spacecraft, august"
September Sunrise Shadows,"The defining astronomical moment for this September's equinox was on Friday, September 23, 2022 at 01:03 UTC, when the Sun crossed the celestial equator moving south in its yearly journey through planet Earth's sky. That marked the beginning of fall for our fair planet in the northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere, when day and night are nearly equal around the globe.  Of course, if you celebrate the astronomical change of seasons by watching a sunrise you can also look for crepuscular rays. The shadows cast by clouds can have a dramatic appearance in the twilight sky during any sunrise or sunset. Due to perspective, the parallel shadows will seem to point back to the rising Sun and a place due east on your horizon near the equinox date. Taken on September 15, this sunrise sea and skyscape captured crepuscular rays in the sky and watery specular reflections from the Mediterranean coast near the village of Petacciato, Italy.","september, sunrise, shadow, defining, astronomical, moment, equinox, friday, crossed, celestial, equator, moving, journey, planet, earth, marked, beginning, fall, fair, northern, spring, southern, night, equal, globe, course, celebrate, change, season, watching, look, crepuscular, cast, cloud, dramatic, appearance, twilight, sunset, perspective, parallel, seem, point, rising, place, horizon, date, taken, skyscape, captured, watery, specular, reflection, mediterranean, coast, village, petacciato, italy"
The Fairy of Eagle Nebula,"The dust sculptures of the Eagle Nebula are evaporating.  As powerful starlight whittles away these cool cosmic mountains, the statuesque pillars that remain might be imagined as mythical beasts.  Featured here is one of several striking dust pillars of the Eagle Nebula that might be described as a gigantic alien fairy.   This fairy, however, is ten light years tall and spews radiation much hotter than common fire. The greater Eagle Nebula, M16, is actually a giant evaporating shell of gas and dust inside of which is a growing cavity filled with a spectacular stellar nursery currently forming an open cluster of stars.  This great pillar, which is about 7,000 light years away, will likely evaporate away in about 100,000 years.

All the Water on Planet Earth,"How much of planet Earth is made of water? Very little, actually. Although oceans of water cover about 70 percent of Earth's surface, these oceans are shallow compared to the Earth's radius. The featured illustration shows what would happen if all of the water on or near the surface of the Earth were bunched up into a ball. The radius of this ball would be only about 700 kilometers, less than half the radius of the Earth's Moon, but slightly larger than Saturn's moon Rhea which, like many moons in our outer Solar System, is mostly water ice. The next smallest ball depicts all of Earth's liquid fresh water, while the tiniest ball shows the volume of all of Earth's fresh-water lakes and rivers. How any of this water came to be on the Earth and whether any significant amount is trapped far beneath Earth's surface remain topics of research.","water, planet, earth, much, made, little, ocean, cover, percent, surface, shallow, compared, radius, featured, illustration, show, happen, bunched, ball, kilometer, less, half, moon, larger, saturn, rhea, many, solar, system, smallest, depicts, liquid, fresh, tiniest, volume, fresh-water, lake, river, came, significant, amount, trapped, beneath, remain, topic, research"
DART: Impact on Asteroid Dimorphos,"Could humanity deflect an asteroid headed for Earth? Yes.  Deadly impacts from large asteroids have happened before in Earth's past, sometimes causing mass extinctions of life. To help protect our Earth from some potential future impacts, NASA tested a new planetary defense mechanism yesterday by crashing the robotic Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) spacecraft into Dimorphos, a small asteroid spanning about 170-meters across. As shown in the featured video, the impact was a success. Ideally, if impacted early enough, even the kick from a small spacecraft can deflect a large asteroid enough to miss the Earth.  In the video, DART is seen in a time-lapse video first passing larger Didymos, on the left, and then approaching the smaller Dimorphos. Although the video ends abruptly with DART's crash, observations monitoring the changed orbit of Dimorphos -- from spacecraft and telescopes around the world -- have just begun.","dart, impact, asteroid, dimorphos, humanity, deflect, headed, earth, large, happened, past, causing, mass, extinction, life, help, protect, potential, future, tested, planetary, defense, mechanism, yesterday, crashing, robotic, double, redirection, test, spacecraft, small, spanning, 170-meters, shown, featured, video, success, impacted, early, kick, miss, seen, time-lapse, passing, larger, didymos, left, approaching, smaller, crash, observation, monitoring, changed, orbit, telescope, world, begun"
A Furious Sky over Mount Shasta,"Is the sky angry with Mount Shasta? According to some ancient legends, the spirits of above and below worlds fight there, sometimes quite actively during eruptions of this enormous volcano in California, USA.  Such drama can well be imagined in this deep sky image taken in late June. Evident above the snow-covered peak is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, on the left, and a picturesque sky toward the modern constellations of Scorpius and Ophiuchus, above and to the right.  The bright orange star Antares and the colorful rho Ophiuchi cloud complex are visible just to the right of Mount Shasta, while the red emission nebula surrounding the star zeta Ophiuchi appears on the top right.  The static earth image in the featured composite was taken during the blue hour, while a two-panel panorama tracking the background sky was taken later that night with the same camera and from the same location. Within a few million years, Antares, some stars in the rho Ophiuchi system, and zeta Ophiuchi will all likely explode as supernovas.","furious, mount, shasta, angry, according, ancient, legend, spirit, world, fight, actively, eruption, enormous, volcano, california, drama, imagined, deep, image, taken, june, evident, snow-covered, peak, central, band, milky, galaxy, left, picturesque, modern, constellation, scorpius, bright, orange, star, antares, colorful, ophiuchi, cloud, complex, visible, right, emission, surrounding, zeta, appears, static, earth, featured, composite, blue, hour, two-panel, panorama, tracking, background, night, camera, location, year, system, likely, explode, supernova"
DART Asteroid Impact from Space,"Fifteen days before impact, the DART spacecraft deployed a small companion satellite to document its historic planetary defense technology demonstration. Provided by the Italian Space Agency, the Light Italian CubeSat for Imaging Asteroids, aka LICIACube, recorded this image of the event's aftermath. A cloud of ejecta is seen near the right edge of the frame captured only minutes following DART's impact with target asteroid Dimorphos while LICIACube was about 80 kilometers away. Presently about 11 million kilometers from Earth, 160 meter diameter Dimorphos is a moonlet orbiting 780 meter diameter asteroid Didymos. Didymos is seen off center in the LICIACube image. Over the coming weeks, ground-based telescopic observations will look for a small change in Dimorphos' orbit around Didymos to evaluate how effectively the DART impact deflected its target.","dart, asteroid, impact, space, fifteen, spacecraft, deployed, small, companion, satellite, document, historic, planetary, defense, technology, demonstration, provided, italian, agency, light, cubesat, imaging, liciacube, recorded, image, event, aftermath, cloud, ejecta, seen, right, edge, frame, captured, minute, following, target, dimorphos, kilometer, earth, meter, diameter, moonlet, orbiting, didymos, center, coming, week, ground-based, telescopic, observation, look, change, orbit, evaluate, deflected"
Equinox Sunrise Around the World,"A planet-wide collaboration resulted in this remarkable array of sunrise photographs taken around the September 2022 equinox. The images were contributed by 24 photographers, one in each of 24 nautical time zones around the world. Unlike more complicated civil time zone boundaries, the 24 nautical time zones are simply 15 degree longitude bands corresponding to 1 hour steps that span the globe. Start at the upper right for the first to experience a sunrise in the nautical time zone corresponding to Coordinated Universal Time (UTC) + 12 hours. In that time zone, the photographer was located in Christchurch, New Zealand. Travel to the west by looking down the column and then moving to the column toward the left for later sunrises as the time zone offset in hours from UTC decreases. Or, you can watch a video of September 2022 equinox sunrises around planet Earth.","equinox, sunrise, world, planet-wide, collaboration, resulted, remarkable, array, photograph, taken, september, image, contributed, photographer, nautical, time, zone, complicated, civil, boundary, degree, longitude, band, corresponding, hour, step, span, globe, start, upper, right, coordinated, universal, located, christchurch, zealand, travel, west, looking, column, moving, left, offset, decrease, watch, video, planet, earth"
Lunation Matrix,"Observe the Moon every night and you'll see its visible sunlit portion gradually change. In phases progressing from New Moon to Full Moon to New Moon again, a lunar cycle or lunation is completed in about 29.5 days. Top left to bottom right, this 7x4 matrix of telescopic images captures the range of lunar phases for 28 consecutive nights, from the evening of July 29 to the morning of August 26, following an almost complete lunation. No image was taken 24 hours or so just after and just before New Moon, when the lunar phase is at best a narrow crescent, close to the Sun and really hard to see. Finding mostly clear Mediterranean skies required an occasional road trip to complete this lunar cycle project, imaging in early evening for the first half and late evening and early morning for the second half of the lunation. Since all the images are registered at the same scale you can use this matrix to track the change in the Moon's apparent size during the single lunation. For extra credit, find the lunar phase that occurred closest to perigee.

Supernova Cannon Expels Pulsar J0002,"What could shoot out a neutron star like a cannon ball? A supernova.  About 10,000 years ago, the supernova that created the nebular remnant CTB 1 not only destroyed a massive star but blasted its newly formed neutron star core -- a pulsar -- out into the Milky Way Galaxy.  The pulsar, spinning 8.7 times a second, was discovered using downloadable software Einstein@Home searching through data taken by NASA's orbiting Fermi Gamma-Ray Observatory.  Traveling over 1,000 kilometers per second, the pulsar PSR J0002+6216 (J0002 for short) has already left the supernova remnant CTB 1, and is even fast enough to leave our Galaxy. Pictured, the trail of the pulsar is visible extending to the lower left of the supernova remnant.  The featured image is a combination of radio images from the VLA and DRAO radio observatories, as well as data archived from NASA's orbiting IRAS infrared observatory. It is well known that supernovas can act as cannons, and even that pulsars can act as cannonballs -- what is not known is how supernovas do it.","supernova, cannon, expels, pulsar, j0002, shoot, star, ball, year, created, nebular, remnant, destroyed, massive, blasted, formed, neutron, core, milky, galaxy, spinning, time, second, discovered, using, downloadable, software, einstein, home, searching, data, taken, nasa, orbiting, fermi, gamma-ray, observatory, traveling, kilometer, j0002+6216, short, left, enough, leave, pictured, trail, visible, extending, lower, featured, image, combination, radio, drao, archived, infrared, known, cannonball"
Jupiter's Europa from Spacecraft Juno,"What mysteries might be solved by peering into this crystal ball?  In this case, the ball is actually a moon of Jupiter, the crystals are ice, and the moon is not only dirty but cracked beyond repair.  Nevertheless, speculation is rampant that oceans exist under Europa's fractured ice-plains that could support life.  Europa, roughly the size of Earth's Moon, is pictured here in an image taken a few days ago when the Jupiter-orbiting robotic spacecraft Juno passed within 325 kilometers of its streaked and shifting surface. Underground oceans are thought likely because Europa undergoes global flexing due to its changing gravitational attraction with Jupiter during its slightly elliptical orbit, and this flexing heats the interior. Studying Juno's close-up images may further humanity's understanding not only of Europa and the early Solar System but also of the possibility that life exists elsewhere in the universe.","jupiter, europa, spacecraft, juno, mystery, solved, peering, crystal, ball, case, moon, dirty, cracked, repair, nevertheless, speculation, rampant, ocean, exist, fractured, ice-plains, support, life, size, earth, pictured, image, taken, jupiter-orbiting, robotic, passed, kilometer, streaked, shifting, surface, underground, thought, undergoes, global, flexing, changing, gravitational, attraction, elliptical, orbit, heat, interior, studying, close-up, humanity, understanding, early, solar, system, possibility, exists, universe"
Star-Forming Eagle Nebula without Stars,"The whole thing looks like an eagle.  A closer look at the Eagle Nebula's center, however, shows the bright region is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust.  Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appears where a whole open cluster of stars is being formed.  In this cavity tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gas remain where stars are still forming.  Paradoxically, it is perhaps easier to appreciate this impressive factory of star formation by seeing it without its stars -- which have been digitally removed in the featured image. The Eagle emission nebula, tagged M16, lies about 6500 light years away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Serpent (Serpens).  Creating this picture involved over 22 hours of imaging and combining colors emitted specifically by hydrogen (red), and oxygen (blue).","star-forming, eagle, nebula, star, whole, thing, look, closer, center, show, bright, region, window, larger, dark, shell, dust, brightly-lit, workshop, appears, open, cluster, formed, cavity, tall, pillar, round, globule, cold, molecular, remain, forming, easier, appreciate, impressive, factory, formation, seeing, removed, featured, image, emission, tagged, light, year, span, light-year, visible, binoculars, constellation, serpent, serpens, creating, picture, involved, hour, imaging, combining, color, emitted, hydrogen, oxygen, blue"
Expanding Plume from DART's Impact,"What happens if you crash a spaceship into an asteroid? In the case of NASA's DART spaceship and the small asteroid Dimorphos, as happened last week, you get quite a plume. The goal of the planned impact was planetary protection -- to show that the path of an asteroid can be slightly altered, so that, if done right, a big space rock will miss the Earth. The high brightness of the plume, though, was unexpected by many, and what it means remains a topic of research. One possibility is that 170-meter wide Dimorphos is primarily a rubble pile asteroid and the collision dispersed some of the rubble in the pile.  The featured time-lapse video covers about 20 minutes and was taken from the Les Makes Observatory on France's Reunion Island, off the southeast coast of southern Africa.  One of many Earth-based observatories following the impact, the initial dot is primarily Dimorphos's larger companion: asteroid Didymos. 	 Most recently, images show that the Didymos - Dimorphos system has developed comet-like tails.

NGC 4631: The Whale Galaxy,"NGC 4631 is a big beautiful spiral galaxy. Seen edge-on, it lies only 25 million light-years away in the well-trained northern constellation Canes Venatici. The galaxy's slightly distorted wedge shape suggests to some a cosmic herring and to others its popular moniker, The Whale Galaxy. Either way, it is similar in size to our own Milky Way. In this sharp color image, the galaxy's yellowish core, dark dust clouds, bright blue star clusters, and red star forming regions are easy to spot. A companion galaxy, the small elliptical NGC 4627 is just above the Whale Galaxy. Faint star streams seen in deep images are the remnants of small companion galaxies disrupted by repeated encounters with the Whale in the distant past. The Whale Galaxy is also known to have spouted a halo of hot gas glowing in X-rays.","whale, galaxy, beautiful, spiral, seen, edge-on, light-year, well-trained, northern, constellation, cane, venatici, distorted, wedge, shape, suggests, cosmic, herring, others, popular, moniker, similar, size, milky, sharp, color, image, yellowish, core, dark, dust, cloud, bright, blue, star, cluster, forming, region, easy, spot, companion, small, elliptical, faint, stream, deep, remnant, disrupted, repeated, distant, past, known, spouted, halo, glowing, x-ray"
In Ganymede's Shadow,"At opposition, opposite the Sun in Earth's sky, late last month Jupiter is also approaching perihelion, the closest point to the Sun in its elliptical orbit, early next year. That makes Jupiter exceptionally close to our fair planet, currently resulting in excellent views of the Solar System's ruling gas giant. On September 27, this sharp image of Jupiter was recorded with a small telescope from a backyard in Florence, Arizona. The stacked video frames reveal the massive world bounded by planet girdling winds. Dark belts and light zones span the gas giant, along with rotating oval storms and its signature Great Red Spot. Galilean moon Ganymede is below and right in the frame. The Solar System's largest moon and its shadow are in transit across the southern Jovian cloud tops.","ganymede, shadow, opposition, opposite, earth, last, month, jupiter, approaching, perihelion, closest, point, elliptical, orbit, early, next, year, make, close, fair, planet, resulting, excellent, view, solar, system, ruling, giant, september, sharp, image, recorded, small, telescope, backyard, florence, arizona, stacked, video, frame, reveal, massive, world, bounded, girdling, wind, dark, belt, light, span, rotating, oval, storm, signature, great, spot, galilean, moon, right, largest, transit, southern, jovian, cloud"
Two Comets in Southern Skies,"Heading for its closest approach to the Sun or perihelion on December 20, comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) remains a sight for telescopic observers as it sweeps through planet Earth's southern hemisphere skies.  First time visitor from the remote Oort cloud this comet PanSTARRS sports a greenish coma and whitish dust tail about half a degree long at the upper left in a deep image from September 21. It also shares the starry field of view toward the constellation Scorpius with another comet, 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3, seen about 1 degree below and right of PanSTARRS. Astronomers estimate that first time visitor comet C/2017 K2 (PanSTARRS) has been inbound from the Oort cloud for some 3 million years along a hyperbolic orbit. Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 is more familiar though.  The periodic comet loops through its own elliptical orbit, from just beyond the orbit of Jupiter to the vicinity of Earth's orbit, once every 5.4 years. Just passing in the night, this comet PanSTARRS is about 20 light-minutes from Earth in the September 21 image. Seen to be disintegrating since 1995, Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 was about 7.8 light-minutes away.","comet, southern, heading, closest, approach, perihelion, december, c/2017, panstarrs, remains, sight, telescopic, sweep, planet, earth, hemisphere, first, time, visitor, remote, oort, cloud, sport, greenish, coma, whitish, dust, tail, half, degree, upper, left, deep, image, september, share, starry, field, view, constellation, scorpius, 73p/schwassmann-wachmann, seen, astronomer, estimate, inbound, year, hyperbolic, orbit, schwassmann-wachmann, familiar, periodic, loop, elliptical, jupiter, vicinity, passing, night, light-minutes, disintegrating"
Auroras over Northern Canada,"Gusting solar winds and blasts of charged particles from the Sun resulted in several rewarding nights of auroras back in 2014 December, near the peak of the last 11-year solar cycle.  The featured image captured dramatic auroras stretching across a sky near the town of Yellowknife in northern Canada.  The auroras were so bright that they not only inspired awe, but were easily visible on an image exposure of only 1.3 seconds. A video taken concurrently shows the dancing sky lights evolving in real time as tourists, many there just to see auroras, respond with cheers. The conical dwellings on the image right are tipis, while far in the background, near the image center, is the constellation of Orion.  Auroras may increase again over the next few years as our Sun again approaches solar maximum.","aurora, northern, canada, gusting, solar, wind, blast, charged, particle, resulted, several, rewarding, night, december, peak, last, 11-year, cycle, featured, image, captured, dramatic, stretching, town, yellowknife, bright, inspired, visible, exposure, second, video, taken, show, dancing, light, evolving, real, time, tourist, many, respond, cheer, conical, dwelling, right, tipi, background, center, constellation, orion, increase, next, year, approach, maximum"
A Double Lunar Analemma over Turkey,"An analemma is that figure-8 curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun at the same time each day for one year. But the trick to imaging an analemma of the Moon is to wait bit longer. On average the Moon returns to the same position in the sky about 50 minutes and 29 seconds later each day. So photograph the Moon 50 minutes 29 seconds later on successive days. Over one lunation or lunar month it will trace out an analemma-like curve as the Moon's actual position wanders due to its tilted and elliptical orbit. Since the featured image was taken over two months, it actually shows a double lunar analemma.  Crescent lunar phases too thin and faint to capture around the New moon are missing. The two months the persistent astrophotographer chose were during a good stretch of weather during July and August, and the location was Kayseri, Turkey","double, lunar, analemma, turkey, figure-8, curve, mark, position, time, year, trick, imaging, moon, wait, longer, average, return, minute, second, photograph, successive, lunation, month, trace, analemma-like, actual, wanders, tilted, elliptical, orbit, featured, image, taken, show, crescent, phase, thin, faint, capture, missing, persistent, chose, good, stretch, weather, july, august, location, kayseri"
"Stars, Dust, Pillars, and Jets in the Pelican Nebula","What dark structures arise within the Pelican Nebula? On the whole, the nebula appears like a bird (a pelican) and is seen toward the constellation of a different bird: Cygnus, a Swan. But inside, the Pelican Nebula is a place lit up by new stars and befouled by dark dust. Smoke-sized dust grains start as simple carbon compounds formed in the cool atmospheres of young stars but are dispersed by stellar winds and explosions.  Two impressive Herbig-Haro jets are seen emitted by the star HH 555 on the right, and these jets are helping to destroy the light year-long dust pillar that contains it.  Other pillars and jets are also visible. The featured image was scientifically-colored to emphasize light emitted by small amounts of heavy elements in a nebula made predominantly of the light elements hydrogen and helium.  The Pelican Nebula (IC 5067 and IC 5070) is about 2,000 light-years away and can be found with a small telescope to the northeast of the bright star Deneb.

Ou4: The Giant Squid Nebula,"A mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud, this nebula is very faint, but also very large in planet Earth's sky. In the image, composed with 30 hours of narrowband image data, it spans nearly three full moons toward the royal constellation Cepheus. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula's bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue-green emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, a more recent investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across.","giant, squid, mysterious, squid-like, cosmic, cloud, nebula, faint, large, planet, earth, image, composed, hour, narrowband, data, span, full, moon, royal, constellation, cepheus, discovered, french, astro-imager, nicolas, outters, bipolar, shape, distinguished, telltale, blue-green, emission, ionized, oxygen, atom, surrounded, reddish, hydrogen, region, sh2-129, true, distance, nature, difficult, determine, recent, investigation, suggests, light-year, consistent, scenario, represent, spectacular, material, driven, triple, system, massive, star, cataloged, hr8119, seen, center"
Dust Shells around WR 140 from Webb,"What are those strange rings? Rich in dust, the rings are likely 3D shells -- but how they were created remains a topic of research.  Where they were created is well known: in a binary star system that lies about 6,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) -- a system dominated by the Wolf-Rayet star WR 140.  Wolf-Rayet stars are massive, bright, and known for their tumultuous winds. They are also known for creating and dispersing heavy elements such as carbon  which is a building block of interstellar dust. The other star in the binary is also bright and massive -- but not as active.  The two great stars joust in an oblong orbit as they approach each other about every eight years. When at closest approach, the X-ray emission from the system increases, as, apparently, does the dust expelled into space -- creating another shell.  The featured infrared image by the new Webb Space Telescope resolves greater details and more dust shells than ever before.","dust, shell, webb, strange, ring, rich, likely, created, remains, topic, research, known, binary, star, system, light, year, constellation, swan, cygnus, dominated, wolf-rayet, massive, bright, tumultuous, wind, creating, dispersing, heavy, element, carbon, building, block, interstellar, active, great, joust, oblong, orbit, approach, closest, x-ray, emission, increase, expelled, space, featured, infrared, image, telescope, resolve, greater, detail"
The Falcon and the Hunter's Moon,"The Full Moon of October 9th was the second Full Moon after the northern hemisphere autumnal equinox, traditionally called the Hunter's Moon. According to lore, the name is a fitting one because this Full Moon lights the night during a time for hunting in preparation for the coming winter months. In this snapshot, a nearly full Hunter's Moon was captured just after sunset on October 8, rising in skies over Florida's Space Coast. Rising from planet Earth a Falcon 9 rocket pierces the bright lunar disk from the photographer's vantage point. Ripples and fringes along the edge of the lunar disk appear as supersonic shock waves generated by the rocket's passage change the atmosphere's index of refraction.","falcon, hunter, moon, full, october, second, northern, autumnal, equinox, called, according, name, fitting, light, night, time, hunting, preparation, coming, winter, month, snapshot, captured, sunset, rising, florida, space, coast, planet, earth, rocket, pierce, bright, lunar, disk, photographer, vantage, point, ripple, fringe, edge, appear, supersonic, shock, wave, generated, passage, change, index, refraction"
GRB 221009A,"Gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A likely signals the birth of a new black hole, formed at the core of a collapsing star long ago in the distant universe. The extremely powerful blast is depicted in this animated gif constructed using data from the Fermi Gamma Ray Space Telescope. Fermi captured the data at gamma-ray energies, detecting photons with over 100 million electron volts. In comparison visible light photons have energies of about 2 electron volts. A steady, high energy gamma-ray glow from the plane of our Milky Way galaxy runs diagonally through the 20 degree wide frame at the left, while the transient gamma-ray flash from GRB 221009A appears at center and then fades. One of the brightest gamma-ray bursts ever detected GRB 221009A is also close as far as gamma-ray bursts go, but still lies about 2 billion light-years away.

Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1300,"Across the center of this spiral galaxy is a bar.  And at the center of this bar is smaller spiral.  And at the center of that spiral is a supermassive black hole.  This all happens in the big, beautiful, barred spiral galaxy cataloged as NGC 1300, a galaxy that lies some 70 million light-years away toward the constellation of the river Eridanus. This Hubble Space Telescope composite view of the gorgeous island universe is one of the most detailed Hubble images ever made of a complete galaxy.  NGC 1300 spans over 100,000 light-years and the Hubble image reveals striking details of the galaxy's dominant central bar and majestic spiral arms.

X-Ray Rings Around a Gamma Ray Burst,"Why would x-ray rings appear around a gamma-ray burst?  The surprising answer has little to do with the explosion itself but rather with light reflected off areas of dust-laden gas in our own Milky Way Galaxy.  GRB 221009A was a tremendous explosion -- a very bright gamma-ray burst (GRB) that occurred far across the universe with radiation just arriving in our Solar System last week.  Since GRBs can also emit copious amounts of x-rays, a bright flash of x-rays arrived nearly simultaneously with the gamma-radiation. In this case, the X-rays also bounced off regions high in dust right here in our Milky Way Galaxy, creating the unusual reflections. The greater the angle between reflecting Milky Way dust and the GRB, the greater the radius of the X-ray rings, and, typically, the longer it takes for these light-echoes to arrive.","x-ray, ring, gamma, burst, appear, gamma-ray, surprising, answer, little, explosion, light, reflected, area, dust-laden, milky, galaxy, tremendous, bright, occurred, universe, radiation, arriving, solar, system, last, week, grbs, copious, amount, flash, arrived, gamma-radiation, case, bounced, region, high, dust, creating, unusual, reflection, greater, angle, reflecting, radius, take, light-echoes, arrive"
Milky Way Auroral Flower,"Could the stem of our Milky Way bloom into an auroral flower? No, not really, even though it may appear that way in today’s featured all-sky image.  On the left, the central plane of our home galaxy extends from the horizon past the middle of the sky. On the right, an auroral oval also extends from the sky's center -- but is dominated by bright green-glowing oxygen. The two are not physically connected, because the aurora is relatively nearby, with the higher red parts occurring in Earth's atmosphere only about 1000 kilometers high. In contrast, an average distance to the stars and nebulas we see in the Milky Way more like 1000 light-years away - 10 trillion times further.  The featured image composite was taken in early October across a small lake in Abisko, northern Sweden. As our Sun's magnetic field evolves into the active part of its 11-year cycle, auroras near both of Earth's poles are sure to become more frequent.","milky, auroral, flower, stem, appear, today, featured, all-sky, image, left, central, plane, home, galaxy, extends, horizon, middle, right, oval, center, dominated, bright, green-glowing, oxygen, connected, aurora, nearby, higher, part, occurring, earth, atmosphere, kilometer, high, contrast, average, distance, star, nebula, light-year, time, composite, taken, early, october, small, lake, abisko, northern, sweden, magnetic, field, evolves, active, 11-year, cycle, pole, sure, become, frequent"
"A Galaxy Beyond Stars, Gas, Dust","Do we dare believe our eyes?  When we look at images of space, we often wonder whether they are ""real"", and just as often the best answer varies.  In this case, the scene appears much as our eyes would see it, because it was obtained using  RGB (Red, Green, Blue) filters like the cone cells in our eyes, except collecting light for 19 hours, not a fraction of a second.  The featured image was captured over six nights, using a 24-inch diameter telescope in the Sierra Nevada Mountains, in California, USA. The bright spiral galaxy at the center (NGC 7497) looks like it is being grasped by an eerie tendril of a space ghost, and therein lies the trick. The galaxy is actually 59 million light years away, while the nebulosity is MBM 54, less than one thousand light years away, making it one of the nearest cool clouds of gas and dust -- galactic cirrus -- within our own Milky Way Galaxy.  Both are in the constellation of Pegasus, which can be seen high overhead from northern latitudes in the autumn.","galaxy, star, dust, dare, believe, look, image, space, wonder, real, best, answer, varies, case, scene, appears, much, obtained, using, green, blue, filter, cone, cell, collecting, light, hour, fraction, second, featured, captured, night, 24-inch, diameter, telescope, sierra, nevada, mountain, california, bright, spiral, center, grasped, eerie, tendril, ghost, therein, trick, year, nebulosity, less, thousand, making, nearest, cool, cloud, galactic, cirrus, milky, constellation, pegasus, seen, high, overhead, northern, latitude, autumn"
Pillars of Creation,"A now famous picture from the Hubble Space Telescope featured these star forming columns of cold gas and dust light-years long inside M16, the Eagle Nebula, dubbed the Pillars of Creation. This James Webb Space Telescope NIRCam image expands Hubble's exploration of that region in greater detail and depth inside the iconic stellar nursery. Particularly stunning in Webb's near infrared view is the telltale reddish emission from knots of material undergoing gravitational collapse to form stars within the natal clouds. The Eagle Nebula is some 6,500 light-years distant. The larger bright emission nebula is itself an easy target for binoculars or small telescopes.

Andromeda in Southern Skies,"Looking north from southern New Zealand, the Andromeda Galaxy never gets more than about five degrees above the horizon. As spring comes to the southern hemisphere, in late September Andromeda is highest in the sky around midnight though. In a single 30 second exposure this telephoto image tracked the stars to capture the closest large spiral galaxy from Mount John Observatory as it climbed just over the rugged peaks of the south island's Southern Alps. In the foreground, stars are reflected in the still waters of Lake Alexandrina. Also known as M31, the Andromeda Galaxy is one of the brightest objects in the Messier catalog, usually visible to the unaided eye as a small, faint, fuzzy patch.

NGC 1499: The California Nebula,"Drifting through the Orion Arm of the spiral Milky Way Galaxy, this cosmic cloud by chance echoes the outline of California on the west coast of the United States. Our own Sun also lies within the Milky Way's Orion Arm, only about 1,500 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. The California Nebula shines with the telltale reddish glow characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons. The electrons have been stripped away, ionized by energetic starlight. Most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot star Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula.

Clouds Around Galaxy Andromeda,"What are those red clouds surrounding the Andromeda galaxy? This galaxy, M31, is often imaged by planet Earth-based astronomers. As the nearest large spiral galaxy, it is a familiar sight with dark dust lanes, bright yellowish core, and spiral arms traced by clouds of bright blue stars.  A mosaic of well-exposed broad and narrow-band image data, this deep portrait of our neighboring island universe offers strikingly unfamiliar features though, faint reddish clouds of glowing ionized hydrogen gas in the same wide field of view. Most of the ionized hydrogen clouds surely lie in the foreground of the scene, well within our Milky Way Galaxy. They are likely associated with the pervasive, dusty interstellar cirrus clouds scattered hundreds of light-years above our own galactic plane.

Jupiter Rotates as Moons Orbit,"Jupiter and its moons move like our Sun and its planets. Similarly, Jupiter spins while its moons circle around. Jupiter’s rotation can be observed by tracking circulating dark belts and light zones. The Great Red Spot, the largest storm known, rotates to become visible after about 15 seconds in the 48-second time lapse video. The video is a compilation of shorts taken over several nights last month and combined into a digital recreation of how 24-continuous hours would appear. Jupiter's brightest moons always orbit in the plane of the planet's rotation, even as Earth’s spin makes the whole system appear to tilt.  The moons Europa, Ganymede, and Io are all visible, with Europa's shadow appearing as the icy Galilean moon crosses Jupiter's disk.  Jupiter remains near opposition this month, meaning that it is unusually bright, near to its closest to the Earth, and visible nearly all night long.

Cocoon Nebula Wide Field,"When does a nebula look like a comet?  In this crowded starfield, covering over two degrees within the high flying constellation of the Swan (Cygnus), the eye is drawn to the Cocoon Nebula. A compact star forming region, the cosmic Cocoon punctuates a nebula bright in emission and reflection on the left, with a long trail of interstellar dust clouds to the right, making the entire complex appear a bit like a comet. Cataloged as IC 5146, the central bright head of the nebula spans about 10 light years, while the dark dusty tail spans nearly 100 light years.  Both are located about 2,500 light years away. The bright star near the bright nebula's center, likely only a few hundred thousand years old, supplies power to the nebular glow as it helps clear out a cavity in the molecular cloud's star forming dust and gas. The long dusty filaments of the tail, although dark in this visible light image, are themselves hiding stars in the process of formation, stars that can be seen at infrared wavelengths.","cocoon, nebula, wide, field, look, comet, crowded, starfield, covering, degree, high, flying, constellation, swan, cygnus, drawn, compact, star, forming, region, cosmic, punctuates, bright, emission, reflection, left, long, trail, interstellar, dust, cloud, right, making, entire, complex, appear, cataloged, central, head, span, light, year, dark, dusty, tail, located, center, supply, power, nebular, glow, help, clear, cavity, molecular, filament, visible, image, hiding, process, formation, seen, infrared, wavelength"

The famous comet made its last appearance to the naked-eye in 1986. But dusty debris from Comet Halley can be seen raining through planet Earth's skies twice a year during two annual meteor showers, the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October. Including meteors near the shower maximum on October 21, this composite view compiles Orionid meteors captured from years 2015 through 2022. About 47 bright meteors are registered in the panoramic night skyscape. Against a starry background extending along the Milky Way, the Orionid meteors all seem to radiate from a point just north of Betelgeuse in the familiar constellation of the Hunter. In the foreground are mountains in eastern Slovakia near the city of Presov.","year, halley, dust, history, first, known, periodic, comet, return, inner, solar, system, famous, made, last, appearance, naked-eye, dusty, debris, seen, raining, planet, earth, annual, meteor, shower, aquarids, orionids, including, maximum, october, composite, view, compiles, orionid, captured, bright, registered, panoramic, night, skyscape, starry, extending, milky, seem, radiate, point, north, betelgeuse, familiar, constellation, hunter, foreground, mountain, eastern, slovakia, city, presov"
LDN 673: Dark Clouds in Aquila,"Part of a dark expanse that splits the crowded plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the Aquila Rift arcs through planet Earth's skies near bright star Altair. In eerie silhouette against the Milky Way's faint starlight, its dusty molecular clouds likely contain raw material to form hundreds of thousands of stars and astronomers search the dark clouds for telltale signs of star birth. This telescopic close-up looks toward the region at a fragmented Aquila dark cloud complex identified as LDN 673, stretching across a field of view slightly wider than the full moon. In the scene, visible indications of energetic outflows associated with young stars include the small red tinted nebulosity RNO 109 above and right of center, and Herbig-Haro object HH32 below. These dark clouds might look scary, but they're estimated to be some 600 light-years away.

Night on a Spooky Planet,"What spooky planet is this? Planet Earth of course, on a dark and stormy night in 2013 at Hverir, a geothermally active area along the volcanic landscape in northeastern Iceland. Triggered by solar activity, geomagnetic storms produced the auroral display in the starry night sky. The ghostly towers of steam and gas are venting from fumaroles and danced against the eerie greenish light. For now, auroral apparitions are increasing as our Sun approaches a maximum in its 11 year solar activity cycle. And pretty soon, ghostly shapes may dance in your neighborhood too.","night, spooky, planet, earth, course, dark, stormy, hverir, active, area, volcanic, landscape, northeastern, iceland, triggered, solar, activity, geomagnetic, storm, produced, auroral, display, starry, tower, steam, venting, fumaroles, danced, eerie, greenish, light, apparition, increasing, approach, maximum, year, cycle, shape, dance, neighborhood"
LDN 43: The Cosmic Bat Nebula,"What is the most spook-tacular nebula in the galaxy?   One contender is LDN 43, which bears an astonishing resemblance to a vast cosmic bat flying amongst the stars on a dark Halloween night.  Located about 1400 light years away in the constellation Ophiuchus, this molecular cloud is dense enough to block light not only from background stars, but from wisps of gas lit up by the nearby reflection nebula LBN 7.  Far from being a harbinger of death, this 12-light year-long filament of gas and dust is actually a stellar nursery.  Glowing with eerie light, the bat is lit up from inside by dense gaseous knots that have just formed young stars.

NGC 6357: The Lobster Nebula,"Why is the Lobster Nebula forming some of the most massive stars known? No one is yet sure.  Cataloged as NGC 6357, the Lobster Nebula houses the open star cluster Pismis 24 near its center -- a home to unusually bright and massive stars.  The overall red glow near the inner star forming region results from the emission of ionized hydrogen gas.   The surrounding nebula, featured here, holds a complex tapestry of gas, dark dust, stars still forming, and newly born stars.  The intricate patterns are caused by complex interactions between interstellar winds, radiation pressures, magnetic fields, and gravity.  The image was taken with DOE's Dark Energy Camera on the 4-meter Blanco Telescope at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile. NGC 6357 spans about 400 light years and lies about 8,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Scorpion.","lobster, nebula, forming, massive, star, known, sure, cataloged, house, open, cluster, pismis, center, home, bright, overall, glow, inner, region, result, emission, ionized, hydrogen, surrounding, featured, hold, complex, tapestry, dark, dust, born, intricate, pattern, caused, interaction, interstellar, wind, radiation, pressure, magnetic, field, gravity, image, taken, energy, camera, 4-meter, blanco, telescope, cerro, inter-american, observatory, chile, span, light, year, constellation, scorpion"
A Partial Eclipse of an Active Sun,"Watch for three things in this unusual eclipse video.  First, watch for a big dark circle to approach from the right to block out more and more of the Sun. This dark circle is the Moon, and the video was made primarily to capture this partial solar eclipse last week. Next, watch a large solar prominence hover and shimmer over the Sun's edge. A close look will show that part of it is actually falling back to the Sun. The prominence is made of hot plasma that is temporarily held aloft by the Sun's changing magnetic field. Finally, watch the Sun's edge waver. What is wavering is a dynamic carpet of hot gas tubes rising and falling through the Sun's chromosphere -- tubes known as spicules. The entire 4-second time-lapse video covers a time of about ten minutes, although the Sun itself is expected to last another 5 billion years.

M33: The Triangulum Galaxy,"The small, northern constellation Triangulum harbors this magnificent face-on spiral galaxy, M33. Its popular names include the Pinwheel Galaxy or just the Triangulum Galaxy. M33 is over 50,000 light-years in diameter, third largest in the Local Group of galaxies after the Andromeda Galaxy (M31), and our own Milky Way. About 3 million light-years from the Milky Way, M33 is itself thought to be a satellite of the Andromeda Galaxy and astronomers in these two galaxies would likely have spectacular views of each other's grand spiral star systems. As for the view from the Milky Way, this sharp image combines data from telescopes on and around planet Earth to show off M33's blue star clusters and pinkish star forming regions along the galaxy's loosely wound spiral arms. In fact, the cavernous NGC 604 is the brightest star forming region, seen here at about the 1 o'clock position from the galaxy center. Like M31, M33's population of well-measured variable stars have helped make this nearby spiral a cosmic yardstick for establishing the distance scale of the Universe.","triangulum, galaxy, small, northern, constellation, harbor, magnificent, face-on, spiral, popular, name, include, pinwheel, light-year, diameter, third, largest, local, group, milky, thought, andromeda, astronomer, spectacular, view, grand, star, system, sharp, image, combine, data, telescope, planet, earth, show, blue, cluster, pinkish, forming, region, wound, fact, cavernous, brightest, seen, o'clock, position, center, population, well-measured, variable, helped, make, nearby, cosmic, yardstick, establishing, distance, scale, universe"
InSight's Final Selfie,"The Mars InSight lander returned its first image from the Red Planet's flat, equatorial Elysium Planitia after a successful touchdown on November 26, 2018. The history making mission to explore the martian Interior using Seismic investigations, geodesy, and heat transport has been operating for over 1,400 martian days or sols. In that time the InSight mission has detected more than 1,300 marsquakes and recorded data from Mars-shaking meteoroid impacts, observing how the seismic waves travel to provide a glimpse inside Mars. Analyzing the archive of data collected is expected to yield discoveries for decades. But InSight's final operational sol is likely not far off. The reason is evident in this selfie recorded earlier this year showing its deck and large, 2-meter-wide solar panels covered with dust. Kicked up by martian winds the dust continues to accumulate and drastically reduce the power that can be generated by InSight's solar panels.","insight, final, selfie, lander, returned, first, image, planet, flat, equatorial, elysium, planitia, successful, touchdown, history, making, mission, martian, interior, using, seismic, investigation, geodesy, heat, transport, operating, time, detected, marsquakes, recorded, data, mars-shaking, meteoroid, impact, observing, wave, travel, provide, glimpse, analyzing, archive, collected, expected, yield, discovery, decade, operational, reason, evident, year, showing, deck, large, 2-meter-wide, solar, panel, covered, dust, kicked, wind, continues, accumulate, reduce, power, generated"
Lunar Eclipse at the South Pole,"Last May 16 the Moon slid through Earth's shadow, completely immersed in the planet's dark umbra for about 1 hour and 25 minutes during a total lunar eclipse. In this composited timelapse view, the partial and total phases of the eclipse were captured as the Moon tracked above the horizon from Amundsen-Scott South Pole Station. There it shared a cold and starry south polar night with a surging display of the aurora australis and central Milky Way. In the foreground are the BICEP (right) and South Pole telescopes at the southernmost station's Dark Sector Laboratory. But while polar skies can be spectacular, you won't want to go to the South Pole to view the total lunar eclipse coming up on November 8. Instead, that eclipse can be seen from locations in Asia, Australia, the Americas and the Pacific. It will be your last chance to watch a total lunar eclipse until 2025.","lunar, eclipse, south, pole, last, moon, slid, earth, shadow, immersed, planet, dark, umbra, hour, minute, total, composited, timelapse, view, partial, phase, captured, tracked, horizon, amundsen-scott, station, shared, cold, starry, polar, night, surging, display, aurora, australis, central, milky, foreground, bicep, telescope, southernmost, sector, laboratory, spectacular, want, coming, seen, location, asia, australia, america, pacific, chance, watch"
Dark Ball in Inverted Starfield,"Does this strange dark ball look somehow familiar? If so, that might be because it is our Sun. In the featured image from 2012, a detailed solar view was captured originally in a very specific color of red light, then rendered in black and white, and then color inverted. Once complete, the resulting image was added to a starfield, then also color inverted. Visible in the image of the Sun are long light filaments, dark active regions, prominences peeking around the edge, and a moving carpet of hot gas. The surface of our Sun can be a busy place, in particular during Solar Maximum, the time when its surface magnetic field is wound up the most. Besides an active Sun being so picturesque, the plasma expelled can also become picturesque when it impacts the Earth's magnetosphere and creates auroras.

A Total Lunar Eclipse Over Tajikistan,"If the full Moon suddenly faded, what would you see? The answer was recorded in a dramatic time lapse video taken during the total lunar eclipse in 2011 from Tajikistan. During a total lunar eclipse, the Earth moves between the Moon and the Sun, causing the moon to fade dramatically. The Moon never gets completely dark, though, since the Earth's atmosphere refracts some light. As the featured video begins, the scene may appear to be daytime and sunlit, but actually it is a nighttime and lit by the glow of the full Moon. As the Moon becomes eclipsed and fades, background stars become visible and here can be seen reflected in a lake. Most spectacularly, the sky surrounding the eclipsed moon suddenly appears to be full of stars and highlighted by the busy plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. The sequence repeats with a closer view, and the final image shows the placement of the eclipsed Moon near the Eagle, Swan, Trifid, and Lagoon nebulas. Nearly two hours after the eclipse started, the moon emerged from the Earth's shadow and its bright full glare again dominated the sky. Later today or tomorrow, depending on your location relative to the International Date Line, a new  total lunar eclipse will take place -- with totality being primarily visible over northeastern Asia and northwestern North America.

Galaxies: Wild's Triplet from Hubble,"How many galaxies are interacting here?  This grouping of galaxies is called the Wild Triplet, not only for the discoverer, but for the number of bright galaxies that appear. It had been assumed that all three galaxies, collectively cataloged as Arp 248, are interacting, but more recent investigations reveal that only the brightest two galaxies are sparring gravitationally: the big galaxies at the top and bottom. The spiral galaxy in the middle of the featured image by the  Hubble Space Telescope is actually far in the distance, as is the galaxy just below it and all of the other numerous galaxies in the field.  A striking result of these giants jousting is a tremendous bridge of stars, gas, and dust that stretches between them -- a bridge almost 200,000 light-years long. Light we see today from Wild's Triplet left about 200 million years ago, when dinosaurs roamed the Earth. In perhaps a billion years or so, the two interacting galaxies will merge to form a single large spiral galaxy.

The Asymmetric Nebula Surrounding Wolf-Rayet Star 18,"Why does the nebula around the star WR-18 shine brighter on one side? Also known as NGC 3199, this active star and its surrounding nebula lie about 12,000 light-years away toward the nautical southern constellation of Carina. The featured deep image has been highly processed to bring out filamentary details of the glowing gas in the bubble-shaped nebula.  The nebula is about 75 light-years across. Near the nebula's center is a Wolf-Rayet star, WR-18, which is a massive, hot, short-lived star that generates an intense and complex stellar wind. In fact, Wolf-Rayet stars are known to create nebulas with interesting shapes as their powerful winds sweep up surrounding interstellar material. In this case, the bright right edge was initially thought to indicate that a bow shock was being produced as the star plowed through a uniform medium, like a boat through water. Recent measurements and analyses, however, have shown the star is not moving quickly toward the bright edge. A more likely explanation has emerged that the material surrounding the star is not uniform, but clumped and denser near the bright edge.","asymmetric, nebula, surrounding, wolf-rayet, star, wr-18, shine, brighter, side, known, active, light-year, nautical, southern, constellation, carina, featured, deep, image, processed, bring, filamentary, detail, glowing, bubble-shaped, center, massive, short-lived, generates, intense, complex, stellar, wind, fact, create, interesting, shape, powerful, sweep, interstellar, material, case, bright, right, edge, thought, indicate, shock, produced, plowed, uniform, medium, boat, water, recent, measurement, analysis, shown, moving, likely, explanation, emerged, clumped, denser"
Total Lunar Eclipse,"The beginning, middle, and end of a journey through planet Earth's colorful umbral shadow is captured in this timelapse composite image of a total lunar eclipse. Taken on November 8 from Kitt Peak National Observatory this eclipse's 1 hour and 25 minute long total phase starts on the right and finishes on the left. Reddened sunlight, scattered into the central shadow by Earth's dusty atmosphere produces the dramatic dark red hues reflected by the lunar disk. For this eclipse, additional reddening is likely due to scattering from ash lingering in the atmosphere after a large volcanic eruption in the southern Pacific earlier this year. Seen at the right and left, the Earth's shadow is still lighter along its edge though. That faint bluish fringe along the lunar limb is colored by sunlight filtered through Earth's stratospheric ozone layer.   Lunar Eclipse of November 2022: Notable Submissions to APOD  Love Eclipses?

"Blood Moon, Ice Giant","On November 8 the Full Moon turned blood red as it slid through Earth's shadow in a beautiful total lunar eclipse. During totality it also passed in front of, or occulted, outer planet Uranus for eclipse viewers located in parts of northern America and Asia. For a close-up and wider view these two images were taken just before the occultation began, captured with different telescopes and cameras from the same roof top in Shanghai, China. Normally very faint compared to a Full Moon, the tiny, pale, greenish disk of the distant ice giant is just to the left of the Moon's edge and about to disappear behind the darkened, red lunar limb. Though only visible from certain locations across planet Earth, lunar occultations of planets are fairly common. But for this rare ""lunar eclipse occultation"" to take place, at the time of the total eclipse the outer planet had to be both at opposition and very near the ecliptic plane to fall in line with Sun, Earth, and Moon.

Eclipse in the City,"A darker Moon sets over Manhattan in this night skyscape. The 16 frame composite was assembled from consecutive exposures recorded during the November 8 total lunar eclipse. In the timelapse sequence stars leave short trails above the urban skyline, while the Moon remains immersed in Earth's shadow. But the International Space Station was just emerging from the shadow into the sunlit portion of its low Earth orbit. As seen from New York City, the visible streak of this ISS flyover starts near a star in Taurus and tracks right to left, through the belt of Orion and over Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major. Gaps along the bright trail of the fast moving orbital outpost (and an aircraft flying closer to the horizon) mark the time between individual exposures in the sequence. The trail of bright planet Mars is at the top of the frame. Pleiades star cluster trails are high over the eclipsed Moon and Empire State Building.

Flying Saucer Crash Lands in Utah Desert,"A flying saucer from outer space crash-landed in the Utah desert after being tracked by radar and chased by helicopters.  The year was 2004, and no space aliens were involved.  The saucer, pictured here, was the Genesis sample return capsule, part of a human-made robot Genesis spaceship launched in 2001 by NASA itself to study the Sun.  The unexpectedly hard landing at over 300 kilometers per hour occurred because the parachutes did not open as planned.  The Genesis mission had been orbiting the Sun collecting solar wind particles that are usually deflected away by Earth's magnetic field. Despite the crash landing, many return samples remained in good enough condition to analyze. So far, Genesis-related discoveries include new details about the composition of the Sun and how the abundance of some types of elements differ across the Solar System. These results have provided intriguing clues into details of how the Sun and planets formed billions of years ago.","flying, saucer, crash, land, utah, desert, outer, space, crash-landed, tracked, radar, chased, helicopter, year, alien, involved, pictured, genesis, sample, return, capsule, part, human-made, robot, spaceship, launched, nasa, study, hard, landing, kilometer, hour, occurred, parachute, open, planned, mission, orbiting, collecting, solar, wind, particle, deflected, earth, magnetic, field, many, remained, good, enough, condition, genesis-related, discovery, include, detail, composition, abundance, type, element, differ, system, result, provided, intriguing, clue, planet, formed"
NGC 7380: The Wizard Nebula,"What powers are being wielded in the Wizard Nebula?  Gravitation strong enough to form stars, and stellar winds and radiations powerful enough to create and dissolve towers of gas.  Located only 8,000 light years away, the Wizard nebula, featured here, surrounds developing open star cluster NGC 7380.  Visually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional medieval sorcerer.  The active star forming region spans 100 about light years, making it appear larger than the angular extent of the Moon.  The Wizard Nebula can be located with a small telescope toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia (Cepheus).  Although the nebula may last only a few million years, some of the stars being formed may outlive our Sun.","wizard, power, wielded, nebula, gravitation, strong, form, star, stellar, wind, radiation, powerful, create, dissolve, tower, located, light, year, featured, developing, open, cluster, interplay, dust, created, shape, appears, fictional, medieval, sorcerer, active, forming, region, span, making, appear, larger, angular, extent, moon, small, telescope, constellation, king, aethiopia, cepheus, last, formed, outlive"
Wolf's Cave Nebula,"The mysterious blue reflection nebula found in catalogs as VdB 152 or Ced 201 really is very faint. It lies at the tip of the long dark nebula Barnard 175 in a dusty complex that has also been called Wolf's Cave. At the center of this deep telescopic view, the cosmic apparitions are nearly 1,400 light-years away along the northern Milky Way in the royal constellation Cepheus. Interstellar dust in the region blocks light from background stars and scatters light from the embedded bright star, giving the end nebula its characteristic blue color. Though stars do form in molecular clouds, this star seems to have only accidentally wandered into the area, as its measured velocity through space is very different from the cloud's velocity. At the image bottom is the planetary nebula Dengel-Hartl 5, while red glowing gas from an ancient supernova remnant is also visible along the image's right side.","wolf, cave, mysterious, blue, reflection, nebula, found, catalog, faint, long, dark, barnard, dusty, complex, called, center, deep, telescopic, view, cosmic, apparition, light-year, northern, milky, royal, constellation, cepheus, interstellar, dust, region, block, light, background, star, scatter, embedded, bright, giving, characteristic, color, form, molecular, cloud, seems, wandered, area, measured, velocity, space, different, image, bottom, planetary, dengel-hartl, glowing, ancient, supernova, remnant, visible, right, side"
In the Arms of NGC 1097,"Spiral galaxy NGC 1097 shines in southern skies, about 45 million light-years away in the heated constellation Fornax. Its blue spiral arms are mottled with pinkish star forming regions in this colorful galaxy portrait. They seem to have wrapped around a small companion galaxy above and right of center, about 40,000 light-years from the spiral's luminous core. That's not NGC 1097's only peculiar feature, though. This very deep exposure hints of faint, mysterious jets, seen to extend well beyond the bluish arms. In fact, four faint jets are ultimately recognized in optical images of NGC 1097. The jets trace an X centered on the galaxy's nucleus, but probably don't originate there. Instead, they could be fossil star streams, trails left over from the capture and disruption of a much smaller galaxy in the large spiral's ancient past. A Seyfert galaxy, NGC 1097's nucleus also harbors a supermassive black hole.","spiral, galaxy, shine, southern, light-year, heated, constellation, fornax, blue, mottled, pinkish, star, forming, region, colorful, portrait, seem, wrapped, small, companion, center, luminous, core, peculiar, feature, deep, exposure, hint, faint, mysterious, seen, bluish, fact, recognized, optical, image, trace, centered, nucleus, originate, fossil, stream, trail, left, capture, disruption, smaller, large, ancient, past, seyfert, harbor, supermassive, black, hole"
Planet Earth from Orion,"A Space Launch System rocket left planet Earth on Wednesday, November 16 at 1:47am EST carrying the Orion spacecraft on the Artemis 1 mission, the first integrated test of NASA’s deep space exploration systems. Over an hour after liftoff from Kennedy Space Center's historic Launch Complex 39B, one of Orion's external video cameras captured this view of its new perspective from space. In the foreground are Orion's Orbital Maneuvering System engine and auxillary engines, at the bottom of the European Service Module. Beyond one of the module's 7-meter long extended solar array wings lies the spacecraft's beautiful home world. The Artemis 1 mission will last almost four weeks, testing capabilities to enable human exploration of the Moon and Mars. The uncrewed Orion spacecraft is expected to fly by the Moon on November 21, performing a close approach to the lunar surface on its way to a retrograde orbit 70,000 kilometers beyond the Moon.  ","planet, earth, orion, space, launch, system, rocket, left, wednesday, carrying, spacecraft, artemis, mission, integrated, test, nasa, deep, exploration, hour, liftoff, kennedy, center, historic, complex, external, video, camera, captured, view, perspective, foreground, orbital, maneuvering, engine, auxillary, bottom, european, service, module, 7-meter, extended, solar, array, wing, beautiful, home, world, last, week, testing, capability, enable, human, moon, uncrewed, expected, performing, close, approach, lunar, surface, retrograde, kilometer"
The Protostar within L1527,"The protostar within dark cloud L1527 is a mere 100,000 years old, still embedded in the cloud of gas and dust that feeds its growth. In this NIRCam image from the James Webb Space Telescope, the dark band at the neck of the infrared nebula is a thick disk that surrounds the young stellar object.  Viewed nearly edge-on and a little larger than our Solar System, the disk ultimately supplies material to the protostar while hiding it from Webb's direct infrared view. The nebula itself is seen in stunning detail though. Illuminated by infrared light from the protostar, the hourglass-shaped nebula's cavities are created as material ejected in the star-forming process plows through the surrounding medium. As the protostar gains mass it will eventually become a full-fledged star, collapsing and igniting nuclear fusion in its core. A likely analog to our own Sun and Solar System in their early infancy, the protostar within dark cloud L1527 lies some 460 light-years distant in the Taurus star-forming region.

Artemis 1 Moonshot,"When the Artemis 1 mission's Orion spacecraft makes its November 21 powered flyby of the Moon, denizens of planet Earth will see the Moon in a waning crescent phase. The spacecraft will approach to within about 130 kilometers of the lunar surface on its way to a distant retrograde orbit some 70,000 kilometers beyond the Moon. But the Moon was at last quarter for the November 16 launch and near the horizon in the dark early hours after midnight. It's captured here in skies over Kennedy Space Center along with the SLS rocket engines and solid rocket boosters lofting the uncrewed Orion to space. Ragged fringes appearing along the bright edge of the sunlit lunar nearside are caused as pressure waves generated by the rocket's passage change the index of refraction along the camera's line of sight.","moonshot, mission, orion, spacecraft, make, november, powered, flyby, moon, denizen, planet, earth, waning, crescent, phase, approach, kilometer, lunar, surface, distant, retrograde, orbit, last, quarter, launch, horizon, dark, early, hour, midnight, captured, kennedy, space, center, rocket, engine, solid, booster, lofting, uncrewed, ragged, fringe, appearing, bright, edge, sunlit, caused, pressure, wave, generated, passage, change, index, refraction, camera, line, sight"
Airglow Ripples over Tibet,"Why would the sky look like a giant target? Airglow. Following a giant thunderstorm over Bangladesh in late April, giant circular ripples of glowing air appeared over Tibet, China, as pictured here. The unusual pattern is created by atmospheric gravity waves, waves of alternating air pressure that can grow with height as the air thins, in this case about 90-kilometers up.  Unlike auroras powered by collisions with energetic charged particles and seen at high latitudes, airglow is due to chemiluminescence, the production of light in a chemical reaction.  More typically seen near the horizon, airglow keeps the night sky from ever being completely dark.","airglow, ripple, tibet, look, giant, target, following, thunderstorm, bangladesh, late, april, circular, glowing, appeared, china, pictured, unusual, pattern, created, atmospheric, gravity, wave, alternating, pressure, grow, height, thins, case, 90-kilometers, aurora, powered, collision, energetic, charged, particle, seen, high, latitude, chemiluminescence, production, light, chemical, reaction, horizon, keep, night, dark"
The Butterfly Nebula from Hubble,"Stars can make beautiful patterns as they age -- sometimes similar to flowers or insects. NGC 6302, the Butterfly Nebula, is a notable example.  Though its gaseous wingspan covers over 3 light-years and its estimated surface temperature exceeds 200,000 degrees C, the aging central star of NGC 6302, the featured planetary nebula, has become exceptionally hot, shining brightly in visible and ultraviolet light but hidden from direct view by a dense torus of dust. This sharp close-up was recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope and is processed here to show off remarkable details of the complex planetary nebula, highlighting in particular light emitted by oxygen (shown as blue), hydrogen (green), and nitrogen (red). NGC 6302 lies about 3,500 light-years away in the arachnologically correct constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius). Planetary nebulas evolve from outer atmospheres of stars like our Sun, but usually fade in about 20,000 years.","butterfly, hubble, star, make, beautiful, pattern, similar, flower, insect, notable, example, gaseous, wingspan, cover, light-year, estimated, surface, temperature, exceeds, degree, aging, central, featured, planetary, nebula, become, shining, visible, ultraviolet, light, hidden, direct, view, dense, torus, dust, sharp, close-up, recorded, space, telescope, processed, show, remarkable, detail, complex, highlighting, particular, emitted, oxygen, shown, blue, hydrogen, green, nitrogen, correct, constellation, scorpion, scorpius, evolve, outer, fade, year"
A Double Star Cluster in Perseus,"Few star clusters are this close to each other.  Visible to the unaided eye from dark sky areas, it was cataloged in 130 BC by Greek astronomer Hipparchus.  Some 7,000 light-years away, this pair of open star clusters is also an easy binocular target, a striking starfield in the northern constellation of the mythical Greek hero Perseus. Now known as h and chi Persei, or NGC 869 (above right) and NGC 884, the clusters themselves are separated by only a few hundred light-years and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  In addition to being physically close together, the clusters' ages based on their individual stars are similar - evidence that both clusters were likely a product of the same star-forming region.","double, star, cluster, perseus, visible, unaided, dark, area, cataloged, greek, astronomer, hipparchus, light-year, pair, open, easy, binocular, target, striking, starfield, northern, constellation, mythical, hero, known, persei, right, separated, contain, younger, hotter, addition, based, individual, similar, evidence, likely, product, star-forming, region"
Earthset from Orion,"ght billion people are about to disappear in this snapshot from space. Taken on November 21, the sixth day of the Artemis 1 mission, their home world is setting behind the Moon's bright edge as viewed by an external camera on the outbound Orion spacecraft. The Orion was headed for a powered flyby that took it to within 130 kilometers of the lunar surface. Velocity gained in the flyby maneuver will be used to reach a distant retrograde orbit around the Moon. That orbit is considered distant because it's another 92,000 kilometers beyond the Moon, and retrograde because the spacecraft will orbit in the opposite direction of the Moon's orbit around planet Earth. Orion will enter its distant retrograde orbit on Friday, November 25. Swinging around the Moon, Orion will reach a maximum distance (just over 400,000 kilometers) from Earth on Monday November 28 exceeding a record set by Apollo 13 for most distant spacecraft designed for human space exploration.","earthset, orion, people, disappear, snapshot, space, taken, sixth, artemis, mission, home, world, setting, moon, bright, edge, viewed, external, camera, spacecraft, headed, powered, flyby, took, kilometer, lunar, surface, velocity, gained, maneuver, used, reach, distant, retrograde, orbit, considered, opposite, direction, planet, earth, enter, friday, swinging, maximum, distance, monday, exceeding, record, designed, human, exploration"
Lynds Dark Nebula 1251,"Stars are forming in Lynds Dark Nebula (LDN) 1251. About 1,000 light-years away and drifting above the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, the dusty molecular cloud is part of a complex of dark nebulae mapped toward the Cepheus flare region. Across the spectrum, astronomical explorations of the obscuring interstellar clouds reveal energetic shocks and outflows associated with newborn stars, including the telltale reddish glow from scattered Herbig-Haro objects hiding in the image. Distant background galaxies also lurk on the scene, almost buried behind the dusty expanse. This alluring view spans over four full moons on the sky, or 35 light-years at the estimated distance of LDN 1251.","lynds, dark, nebula, star, forming, light-year, drifting, plane, milky, galaxy, dusty, molecular, cloud, part, complex, mapped, cepheus, flare, region, spectrum, astronomical, exploration, obscuring, interstellar, reveal, energetic, shock, outflow, associated, newborn, including, telltale, reddish, glow, scattered, herbig-haro, object, hiding, image, distant, background, lurk, scene, buried, expanse, alluring, view, span, full, moon, estimated, distance"
NGC 6744: Extragalactic Close-Up,"Beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 6744 is nearly 175,000 light-years across. That's larger than the Milky Way. It lies some 30 million light-years distant in the southern constellation Pavo, with its galactic disk tilted towards our line of sight. This Hubble close-up of the nearby island universe spans about 24,000 light-years or so across NGC 6744's central region. The Hubble view combines visible light and ultraviolet image data. The giant galaxy's yellowish core is dominated by the visible light from old, cool stars. Beyond the core are star-forming regions and young star clusters scattered along the inner spiral arms. NGC 6744's young star clusters are bright at ultraviolet wavelengths, shown in blue and magenta hues. Spiky stars scattered around the frame are foreground stars and well within our own Milky Way.","extragalactic, close-up, beautiful, spiral, galaxy, light-year, across, larger, milky, distant, southern, constellation, pavo, galactic, disk, tilted, towards, line, sight, hubble, nearby, island, universe, span, central, region, view, combine, visible, light, ultraviolet, image, data, giant, yellowish, core, dominated, cool, star, star-forming, young, cluster, scattered, inner, bright, wavelength, shown, blue, magenta, spiky, frame, foreground"
Saturn at Night,"Saturn is still bright in planet Earth's night skies. Telescopic views of the distant gas giant and its beautiful rings often make it a star at star parties. But this stunning view of Saturn's rings and night side just isn't possible from telescopes closer to the Sun than the outer planet. They can only bring Saturn's day into view. In fact, this image of Saturn's slender sunlit crescent with night's shadow cast across its broad and complex ring system was captured by the Cassini spacecraft. A robot spacecraft from planet Earth, Cassini called Saturn orbit home for 13 years before it was directed to dive into the atmosphere of the gas giant on September 15, 2017. This magnificent mosaic is composed of frames recorded by Cassini's wide-angle camera only two days before its grand final plunge. Saturn's night will not be seen again until another spaceship from Earth calls.","saturn, night, bright, planet, earth, telescopic, view, distant, giant, beautiful, ring, make, star, party, stunning, side, possible, telescope, closer, outer, bring, fact, image, slender, sunlit, crescent, shadow, cast, broad, complex, system, captured, cassini, spacecraft, robot, called, orbit, home, year, directed, dive, atmosphere, september, magnificent, mosaic, composed, frame, recorded, wide-angle, camera, grand, final, plunge, seen, spaceship, call"
Supernumerary Rainbows over New Jersey,"Yes, but can your rainbow do this?  After the remnants of Hurricane Florence passed over the Jersey Shore, New Jersey, USA in 2018, the Sun came out in one direction but something quite unusual appeared in the opposite direction: a hall of rainbows.  Over the course of a next half hour, to the delight of the photographer and his daughter, vibrant supernumerary rainbows faded in and out, with at least five captured in this featured single shot.  Supernumerary rainbows only form when falling water droplets are all nearly the same size and typically less than a millimeter across.  Then, sunlight will not only reflect from inside the raindrops, but interfere, a wave phenomenon similar to ripples on a pond when a stone is thrown in. In fact, supernumerary rainbows can only be explained with waves, and their noted existence in the early 1800s was considered early evidence of light's wave nature.

Leonid Meteors Through Orion,"Where will the next meteor appear? Even during a meteor shower, it is practically impossible to know. Therefore, a good way to enjoy a meteor shower is to find a place where you can sit comfortably and monitor a great expanse of dark sky. And it may be satisfying to share this experience with a friend.  The meteor shower depicted was the 2022 Leonids which peaked earlier this month, and the view is from Hainan, China looking out over the South China Sea. Meteor streaks captured over a few hours were isolated and added to a foreground image recorded earlier.  From this place and time, Leonid meteors that trace back to the constellation of Leo were seen streaking across other constellations including Orion. The bright red planet Mars appears near the top of the image. Bonding over their love of astronomy, the two pictured meteor enthusiasts, shown celebrating their common birthday this month, are now married.","leonid, meteor, orion, appear, shower, impossible, know, good, enjoy, find, place, monitor, great, expanse, dark, satisfying, share, experience, friend, depicted, leonids, peaked, month, view, hainan, china, looking, south, streak, captured, hour, isolated, added, foreground, image, recorded, time, trace, constellation, seen, streaking, including, planet, appears, bonding, love, astronomy, pictured, shown, celebrating, common, birthday, married"
The Gum Nebula Supernova Remnant,"Because the Gum Nebula is the closest supernova remnant, it is actually hard to see.  Spanning 40 degrees across the sky, the nebula appears so large and faint that it is easily lost in the din of a bright and complex background.  The Gum Nebula is highlighted nicely in red emission toward the right of the featured wide-angle, single-image photograph taken in late May. Also visible in the frame are the Atacama Desert in Chile in the foreground, the Carina Nebula in the plane of our Milky Way galaxy running diagonally down from the upper left, and the neighboring Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC) galaxy. The Gum Nebula is so close that we are much nearer the front edge than the back edge, each measuring 450 and 1500 light years respectively.  The complicated nebula lies in the direction of the constellations of Puppis and Vela.  Oddly, much remains unknown about the Gum Nebula, including the timing and even number of supernova explosions that formed it.","nebula, supernova, remnant, closest, hard, spanning, degree, appears, large, faint, lost, bright, complex, background, highlighted, emission, right, featured, wide-angle, single-image, photograph, taken, late, visible, frame, atacama, desert, chile, foreground, carina, plane, milky, galaxy, running, upper, left, neighboring, magellanic, cloud, much, nearer, front, edge, measuring, light, year, complicated, direction, constellation, puppis, vela, remains, unknown, including, timing, number, explosion, formed"
"The Light, the Dark, and the Dusty","This colorful skyscape spans about four full moons across nebula rich starfields along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy in the royal northern constellation Cepheus. Near the edge of the region's massive molecular cloud some 2,400 light-years away, bright reddish emission region Sharpless (Sh) 155 is at the center of the frame, also known as the Cave Nebula. About 10 light-years across the cosmic cave's bright walls of gas are ionized by ultraviolet light from the hot young stars around it. Dusty reflection nebulae, like vdB 155 to the right, and dense obscuring clouds of dust also abound on the interstellar canvas. Astronomical explorations have revealed other dramatic signs of star formation, including the bright reddish fleck of Herbig-Haro (HH) 168.

Artemis 1: Flight Day 13,"On flight day 13 (November 28) of the Artemis 1 mission the Orion spacecraft reached its maximum distance from Earth. In fact, over 430,000 kilometers from Earth its distant retrograde orbit also put Orion nearly 70,000 kilometers from the Moon. In the same field of view in this video frame from flight day 13, planet and large natural satellite even appear about the same apparent size from the uncrewed spacecraft's perspective. Today (December 1) should see Orion depart its distant retrograde orbit. En route to planet Earth it will head toward a second powered fly by of the Moon.

The cosmic mashup is seen against a background of even more distant galaxies, and occasional spiky foreground stars. But the galaxy merger itself spans about 100,000 light-years in this deep James Webb Space Telescope image.

Stereo Mars near Opposition,"Mars looks sharp in these two rooftop telescope views captured in late November from Singapore, planet Earth. At the time, Mars was about 82 million kilometers from Singapore and approaching its opposition, opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky on December 8. Olympus Mons, largest of the volcanoes in the Tharsis Montes region (and largest known volcano in the Solar System), is near Mars' western limb. In both images it's the whitish donut-shape at the upper right. The dark area visible near center is the Terra Sirenum region while the long dark peninsula closest to the planet's eastern limb is Sinus Gomer. Near its tip is Gale crater, the Curiosity rover's landing site in 2012. Above Sinus Gomer, white spots are other volcanoes in the Elysium region. At the top of the planet is the north polar cap covered with ice and clouds. Taken about two days apart, these images of the same martian hemisphere form a stereo pair.

Video: Powers of Ten,"How different does the universe look on very small scales?  On very large scales? The most famous short science film of its generation gives breathtaking comparisons. That film, Powers of Ten, originally created in the 1960s, has been officially posted to YouTube and embedded here.  From a picnic blanket near Chicago out past the Virgo Cluster of Galaxies, every ten seconds the film zooms out to show a square a factor of ten times larger on each side. The 9-minute video then reverses, zooming back in a factor of ten every two seconds and ends up inside a single proton. The Powers of Ten sequence is actually based on the book Cosmic View by Kees Boeke in 1957, as is a similar but mostly animated film Cosmic Zoom that was also created in the late 1960s. The changing perspectives are so enthralling and educational that sections have been recreated using more modern computerized techniques, including the first few minutes of the movie Contact. Ray and husband Charles Eames, the film's creators, were known as quite visionary spirits and even invented their own popular chair.","video, power, different, universe, look, small, scale, large, famous, short, science, film, generation, give, breathtaking, comparison, created, posted, youtube, embedded, picnic, blanket, chicago, virgo, cluster, galaxy, second, zoom, show, square, factor, time, larger, side, revers, zooming, single, proton, sequence, based, book, cosmic, view, kees, similar, animated, late, 1960s, changing, perspective, enthralling, educational, section, recreated, using, modern, computerized, technique, including, first, minute, movie, contact, husband, charles, eames, creator, known, visionary, spirit, invented, popular, chair"
Pleiades: The Seven Sisters Star Cluster,"Have you ever seen the Pleiades star cluster? Even if you have, you probably have never seen it as large and clear as this. Perhaps the most famous star cluster on the sky, the bright stars of the Pleiades can be seen with the unaided eye even from the depths of a light-polluted city.  With a long exposure from a dark location, though, the dust cloud surrounding the Pleiades star cluster becomes very evident. The featured 11-hour exposure, taken from the Siding Spring Observatory in Australia, covers a sky area several times the size of the full moon.  Also known as the Seven Sisters and M45, the Pleiades lies about 400 light years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).  A common legend with a modern twist is that one of the brighter stars faded since the cluster was named, leaving only six of the sister stars visible to the unaided eye. The actual number of Pleiades stars visible, however, may be more or less than seven, depending on the darkness of the surrounding sky and the clarity of the observer's eyesight.

M16: A Star Forming Pillar from Webb,"What’s happening inside this interstellar mountain? Stars are forming. The mountain is actually a column of gas and dust in the picturesque Eagle Nebula (M16).  A pillar like this is so low in density that you could easily fly though it -- it only appears solid because of its high dust content and great depth. The glowing areas are lit internally by newly formed stars. These areas shine in red and infrared light because blue light is scattered away by intervening interstellar dust. The featured image was captured recently in near-infrared light in unprecedented detail by the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST), launched late last year. Energetic light, abrasive winds, and final supernovas from these young stars will slowly destroy this stellar birth column over the next 100,000 years.

NGC 7293: The Helix Nebula,"A mere seven hundred light years from Earth, toward the constellation Aquarius, a sun-like star is dying. The dying star's last few thousand years have produced the Helix Nebula (NGC 7293), a well studied and nearby example of a Planetary Nebula, typical of this final phase of stellar evolution.  Combining narrow band image data from emission lines of hydrogen atoms in red and oxygen atoms in blue-green hues, it shows tantalizing details of the Helix, including its bright inner region about 3 light-years across. The white dot at the Helix's center is this Planetary Nebula's hot, central star.

Prominent on the lunar nearside Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms, is the largest of the Moon's lava-flooded maria. The lunar terminator, shadow line between lunar night and day, runs along the left of the frame. The 41 kilometer diameter crater Marius is top center, with ray crater Kepler peeking in at the edge, just right of the solar array wing.

Mars Rises above the Lunar Limb,"On the night of December 7 Mars wandered near the Full Moon. In fact the Red Planet was occulted, passing behind the Moon, when viewed from locations across Europe and North America. About an hour after disappearing behind the lunar disk Mars reappears in this stack of sharp video frames captured from San Diego, planet Earth. With the Moon in the foreground Mars was a mere 82 million kilometers distant, near its own opposition. Full Moon and full Mars were bright enough to provide the spectacular image with no exposure adjustments necessary.

Io in True Color,"The strangest moon in the Solar System is bright yellow.  The featured picture, an attempt to show how Io would appear in the ""true colors"" perceptible to the average human eye, was taken in 1999 July by the Galileo spacecraft that orbited Jupiter from 1995 to 2003.  Io's colors derive from sulfur and molten silicate rock.  The unusual surface of Io is kept very young by its system of active volcanoes.  The intense tidal gravity of Jupiter stretches Io and damps wobbles caused by Jupiter's other Galilean moons.  The resulting friction greatly heats Io's interior, causing  molten rock to explode through the surface.  Io's volcanoes are so active that they are effectively turning the whole moon inside out.  Some of Io's volcanic lava is so hot it glows in the dark.

An Unusual Globule in IC 1396,"Is there a monster in IC 1396?  Known to some as the Elephant's Trunk Nebula, parts of gas and dust clouds of this star formation region may appear to take on foreboding forms, some nearly human.  The only real monster here, however, is a bright young star too far from Earth to hurt us.  Energetic light from this star is eating away the dust of the dark cometary globule near the top of the featured image.  Jets and winds of particles emitted from this star are also pushing away ambient gas and dust.  Nearly 3,000 light-years distant, the relatively faint IC 1396 complex covers a much larger region on the sky than shown here, with an apparent width of more than 10 full moons.","unusual, globule, monster, known, elephant, trunk, part, dust, cloud, star, formation, region, appear, take, foreboding, form, human, real, bright, young, earth, hurt, energetic, light, eating, dark, cometary, featured, image, particle, emitted, pushing, ambient, light-year, distant, faint, complex, larger, shown, apparent, width, full, moon"

Lunar Dust and Duct Tape,"Why is the Moon so dusty? On Earth, rocks are weathered by wind and water, creating soil and sand. On the Moon, the history of constant micrometeorite bombardment has blasted away at the rocky surface creating a layer of powdery lunar soil or regolith.  For the Apollo astronauts and their equipment, the pervasive, fine, gritty dust was definitely a problem. Fifty years ago, on the lunar surface in December 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Harrison Schmitt and Eugene Cernan needed to repair one of their rover's fenders in an effort to keep the rooster tails of dust away from themselves and their gear. This picture reveals the wheel and fender of their dust covered rover along with the ingenious application of spare maps, clamps, and a grey strip of ""duct tape"".","lunar, dust, duct, tape, moon, dusty, earth, rock, weathered, wind, water, creating, soil, sand, history, constant, micrometeorite, bombardment, blasted, rocky, surface, layer, powdery, regolith, apollo, astronaut, equipment, pervasive, fine, gritty, problem, fifty, year, december, harrison, schmitt, eugene, cernan, needed, repair, rover, fender, effort, keep, rooster, tail, gear, picture, reveals, wheel, covered, ingenious, application, spare, clamp, grey, strip"
"Full Moon, Full Mars","On December 8 a full Moon and a full Mars were close, both bright and opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky. In fact Mars was occulted, passing behind the Moon when viewed from some locations across Europe and North America.  Seen from the city of Kosice in eastern Slovakia, the lunar occultation of Mars happened just before sunrise. The tantalizing spectacle was recorded in this telescopic timelapse sequence of exposures. It took about an hour for the Red Planet to disappear behind the lunar disk and then reappear as a warm-hued full Moon, the last full Moon of 2022, sank toward the western horizon. The next lunar occultation of bright planet Mars will be in the new year on January 3, when the Moon is in a waxing gibbous phase. Lunar occultations are only ever visible from a fraction of the Earth's surface, though. The January 3 occultation of Mars will be visible from parts of the South Atlantic, southern Africa, and the Indian Ocean.","full, moon, december, bright, opposite, planet, earth, fact, occulted, passing, viewed, location, europe, north, america, seen, city, kosice, eastern, slovakia, lunar, occultation, happened, sunrise, tantalizing, spectacle, recorded, telescopic, timelapse, sequence, exposure, took, hour, disappear, disk, reappear, warm-hued, last, sank, western, horizon, year, january, waxing, gibbous, phase, visible, fraction, surface, part, south, atlantic, southern, africa, indian, ocean"
The Geminid,"Returning from beyond the Moon, on December 11 the Orion spacecraft entered Earth's atmosphere at almost 11 kilometers per second. That's half the speed of the grain of dust that created this long fireball meteor when it entered the atmosphere on December 13, near the peak of the annual Geminid meteor shower. As our fair planet makes its yearly pass through the dust trail of mysterious asteroid 3200 Phaethon, the parallel tracks of all Geminid meteors appear to radiate from a point in the constellation Gemini. But the twin stars of Gemini hide just behind the trees on the left in this night skyscape from the beautiful Blue Moon Valley, Yunnan, China. Reflected in the still waters of the mountain lake, stars of the constellation Orion are rising near center. Captured before moonrise, dazzling Mars is still the brightest celestial beacon in the scene.","geminid, returning, moon, december, orion, spacecraft, entered, earth, atmosphere, kilometer, second, half, speed, grain, dust, created, fireball, meteor, peak, annual, shower, fair, planet, make, yearly, trail, mysterious, asteroid, phaethon, parallel, track, appear, radiate, point, constellation, gemini, twin, star, hide, tree, left, night, skyscape, beautiful, blue, valley, yunnan, china, reflected, water, mountain, lake, rising, center, captured, moonrise, dazzling, brightest, celestial, beacon, scene"
Apollo 17 VIP Site Anaglyph,"Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this stereo scene from Taurus-Littrow valley on the Moon! The color anaglyph features a detailed 3D view of Apollo 17's Lunar Rover in the foreground -- behind it lies the Lunar Module and distant lunar hills. Because the world was going to be able to watch the Lunar Module's ascent stage liftoff via the rover's TV camera, this parking place was also known as the VIP Site. Fifty years ago, in December of 1972, Apollo 17 astronauts Eugene Cernan and Harrison Schmitt spent about 75 hours on the Moon, while colleague Ronald Evans orbited overhead. The crew returned with 110 kilograms of rock and soil samples, more than from any of the other lunar landing sites.

25 Brightest Stars in the Night Sky,"Do you know the names of some of the brightest stars? It's likely that you do, even though some bright stars have names so old they date back to near the beginning of written language. Many world cultures have their own names for the brightest stars, and it is culturally and historically important to remember them.  In the interest of clear global communication, however, the International Astronomical Union (IAU) has begun to designate standardized star names.  Featured here in true color are the 25 brightest stars in the night sky, currently as seen by humans, coupled with their IAU-recognized names. Some star names have interesting meanings, including Sirius (""the scorcher"" in Latin), Vega (""falling"" in Arabic), and Antares (""rival to Mars"" in Greek). You are likely even familiar with the name of at least one star too dim to make this list: Polaris.

The Tadpole Nebula in Gas and Dust,"What's causing the commotion in the Tadpole Nebula? Star formation.  Dusty emission in the Tadpole Nebula, IC 410, lies about 12,000 light-years away in the northern constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga). The cloud of glowing gas is over 100 light-years across, sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from embedded open star cluster NGC 1893. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, bright newly formed cluster stars are seen all around the star-forming nebula.  Notable on the lower-right of the featured image are two relatively dense streamers of material trailing away from the nebula's central regions. Potentially sites of ongoing star formation in IC 410, these cosmic tadpole shapes are about 10 light-years long.

Thor's Helmet,"Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor's Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown with a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This remarkably sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula's filamentary structures.

Sun Halo at Sixty-three Degrees North,"Happy Solstice! Today is the December solstice, marking an astronomical beginning of summer in the southern hemisphere and winter in the north. On its yearly trek through planet Earth's skies, at this solstice the Sun reaches its southern most declination, 23.5 degrees south, at 21:48 UTC. About 4 days ago the Sun was near this seasonal southern limit and so only just above the horizon at local noon from Ostersund in central Sweden. This view looking over the far northern lakeside city finds the midday Sun with a beautiful solar ice halo. Naturally occurring atmospheric ice crystals can produce the tantalizing halo displays, refracting and reflecting the sunlight through their hexagonal geometry.  Still, with the Sun low and near the horizon in the clear sky, likely sources of the ice crystals producing this intense halo are snow cannons. Operating at a local ski area, the snowmaking machines create a visible plume at the top of the nearby island Froson toward the right side of the panorama.","halo, sixty-three, degree, north, happy, solstice, today, december, marking, astronomical, beginning, summer, southern, winter, trek, planet, earth, reach, declination, seasonal, limit, horizon, local, noon, central, sweden, view, looking, northern, lakeside, city, find, midday, beautiful, solar, occurring, atmospheric, crystal, produce, tantalizing, display, refracting, reflecting, sunlight, hexagonal, geometry, clear, likely, source, producing, intense, snow, cannon, operating, area, snowmaking, machine, create, visible, plume, nearby, island, froson, right, side, panorama"
NGC 1365: Majestic Island Universe,"Barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 is truly a majestic island universe some 200,000 light-years across. Located a mere 60 million light-years away toward the faint but heated constellation Fornax, NGC 1365 is a dominant member of the well-studied Fornax Cluster of galaxies. This impressively sharp color image shows the intense, reddish star forming regions near the ends of the galaxy's central bar and along its spiral arms. Seen in fine detail, obscuring dust lanes cut across the galaxy's bright core. At the core lies a supermassive black hole. Astronomers think NGC 1365's prominent bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, drawing gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the central black hole.","majestic, island, universe, barred, spiral, galaxy, light-year, located, faint, heated, constellation, fornax, dominant, member, well-studied, cluster, sharp, color, image, show, intense, reddish, star, forming, region, central, seen, fine, detail, obscuring, dust, lane, bright, core, supermassive, black, hole, astronomer, think, prominent, play, crucial, role, evolution, drawing, star-forming, maelstrom, feeding, material"
Cassini Looks Out from Saturn,"This is what Saturn looks like from inside the rings. In 2017, for the first time, NASA directed the Cassini spacecraft to swoop between Saturn and its rings. During the dive, the robotic spacecraft took hundreds of images showing unprecedented detail for structures in Saturn's atmosphere. Looking back out, however, the spacecraft was also able to capture impressive vistas. In the featured image, taken a few hours before closest approach, Saturn's unusual northern hexagon is seen surrounding the North Pole. Saturn's B ring is the closest visible, while the dark Cassini Division separates B from the outer A.  A close inspection will find the two small moons that shepherd the F-ring, the farthest ring discernable.  A few months after this image was taken -- and after more than a decade of exploration and discovery -- the Cassini spacecraft ran low on fuel and was directed to enter Saturn's atmosphere, where it surely melted.","cassini, look, saturn, ring, first, time, directed, spacecraft, swoop, dive, robotic, took, hundred, image, showing, unprecedented, detail, structure, atmosphere, looking, able, capture, impressive, vista, featured, taken, hour, closest, approach, unusual, northern, hexagon, seen, surrounding, north, pole, visible, dark, division, separate, outer, close, inspection, find, small, moon, shepherd, f-ring, farthest, discernable, month, decade, exploration, discovery, fuel, melted"
Comet 2022 E3 (ZTF),"Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) was discovered by astronomers using the wide-field survey camera at the Zwicky Transient Facility this year in early March. Since then the new long-period comet has brightened substantially and is now sweeping across the northern constellation Corona Borealis in predawn skies. It's still too dim to see without a telescope though. But this fine telescopic image from December 19 does show the comet's brighter greenish coma, short broad dust tail, and long faint ion tail stretching across a 2.5 degree wide field-of-view. On a voyage through the inner Solar System comet 2022 E3 will be at perihelion, its closest to the Sun, in the new year on January 12 and at perigee, its closest to our fair planet, on February 1. The brightness of comets is notoriously unpredictable, but by then C/2022 E3 (ZTF) could become only just visible to the eye in dark night skies.","comet, c/2022, discovered, using, wide-field, survey, camera, zwicky, transient, facility, year, march, long-period, brightened, sweeping, northern, constellation, corona, borealis, predawn, telescope, fine, telescopic, image, december, show, brighter, greenish, coma, short, broad, dust, tail, faint, stretching, degree, wide, field-of-view, voyage, inner, solar, system, perihelion, closest, january, perigee, fair, planet, february, brightness, unpredictable, become, visible, dark, night"
Geminids and the Mittens,"Asteroid 3200 Phaethon's annual gift to planet Earth always arrives in December. Otherwise known as the Geminid meteor shower, the source of the meteroid stream is dust shed along the orbit of the mysterious asteroid. Near the December 13/14 peak of the shower's activity, geminid meteors are captured in this night skyscape, composited from 22 images of starry sky taken before the moon rose over Monument Valley in the American southwest. The bright stars near the position of the shower's radiant are the constellation Gemini's twin stars Castor (blue) and Pollux (yellow). As Earth sweeps through the dusty stream, the parallel meteor trails appear to radiate from a point on the sky in Gemini due to perspective, and so the yearly shower is named for the constellation. From the camera's perspective, this view of three prominent buttes across Monument Valley also suggests appropriate names for two of them. The third one is called Merrick Butte.","geminids, mitten, asteroid, phaethon, annual, gift, planet, earth, arrives, december, known, geminid, meteor, shower, source, meteroid, stream, dust, shed, mysterious, peak, activity, captured, night, skyscape, composited, image, starry, taken, moon, rose, monument, valley, american, southwest, bright, star, position, radiant, constellation, gemini, twin, castor, blue, yellow, sweep, dusty, trail, appear, radiate, point, named, camera, perspective, view, prominent, butte, suggests, appropriate, name, third, called, merrick"
NGC 6164: Dragon's Egg Nebula and Halo,"The star at the center created everything.  Known as the Dragon's Egg, this star -- a rare, hot, luminous O-type star some 40 times as massive as the Sun -- created not only the complex nebula (NGC 6164) that immediately surrounds it, but also the encompassing blue halo. Its name is derived, in part, from the region's proximity to the picturesque NGC 6188, known as the fighting Dragons of Ara. In another three to four million years the massive star will likely end its life in a supernova explosion. Spanning around 4 light-years, the nebula itself has a bipolar symmetry making it similar in appearance to more common planetary nebulae - the gaseous shrouds surrounding dying sun-like stars. Also like many planetary nebulae, NGC 6164 has been found to have an extensive, faint halo, revealed in blue in this deep telescopic image of the region. Expanding into the surrounding interstellar medium, the material in the blue halo was likely expelled from an earlier active phase of the O-star.

A Full Circle Rainbow over Norway,"Have you ever seen an entire rainbow? From the ground, typically, only the top portion of a rainbow is visible because directions toward the ground have fewer raindrops. From the air, though, the entire 360-degree circle of a rainbow is more commonly visible. Pictured here, a full-circle rainbow was captured over the Lofoten Islands of Norway in September by a drone passing through a rain shower. An observer-dependent phenomenon primarily caused by the internal reflection of sunlight by raindrops, the rainbow has a full diameter of 84 degrees. The Sun is in the exact opposite direction from the rainbow's center.  As a bonus, a second rainbow that was more faint and color-reversed was visible outside the first.","full, circle, rainbow, seen, entire, ground, portion, visible, direction, fewer, raindrop, 360-degree, pictured, full-circle, captured, lofoten, island, september, drone, passing, rain, shower, observer-dependent, phenomenon, caused, internal, reflection, sunlight, diameter, degree, exact, opposite, center, bonus, second, faint, color-reversed, first"
Messier 88,"Charles Messier described the 88th entry in his 18th century catalog of Nebulae and Star Clusters as a nebula without stars. Of course the gorgeous M88 is now understood to be a spiral galaxy full of stars, gas, and dust, not unlike our own Milky Way. In fact, M88 is one of the brightest galaxies in the Virgo Galaxy Cluster some 50 million light-years away. M88's beautiful spiral arms are easy to trace in this sharp cosmic portait.  The arms are lined with young blue star clusters, pink star-forming regions, and obscuring dust lanes extending from a yellowish core dominated by an older population of stars.

Horsehead and Flame,"The Horsehead Nebula, famous celestial dark marking also known as Barnard 33, is notched against a background glow of emission nebulae in this sharp cosmic skyscape. About five light-years ""tall"" the Horsehead lies some 1,500 light-years away in the constellation of Orion. Within the region's fertile molecular cloud complex, the expanse of obscuring dust has a recognizable shape only by chance from our perspective in the Milky Way though. Orion's easternmost belt star, bright Alnitak, is to the left of center.  Energetic ultraviolet light from Alnitak powers the glow of dusty NGC 2024, the Flame Nebula, just below it. Completing a study in cosmic contrasts, bluish reflection nebula NGC 2023 is below the Horsehead itself.

Mars and the Star Clusters,"At this year's end Mars still shines brightly in planet Earth's night as it wanders through the head-strong constellation Taurus. Its bright yellowish hue dominates this starry field of view that includes Taurus' alpha star Aldebaran and the Hyades and Pleiades star clusters. While red giant Aldebaran appears to anchor the V-shape of the Hyades at the left of the frame, Aldebaran is not a member of the Hyades star cluster. The Hyades cluster is 151 light-years away making it the nearest established open star cluster, but Aldebaran lies at less than half that distance, along the same line-of-sight.  At the right, some 400 light-years distant is the open star cluster cataloged as Messier 45, also known as the Pleiades or Seven Sisters.

Moon over Makemake,"Makemake (sounds like MAH-kay MAH-kay), second brightest dwarf planet of the Kuiper belt, has a moon. Nicknamed MK2, Makemake's moon reflects sunlight with a charcoal-dark surface, about 1,300 times fainter than its parent body. Still, in 2016 it was spotted in Hubble Space Telescope observations intended to search for faint companions with the same technique used to find the small satellites of Pluto. Just as for Pluto and its satellites, further observations of Makemake and orbiting moon will measure the system's mass and density and allow a broader understanding of the distant worlds. About 160 kilometers (100 miles) across compared to Makemake's 1,400 kilometer diameter, MK2's relative size and contrast are shown in this artist's vision. An imagined scene of an unexplored frontier of the Solar System, it looks back from a spacecraft's vantage as the dim Sun shines along the Milky Way.

The Largest Rock in our Solar System,"There, that dot on the right, that's the largest rock known in our Solar System. It is larger than every known asteroid, moon, and comet nucleus.  It is larger than any other local rocky planet.  This rock is so large its gravity makes it into a large ball that holds heavy gases near its surface.  (It used to be the largest known rock of any type until the recent discoveries of large dense planets orbiting other stars.)  The Voyager 1 spacecraft took the featured picture -- famously called Pale Blue Dot -- of this giant space rock in 1990 from the outer Solar System.

Kemble’s Cascade of Stars,"This line of stars is real. A little too faint to see with the unaided eye, Kemble’s Cascade of stars inspires awe when seen with binoculars.  Like the Big Dipper though, Kemble’s Cascade is an asterism, not a constellation. The asterism is visible in the northern sky toward the long-necked constellation of the Giraffe (Camelopardalis). This string of about 20 unrelated stars, each of similar brightness, spans over five times the angular width of the full moon. Stretching diagonally from the upper left to the lower right, Kemble's Cascade was popularized last century by astronomy enthusiast Lucian Kemble.

CG4: The Globule and the Galaxy,"Can a gas cloud eat a galaxy?  It's not even close.  The ""claw"" of this odd looking ""creature"" in the featured photo is a gas cloud known as a cometary globule.  This globule, however, has ruptured.  Cometary globules are typically characterized by dusty heads and elongated tails.  These features cause cometary globules to have visual similarities to comets, but in reality they are very much different.  Globules are frequently the birthplaces of stars, and many show very young stars in their heads. The reason for the rupture in the head of this object is not yet known. The galaxy to the left of the globule is huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near CG4 by chance superposition.

Messier 45: The Daughters of Atlas and Pleione,"Hurtling through a cosmic dust cloud a mere 400 light-years away, the lovely Pleiades or Seven Sisters open star cluster is well-known for its striking blue reflection nebulae. It lies in the night sky toward the constellation Taurus and the Orion Arm of our Milky Way galaxy. The sister stars are not related to the dusty cloud though. They just happen to be passing through the same region of space. Known since antiquity as a compact grouping of stars, Galileo first sketched the star cluster viewed through his telescope with stars too faint to be seen by eye. Charles Messier recorded the position of the cluster as the 45th entry in his famous catalog of things which are not comets. In Greek myth, the Pleiades were seven daughters of the astronomical titan Atlas and sea-nymph Pleione. Their parents names are included in the cluster's nine brightest stars.

The day, month, and a traditional popular name for 2022's twelve full moons are given in the chart. The apparent size of each full moon depends on how close the full lunar phase is to perigee or apogee, the closest or farthest point in the Moon's elliptical orbit. Like the 2022 Wolf Moon at the 1 o'clock position, tonight's Full Moon occurs within about two days of apogee.

Seen against a starry background Tiangong passes just below the inverted Big Dipper asterism of Ursa Major near the peak of its bright arc, and above north pole star Polaris. But less than five minutes before, the International Space Station had traced its own sunlit streak across the dark sky. Its trail begins just above the W-shape outlined by the bright stars of Cassiopeia near the northern horizon. The dramatic foreground spans an abandoned mine at Achada do Gamo in southeastern Portugal.","space, station, earth, orbit, january, illuminated, crossed, dark, predawn, moving, west, east, left, right, composited, timelapse, image, china, tiangong, traced, upper, trail, captured, hour, local, sunrise, seen, starry, background, pass, inverted, dipper, asterism, ursa, major, peak, bright, north, pole, star, polaris, minute, international, sunlit, streak, begin, w-shape, outlined, cassiopeia, northern, horizon, dramatic, foreground, span, abandoned, mine, achada, gamo, southeastern, portugal"
Where Your Elements Came From,"The hydrogen in your body, present in every molecule of water, came from the Big Bang.  There are no other appreciable sources of hydrogen in the universe.  The carbon in your body was made by nuclear fusion in the interior of stars, as was the oxygen.  Much of the iron in your body was made during supernovas of stars that occurred long ago and far away.  The gold in your jewelry was likely made from neutron stars during collisions that may have been visible as short-duration gamma-ray bursts or gravitational wave events. Elements like phosphorus and copper are present in our bodies in only small amounts but are essential to the functioning of all known life.  The featured periodic table is color coded to indicate humanity's best guess as to the nuclear origin of all known elements.  The sites of nuclear creation of some elements, such as copper, are not really well known and are continuing topics of observational and computational research.

Tails of Comet ZTF,"Comet ZTF may become visible to the unaided eye. Discovered early last year, this massive snowball has been brightening as it approaches the Sun and the Earth. C/2022 E3 (ZTF) will be closest to the Sun later this week, at which time it may become visible even without binoculars to northern observers with a clear and dark sky. As they near the Sun, comet brightnesses are notoriously hard to predict, though. In the featured image taken last week in front of a picturesque star field, three blue ion tails extend to the upper right, likely the result of a variable solar wind on ions ejected by the icy comet nucleus.  The comet's white dust tail is visible to the upper left and much shorter. The green glow is the comet's coma, caused by glowing carbon gas. Comet ZTF is expected to pass nearest the Earth in early February, after which it should dim dramatically.

NGC 2264: The Cone Nebula,"Stars are forming in the gigantic dust pillar called the Cone Nebula. Cones, pillars, and majestic flowing shapes abound in stellar nurseries where clouds of gas and dust are sculpted by energetic winds from newborn stars. The Cone Nebula, a well-known example, lies within the bright galactic star-forming region NGC 2264. The featured image of the Cone was captured recently combining 24-hours of exposure with a half-meter telescope at the El Sauce Observatory in Chile. Located about 2,500 light-years away toward the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros), the Cone Nebula's conical pillar extends about 7 light-years. The massive star NGC 2264 IRS, is the likely source of the wind sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image.  The Cone Nebula's reddish veil is produced by glowing hydrogen gas.

Spiral Aurora over Iceland,"The scene may look like a fantasy, but it's really Iceland. The rock arch is named Gatklettur and located on the island's northwest coast. Some of the larger rocks in the foreground span a meter across. The fog over the rocks is really moving waves averaged over long exposures.  The featured image is a composite of several foreground and background shots taken with the same camera and from the same location on the same night last November.  The location was picked for its picturesque foreground, but the timing was planned for its colorful background: aurora. The spiral aurora, far behind the arch, was one of the brightest seen in the astrophotographer's life.  The coiled pattern was fleeting, though, as auroral patterns waved and danced for hours during the cold night.  Far in the background were the unchanging stars, with Earth's rotation causing them to appear to slowly circle the sky's northernmost point near Polaris.

Stardust in Perseus,"This cosmic expanse of dust, gas, and stars covers some 6 degrees on the sky in the heroic constellation Perseus. At upper left in the gorgeous skyscape is the intriguing young star cluster IC 348 and neighboring Flying Ghost Nebula with clouds of obscuring interstellar dust cataloged as Barnard 3 and 4. At right, another active star forming region NGC 1333 is connected by dark and dusty tendrils on the outskirts of the giant Perseus Molecular Cloud, about 850 light-years away. Other dusty nebulae are scattered around the field of view, along with the faint reddish glow of hydrogen gas. In fact, the cosmic dust tends to hide the newly formed stars and young stellar objects or protostars from prying optical telescopes. Collapsing due to self-gravity, the protostars form from the dense cores embedded in the molecular cloud. At the molecular cloud's estimated distance, this field of view would span over 90 light-years.","stardust, perseus, cosmic, expanse, dust, star, cover, degree, heroic, constellation, upper, left, gorgeous, skyscape, intriguing, young, cluster, neighboring, flying, ghost, nebula, cloud, obscuring, interstellar, cataloged, active, forming, region, connected, dark, dusty, tendril, outskirt, giant, molecular, light-year, scattered, field, view, faint, reddish, glow, hydrogen, fact, tends, hide, formed, stellar, object, protostars, prying, optical, telescope, collapsing, self-gravity, form, dense, core, embedded, estimated, distance, span"
Young Star Cluster NGC 346,"The most massive young star cluster in the Small Magellanic Cloud is NGC 346, embedded in our small satellite galaxy's largest star forming region some 210,000 light-years distant. Of course the massive stars of NGC 346 are short lived, but very energetic.  Their winds and radiation sculpt the edges of the region's dusty molecular cloud triggering star-formation within. The star forming region also appears to contain a large population of infant stars. A mere 3 to 5 million years old and not yet burning hydrogen in their cores, the infant stars are strewn about the embedded star cluster. This spectacular infrared view of NGC 346 is from the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRcam. Emission from atomic hydrogen ionized by the massive stars' energetic radiation as well as molecular hydrogen and dust in the star-forming molecular cloud is detailed in pink and orange hues.

Perihelion Sun 2023,"Perihelion for 2023, Earth's closest approach to the Sun, was on January 4 at 16:17 UTC. That was less than 24 hours after this sharp image of the Sun's disk was recorded with telescope and H-alpha filter from Sydney, Australia, planet Earth.  An H-alpha filter transmits a characteristic red light from hydrogen atoms. In views of the Sun it emphasizes the Sun's chromosphere, a region just above the solar photosphere or normally visible solar surface.

M1: The Crab Nebula from Hubble,"This is the mess that is left when a star explodes.  The Crab Nebula, the result of a supernova seen in 1054 AD, is filled with mysterious filaments.  The filaments are not only tremendously complex, but appear to have less mass than expelled in the original supernova and a higher speed than expected from a free explosion.  The featured image, taken by the Hubble Space Telescope, is presented in three colors chosen for scientific interest.  The Crab Nebula spans about 10 light-years.  In the nebula's very center lies a pulsar: a neutron star as massive as the Sun but with only the size of a small town.  The Crab Pulsar rotates about 30 times each second.

Moon Enhanced,"Our Moon doesn't really look like this.  Earth's Moon, Luna, doesn't naturally show this rich texture, and its colors are more subtle. But this digital creation is based on reality.  The featured image is a composite of multiple images and enhanced to bring up real surface features.  The enhancements, for example, show more clearly craters that illustrate the tremendous bombardment our Moon has been through during its 4.6-billion-year history.  The dark areas, called maria, have fewer craters and were once seas of molten lava. Additionally, the image colors, although based on the moon's real composition, are changed and exaggerated.  Here, a blue hue indicates a region that is iron rich, while orange indicates a slight excess of aluminum.  Although the Moon has shown the same side to the Earth for billions of years, modern technology is allowing humanity to learn much more about it -- and how it affects the Earth.","moon, enhanced, look, earth, luna, show, rich, texture, color, subtle, digital, creation, based, reality, featured, image, composite, multiple, bring, real, surface, feature, enhancement, example, crater, illustrate, tremendous, bombardment, 4.6-billion-year, history, dark, area, called, maria, fewer, lava, composition, changed, exaggerated, blue, indicates, region, iron, orange, slight, aluminum, shown, side, year, modern, technology, allowing, humanity, much, affect"
Unexpected Clouds Toward the Andromeda Galaxy,"Why are there oxygen-emitting arcs near the direction of the Andromeda galaxy? No one is sure. The gas arcs, shown in blue, were discovered and first confirmed by amateur astronomers just last year. The two main origin hypotheses for the arcs are that they really are close to Andromeda (M31), or that they are just coincidentally placed gas filaments in our Milky Way galaxy.  Adding to the mystery is that arcs were not seen in previous deep images of M31 taken primarily in light emitted by hydrogen, and that other, more distant galaxies have not been generally noted as showing similar oxygen-emitting structures.  Dedicated amateurs using commercial telescopes made this discovery because, in part, professional telescopes usually investigate angularly small patches of the night sky, whereas these arcs span several times the angular size of the full moon.  Future observations -- both in light emitted by oxygen and by other elements -- are sure to follow.","unexpected, cloud, andromeda, galaxy, oxygen-emitting, direction, sure, shown, discovered, confirmed, amateur, astronomer, last, year, main, origin, hypothesis, close, placed, filament, milky, adding, mystery, seen, previous, deep, image, taken, light, emitted, hydrogen, distant, noted, showing, similar, structure, dedicated, using, commercial, telescope, made, discovery, part, professional, investigate, small, patch, night, span, several, time, angular, size, full, moon, future, observation, oxygen, element, follow"
MACS0647: Gravitational Lensing of the Early Universe by Webb,"Gravitational lensing by the galaxy cluster MACS0647 -- in which the massive foreground cluster distorts and lenses the light emitted by distant background galaxies along the line of sight — is on vivid display here in this recent multi-color infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope (JWST).  In particular, the background source MACS0647-JD is seen to be lensed three times by the cluster.  When first discovered with the Hubble Space Telescope, MACS0647-JD was observed as an amorphous blob.  With Webb though, this single source is revealed to be a pair or small group of galaxies.  The colors of the MACS0647-JD objects are different as well -- indicating differences potentially in the age or dust content of these galaxies.  These new images provide rare examples of galaxies in an era only a few 100 million years after the Big Bang.

The Seagull Nebula,"A broad expanse of glowing gas and dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers from planet Earth, suggesting its popular moniker - The Seagull Nebula. Using narrowband image data, this 3-panel mosaic of the cosmic bird covers a 2.5 degree swath across the plane of the Milky Way, near the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation Canis Major. Likely part of a larger shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions, the broad Seagull Nebula is cataloged as Sh2-296 and IC 2177. The prominent bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris.

Galaxy Wars: M81 and M82,"The two dominant galaxies near center are far far away, 12 million light-years distant toward the northern constellation of the Great Bear. On the right, with grand spiral arms and bright yellow core is spiral galaxy M81. Also known as Bode's galaxy, M81 spans some 100,000 light-years. On the left is cigar-shaped irregular galaxy M82.  The pair have been locked in gravitational combat for a billion years. Gravity from each galaxy has profoundly affected the other during a series of cosmic close encounters.  Their last go-round lasted about 100 million years and likely raised density waves rippling around M81, resulting in the richness of M81's spiral arms.  M82 was left with violent star forming regions and colliding gas clouds so energetic that the galaxy glows in X-rays.  In the next few billion years, their continuing gravitational encounters will result in a merger, and a single galaxy will remain. This extragalactic scenario also includes other members of the interacting M81 galaxy group with NGC 3077 below and right of the large spiral, and NGC 2976 at upper right in the frame. Captured under dark night skies in the Austrian Alps, the foreground of the wide-field image is filled with integrated flux nebulae.

Naked-eye Comet ZTF,"Comet C/2022E3 (ZTF) no longer requires a telescope for viewing. By January 19, it could just be seen with the naked eye in this rural sky with little light pollution from a location about 20 kilometers from Salamanca, Spain. Still, telescopic images are needed to show any hint of the comet's pretty green coma, stubby whitish dust tail, and long ion tail. Its faint ion tail has been buffeted by recent solar activity. This visitor from the distant Oort cloud rounded the Sun on January 12. and is now sweeping through stars near the northern boundary of the constellation Bootes.

The Colliding Spiral Galaxies of Arp 274,"Two galaxies are squaring off in Virgo and here are the latest pictures.  When two galaxies collide, the stars that compose them usually do not. This is because galaxies are mostly empty space and, however bright, stars only take up only a small fraction of that space. But during the collision, one galaxy can rip the other apart gravitationally, and dust and gas common to both galaxies does collide. If the two galaxies merge, black holes that likely resided in each galaxy center may eventually merge. Because the distances are so large, the whole thing takes place in slow motion -- over hundreds of millions of years. Besides the two large spiral galaxies, a smaller third galaxy is visible on the far left of the featured image of Arp 274, also known as NGC 5679.

LHS 475 b: Earth-Sized Exoplanet,"If you could stand on exoplanet LHS 475 b, what might you see? No one knows for sure but pictured here is an interesting guess made by an Earth-based artificial intelligence (AI) engine. The existence of the exoplanet was indicated in data taken by the Earth-orbiting TESS satellite but confirmed and further investigated only this year by the near-Earth Sun-orbiting James Webb Space Telescope. What is known for sure is that LHS 475 b has a mass very similar to our Earth and closely orbits a small red star about 40 light years away. The featured AI-illustrated guess depicts a plausibly rugged Earth-like landscape replete with molten lava and with the central red star rising in the distance. Webb data does not as yet reveal, however, whether LHS 475 b has an atmosphere.

LDN 1622: The Boogeyman Nebula,"To some, the dark shape looks like a mythical boogeyman.  Scientifically, Lynds' Dark Nebula (LDN) 1622 appears against a faint background of glowing hydrogen gas only visible in long telescopic exposures of the region. In contrast, the brighter reflection nebula vdB 62 is more easily seen just above and to the right of center in the featured image. LDN 1622 lies near the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy, close on the sky to Barnard's Loop, a large cloud surrounding the rich complex of emission nebulae found in the Belt and Sword of Orion. With swept-back outlines, the obscuring dust of LDN 1622 is thought to lie at a similar distance, perhaps 1,500 light-years away.

Active Galaxy NGC 1275,"Active galaxy NGC 1275 is the central, dominant member of the large and relatively nearby Perseus Cluster of Galaxies. Wild-looking at visible wavelengths, the active galaxy is also a prodigious source of x-rays and radio emission. NGC 1275 accretes matter as entire galaxies fall into it, ultimately feeding a supermassive black hole at the galaxy's core. This color composite image made from Hubble Space Telescope data recorded during 2006. It highlights the resulting galactic debris and filaments of glowing gas, some up to 20,000 light-years long. The filaments persist in NGC 1275, even though the turmoil of galactic collisions should destroy them.  What keeps the filaments together? Observations indicate that the structures, pushed out from the galaxy's center by the black hole's activity, are held together by magnetic fields.

Comet ZTF: Orbital Plane Crossing,"The current darling of the northern night, Comet C/2022 E3 ZTF is captured in this telescopic image from a dark sky location at June Lake, California, USA. Of course Comet ZTF has been growing brighter in recent days, headed for its closest approach to Earth on February 1.  But this view was recorded on January 23, very close to the time planet Earth crossed the orbital plane of long-period Comet ZTF. The comet's broad, whitish dust tail is still curved and fanned out away from the Sun as Comet ZTF sweeps along its orbit. Due to perspective near the orbital plane crossing, components of the fanned out dust tail appear on both sides of the comet's green tinted coma though, to lend Comet ZTF a visually striking (left) anti-tail. Buffeted by solar activity the comet's narrower ion tail also streams away from the coma diagonally to the right, across the nearly three degree wide field of view.

Comet ZTF over Mount Etna,"Comet-like plumes are blowing over the volcanic peaks of Mount Etna in this wintry mountain-and-skyscape from planet Earth. The stacked and blended combination of individual exposures recorded during the cold night of January 23, also capture naked-eye Comet ZTF just above Etna's snowy slopes. Of course the effect of increasing sunlight on the comet's nucleus and the solar wind are responsible for the comet's greenish coma and broad dusty tail. This weekend Comet ZTF is dashing across northern skies between north star Polaris and the Big Dipper. From a dark site you can only just spot it as a fuzzy patch though. That's still an impressive achievement if you consider you are gazing at a visitor from the distant Oort cloud with your own eyes.

Barnard 68: Dark Molecular Cloud,"Where did all the stars go?  What used to be considered a hole in the sky is now known to astronomers as a dark molecular cloud.  Here, a high concentration of dust and molecular gas absorb practically all the visible light emitted from background stars.  The eerily dark surroundings help make the interiors of molecular clouds some of the coldest and most isolated places in the universe.  One of the most notable of these dark absorption nebulae is a cloud toward the constellation Ophiuchus known as Barnard 68, pictured here.  That no stars are visible in the center indicates that Barnard 68 is relatively nearby, with measurements placing it about 500 light-years away and half a light-year across.  It is not known exactly how molecular clouds like Barnard 68 form, but it is known that these clouds are themselves likely places for new stars to form. In fact, Barnard 68 itself has been found likely to collapse and form a new star system. It is possible to look right through the cloud in infrared light.

Back in the old days, back when our Galaxy first formed, perhaps thousands of globular clusters roamed our Galaxy.  Today, there are less than 200 left.  Over the eons, many globular clusters were destroyed by repeated fateful encounters with each other or the Galactic center.  Surviving relics are older than any Earth fossil, older than any other structures in our Galaxy, and limit the universe itself in raw age.  There are few, if any, young globular clusters left in our Milky Way Galaxy because conditions are not ripe for more to form. The featured image shows a Hubble Space Telescope view of 13-billion year old NGC 6355, a surviving globular cluster currently passing near the Milky Way's center.  Globular cluster stars are concentrated toward the image center and highlighted by bright blue stars. Most other stars in the frame are dimmer, redder, and just coincidently lie near the direction to NGC 6355.","globular, star, cluster, hubble, ruled, milky, galaxy, formed, thousand, roamed, today, left, many, destroyed, repeated, fateful, galactic, center, surviving, relic, older, earth, fossil, structure, limit, universe, young, condition, ripe, form, featured, image, show, space, telescope, view, 13-billion, year, passing, concentrated, highlighted, bright, blue, frame, dimmer, redder, near, direction"
A Triple View of Comet ZTF,"Comet ZTF has a distinctive shape. The now bright comet visiting the inner Solar System has been showing not only a common dust tail, ion tail, and green gas coma, but also an uncommonly distinctive antitail. The antitail does not actually lead the comet -- it is just that the head of the comet is seen superposed on part of the fanned-out and trailing dust tail.  The giant dirty snowball that is Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) has now passed its closest to the Sun and tomorrow will pass its closest to the Earth. The main panel of the featured triple image shows how Comet ZTF looked last week to the unaided eye under a dark and clear sky over Cáceres, Spain.  The top inset image shows how the comet looked through binoculars, while the lower inset shows how the comet looked through a small telescope.  The comet is now visible all night long from northern latitudes but will surely fade from easy observation during the next few weeks.

The Seventh World of Trappist-1,"Seven worlds orbit the ultracool dwarf star TRAPPIST-1. A mere 40 light-years away, many of the exoplanets were discovered in 2016 using the Transiting Planets and Planetesimals Small Telescope (TRAPPIST) located at  La Silla Observatory in Chile and later confirmed with telescope including NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope. The TRAPPIST-1 planets are likely all rocky and similar in size to Earth, and so compose one of the largest treasure troves of terrestrial planets ever detected around a single star. Because they orbit very close to their faint, tiny star they could also have regions where surface temperatures allow for the presence of ice or even liquid water, a key ingredient for life. Their tantalizing proximity to Earth makes them prime candidates for future telescopic explorations of the atmospheres of potentially habitable planets.  All seven exoplanets appear in the featured illustration, which imagines a view from the most distant known world of this system, TRAPPIST-1h, as having a rocky landscape covered in ice. Meanwhile, in the imagined background, one of the system's inner planets crosses in front of the dim, orange, nearly Jupiter-sized parent star.

Reflections on the 1970s,"The 1970s are sometimes ignored by astronomers. For example, this beautiful grouping of reflection nebulae in Orion - NGC 1977, NGC 1975, and NGC 1973 - is usually overlooked in favor of the substantial glow from the nearby stellar nursery better known as the Orion Nebula. Found along Orion's sword just north of the bright Orion Nebula complex, these reflection nebulae are also associated with Orion's giant molecular cloud about 1,500 light-years away, but are dominated by the characteristic blue color of interstellar dust reflecting light from hot young stars. In this sharp color image a portion of the Orion Nebula appears along the bottom border with the cluster of reflection nebulae at picture center. NGC 1977 stretches across the field just below center, separated from NGC 1973 (above right) and NGC 1975 (above left) by dark regions laced with faint red emission from hydrogen atoms. Taken together, the dark regions suggest the popular moniker, the Running Man Nebula. At the estimated distance of Orion's dusty molecular cloud this running man would be about 15 light-years across.","reflection, ignored, astronomer, example, beautiful, grouping, orion, overlooked, favor, substantial, glow, stellar, known, nebula, found, sword, north, bright, complex, associated, giant, molecular, cloud, light-year, dominated, characteristic, blue, color, interstellar, dust, reflecting, light, young, star, sharp, image, portion, appears, bottom, border, cluster, picture, center, stretch, field, separated, left, dark, region, laced, faint, emission, hydrogen, atom, taken, suggest, popular, moniker, running, estimated, distance, dusty"
Polaris and the Trail of Comet ZTF,"Stars trace concentric arcs around the North Celestial Pole in this three hour long night sky composite, recorded with a digital camera fixed to a tripod on January 31, near Àger, Lleida, Spain. On that date Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) was near its northernmost declination in planet Earth's sky. That put the comet about 10 degrees from Earth's North Celestial Pole making the comet's position circumpolar, always above the horizon, from all locations on planet Earth at more than 10 degrees northern latitude. In the startrail image, the extension of Earth's axis of rotation into space is at the left. North star Polaris traces the short, bright, concentric arc less than a degree from the North Celestial Pole. The trail of Comet ZTF is indicated at the right, its apparent motion mostly reflecting Earth's rotation like the stars. But heading for its closest approach to planet Earth on February 1, the comet is also moving significantly with respect to the background stars. The diffuse greenish trail of Comet ZTF is an almost concentric arc mingled with startrails as it sweeps through the long-necked constellation Camelopardalis.","polaris, trail, comet, star, trace, concentric, north, celestial, pole, hour, night, composite, recorded, digital, camera, fixed, tripod, january, àger, lleida, spain, date, c/2022, northernmost, declination, planet, earth, degree, making, position, circumpolar, horizon, location, northern, latitude, startrail, image, extension, axis, rotation, space, left, short, bright, indicated, right, apparent, motion, reflecting, heading, closest, approach, february, moving, respect, diffuse, greenish, mingled, startrails, sweep, long-necked, constellation, camelopardalis"
NGC 2626 along the Vela Molecular Ridge,"Centered in this colorful cosmic canvas, NGC 2626 is a beautiful, bright, blue reflection nebula in the southern Milky Way. Next to an obscuring dust cloud and surrounded by reddish hydrogen emission from large H II region RCW 27 it lies within a complex of dusty molecular clouds known as the Vela Molecular Ridge. NGC 2626 is itself a cloud of interstellar dust reflecting blue light from the young hot embedded star visible within the nebula. But astronomical explorations reveal many other young stars and associated nebulae in the star-forming region. NGC 2626 is about 3,200 light-years away. At that distance this telescopic field of view would span about 30 light-years along the Vela Molecular Ridge.","vela, molecular, ridge, centered, colorful, cosmic, canvas, beautiful, bright, blue, reflection, nebula, southern, milky, obscuring, dust, cloud, surrounded, reddish, hydrogen, emission, large, region, complex, dusty, known, interstellar, reflecting, light, young, embedded, star, visible, astronomical, exploration, reveal, many, associated, star-forming, light-year, distance, telescopic, field, view, span"
Enceladus by Saturnshine,"This moon is shining by the light of its planet. Specifically, a large portion of Enceladus pictured here is illuminated primarily by sunlight first reflected from the planet Saturn. The result is that the normally snow-white moon appears in the gold color of Saturn's cloud tops.  As most of the illumination comes from the image left, a labyrinth of ridges throws notable shadows just to the right of the image center, while the kilometer-deep canyon Labtayt Sulci is visible just below. The bright thin crescent on the far right is the only part of Enceladus directly lit by the Sun. The featured image was taken in 2011 by the robotic Cassini spacecraft during a close pass by the enigmatic moon.  Inspection of the lower left part of this digitally sharpened image reveals plumes of ice crystals thought to originate in a below-surface sea.","enceladus, saturnshine, moon, shining, light, planet, large, portion, pictured, illuminated, sunlight, reflected, saturn, result, snow-white, appears, gold, color, cloud, illumination, come, image, left, labyrinth, ridge, throw, notable, shadow, right, center, kilometer-deep, canyon, labtayt, sulcus, visible, bright, thin, crescent, part, featured, taken, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, enigmatic, inspection, sharpened, reveals, plume, crystal, thought, originate, below-surface"
In the Heart of the Rosette Nebula,"In the heart of the Rosette Nebula lies a bright cluster of stars that lights up the nebula.  The stars of NGC 2244 formed from the surrounding gas only a few million years ago.  The featured image taken in mid-January using multiple exposures and very specific colors of Sulfur (shaded red), Hydrogen (green), and Oxygen (blue), captures the central region in tremendous detail. A hot wind of particles streams away from the cluster stars and contributes to an already complex menagerie of gas and dust filaments while slowly evacuating the cluster center.  The Rosette Nebula's center measures about 50 light-years across, lies about 5,200 light-years away, and is visible with binoculars towards the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros).

A Comet and Two Dippers,"Can you still see the comet?  Yes. Even as C/2022 E3 (ZTF) fades, there is still time to see it if you know where and when to look. Geometrically, Comet ZTF has passed its closest to both the Sun and the Earth and is now headed back to the outer Solar System. Its orbit around the Sun has it gliding across the northern sky all month, after passing near Polaris and both the Big and Little Dippers last month. Pictured, Comet ZTF was photographed between the two dippers in late January while sporting an ion tail that extended over 10 degrees. Now below naked-eye visibility, Comet ZTF can be found with binoculars or a small telescope and a good sky map.  A good time to see the comet over the next week is after the Sun sets -- but before the Moon rises.

Stellar Wind-Shaped Nebula RCW 58,"Imagine traveling to a star about 100 times as massive as our Sun, a million times more luminous, and with 30 times the surface temperature. Such stars exist, and some are known as Wolf Rayet (WR) stars, named after French astronomers Charles Wolf and Georges Rayet. The central star in this image is WR 40 which is located toward the constellation of Carina. Stars like WR 40 live fast and die young in comparison with the Sun. They quickly exhaust their core hydrogen supply, move on to fusing heavier core elements, and expand while ejecting their outer layers via high stellar winds. In this case, the central star WR 40 ejects the atmosphere at a speed of nearly 100 kilometers per second, and these outer layers have become the expanding oval-shaped nebula RCW 58.

Nacreous Clouds over Lapland,"Vivid and lustrous, wafting iridescent waves of color wash across this skyscape from Kilpisjärvi, Finland. Known as nacreous clouds or mother-of-pearl clouds, they are rare. But their unforgettable appearance was captured looking south at 69 degrees north latitude at sunset on January 24.  A type of polar stratospheric cloud, they form when unusually cold temperatures in the usually cloudless lower stratosphere form ice crystals. Still sunlit at altitudes of around 15 to 25 kilometers, the clouds can diffract sunlight even after sunset and just before the dawn.","nacreous, cloud, lapland, vivid, lustrous, wafting, iridescent, wave, color, wash, skyscape, kilpisjärvi, finland, known, mother-of-pearl, rare, unforgettable, appearance, captured, looking, degree, north, latitude, sunset, january, type, polar, stratospheric, form, cold, temperature, cloudless, lower, stratosphere, crystal, sunlit, altitude, kilometer, diffract, sunlight, dawn"
ZTF meets ATLAS,"Fading as it races across planet Earth's northern skies comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) shares this telescopic frame with comet C/2022 U2 (ATLAS). Captured on the night of February 6 from a garden observatory in Germany's Bavarian Forest, the starry field of view toward the constellation Auriga spans about 2.5 degrees. Discovered by sky survey projects in 2022 (the Zwicky Transient Facility and the Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System) these long-period comets are outbound, reaching perihelion just last month. The much fainter comet ATLAS made its closest approach to our fair planet on January 29 at a distance of about 4.6 light-minutes, compared to a mere 2.4 light-minutes for comet ZTF on February 2. This comet ATLAS lacks the well-developed tails of the formerly naked-eye comet ZTF. But both comets sport greenish tinted comas, emission from diatomic carbon molecules fluorescing in sunlight. Continuing its dash across planet Earth's sky, the good-binocular comet ZTF will appear close to bright planet Mars tonight.","meet, fading, race, planet, earth, northern, comet, c/2022, share, telescopic, frame, atlas, captured, night, february, garden, observatory, germany, bavarian, forest, starry, field, view, constellation, auriga, span, degree, discovered, survey, project, zwicky, transient, facility, asteroid, terrestrial-impact, last, alert, system, long-period, reaching, perihelion, month, made, closest, approach, fair, january, distance, light-minutes, compared, lack, well-developed, tail, naked-eye, sport, greenish, tinted, coma, emission, diatomic, carbon, molecule, fluorescing, sunlight, continuing, dash, good-binocular, appear, close, bright, tonight"
Magellanic Clouds over Chile,"The two prominent clouds in this Chilean Atacama Desert skyscape captured on January 21 actually lie beyond our Milky Way galaxy.  Known as the Large and the Small Magellanic Clouds they are so named for the 16th century Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan, leader of the first circumnavigation of planet Earth. Famous jewels of southern hemisphere skies, they are the brightest satellite galaxies of the Milky Way. The larger cloud is some 160,000 light-years, and the smaller 210,000 light-years distant. While both are irregular dwarf galaxies in their own right, they exhibit central barred structures in the deep wide-angle view. Wide and deep exposures also reveal faint dusty galactic cirrus nebulae and the imprints of gravitational tidal interactions between the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds.","magellanic, cloud, chile, prominent, chilean, atacama, desert, skyscape, captured, january, milky, galaxy, known, large, small, named, 16th, century, portuguese, explorer, ferdinand, magellan, leader, first, circumnavigation, planet, earth, famous, jewel, southern, brightest, satellite, larger, light-year, smaller, distant, irregular, dwarf, right, exhibit, central, barred, structure, deep, wide-angle, view, wide, exposure, reveal, faint, dusty, galactic, cirrus, nebula, imprint, gravitational, tidal, interaction"
Mammatus Clouds over Nebraska,"When do cloud bottoms appear like bubbles? Normally, cloud bottoms are flat. This is because moist warm air that rises and cools will condense into water droplets at a specific temperature, which usually corresponds to a very specific height.  As water droplets grow, an opaque cloud forms.  Under some conditions, however, cloud pockets can develop that contain large droplets of water or ice that fall into clear air as they evaporate.  Such pockets may occur in turbulent air near a thunderstorm.  Resulting mammatus clouds can appear especially dramatic if sunlit from the side.  The mammatus clouds pictured here were photographed over Hastings, Nebraska during 2004 June.","mammatus, cloud, nebraska, bottom, appear, bubble, flat, moist, warm, rise, cool, condense, water, droplet, specific, temperature, corresponds, height, grow, opaque, form, condition, pocket, develop, contain, large, fall, clear, evaporate, occur, turbulent, thunderstorm, resulting, dramatic, sunlit, side, pictured, photographed, hastings, june"
Comet ZTF and Mars,"No, Comet ZTF is not going to hit Mars. Nicknamed the Green Comet for its bright green coma, C/2022 E3 (ZTF) did, however, pass almost in front of the much-more distant planet a few days ago, very near in time to when the featured picture was taken. The two sky icons were here captured behind a famous Earth icon -- the Matterhorn, a mountain in the Alps between Switzerland and Italy with a  picturesque peak. Both the foreground and background images were taken on the same evening by the same camera and from the same location. The comet's  white dust tail is visible to the right of the green coma, while the light blue ion tail trails towards the top of the image. Orange Mars is well in front of the numerous background stars as well as the dark nebula Barnard 22 to its lower right. Although Mars remains visible in the evening sky for the next few months, Comet ZTF has already begun to fade as it returns to the outer Solar System.

The Heart and Soul Nebulas,"Is the heart and soul of our Galaxy located in Cassiopeia?  Possibly not, but that is where two bright emission nebulas nicknamed Heart and Soul can be found.  The Heart Nebula, officially dubbed IC 1805 and visible in the featured image on the upper right, has a shape reminiscent of a classical heart symbol.  The shape is perhaps fitting for Valentine's Day. The Soul Nebula is officially designated IC 1871 and is visible on the lower left. Both nebulas shine brightly in the red light of energized hydrogen, one of three colors shown in this three-color montage. Light takes about 6,000 years to reach us from these nebulas, which together span roughly 300 light years.

Airglow Sky over France,"This unusual sky was both familiar and unfamiliar. The photographer's mission was to capture the arch of the familiar central band of our Milky Way Galaxy over a picturesque medieval manor.  The surprise was that on this January evening, the foreground sky was found glowing in a beautiful but unfamiliar manner. The striped bands are called airglow and they result from air high in Earth's atmosphere being excited by the Sun's light and emitting a faint light of its own. The bands cross the entire sky -- their curved appearance is due to the extremely wide angle of the camera lens. In the foreground lies Château de Losse in southwest France.  Other familiar sky delights dot the distant background including the bright white star Sirius, the orange planet Mars, the blue Pleiades star cluster, the red California Nebula, and, on the far right, the extended Andromeda Galaxy.

2023 CX1 Meteor Flash,"While scanning the skies for near-Earth objects Hungarian astronomer Krisztián Sárneczky first imaged the meter-sized space rock now cataloged as 2023 CX1 on 12 February 2023 at 20:18:07 UTC. That was about 7 hours before it impacted planet Earth's atmosphere. Its predicted trajectory created a rare opportunity for meteor observers and a last minute plan resulted in this spectacular image of the fireball, captured from the Netherlands as 2023 CX1 vaporized and broke up over northern France. Remarkably it was Sárneczky's second discovery of an impacting asteroid, while 2023 CX1 is only the seventh asteroid to be detected before being successfully predicted to impact Earth. It has recently become the third such object from which meteorites have been recovered. This fireball was witnessed almost 10 years to the day following the infamous Chelyabinsk Meteor flash.","meteor, flash, scanning, near-earth, object, hungarian, astronomer, krisztián, sárneczky, imaged, meter-sized, space, rock, cataloged, february, hour, impacted, planet, earth, atmosphere, predicted, trajectory, created, rare, opportunity, last, minute, plan, resulted, spectacular, image, fireball, captured, netherlands, vaporized, broke, northern, france, second, discovery, impacting, asteroid, seventh, detected, impact, become, third, meteorite, recovered, witnessed, year, following, infamous, chelyabinsk"
Barred Spiral Galaxy NGC 1365 from Webb,"A mere 56 million light-years distant toward the southern constellation Fornax, NGC 1365 is an enormous barred spiral galaxy about 200,000 light-years in diameter. That's twice the size of our own barred spiral Milky Way. This sharp image from the James Webb Space Telescope's Mid-Infrared Instrument (MIRI) reveals stunning details of this magnificent spiral in infrared light. Webb's field of view stretches about 60,000 light-years across NGC 1365, exploring the galaxy's core and bright newborn star clusters. The intricate network of dusty filaments and bubbles is created by young stars along spiral arms winding from the galaxy's central bar. Astronomers suspect the gravity field of NGC 1365's bar plays a crucial role in the galaxy's evolution, funneling gas and dust into a star-forming maelstrom and ultimately feeding material into the active galaxy's central, supermassive black hole.","barred, spiral, galaxy, webb, light-year, distant, southern, constellation, fornax, enormous, diameter, twice, size, milky, sharp, image, james, space, telescope, mid-infrared, instrument, miri, reveals, stunning, detail, magnificent, infrared, light, field, view, stretch, exploring, core, bright, newborn, star, cluster, intricate, network, dusty, filament, bubble, created, young, winding, central, astronomer, suspect, gravity, play, crucial, role, evolution, funneling, dust, star-forming, maelstrom, feeding, material, active, supermassive, black, hole"
Seven Dusty Sisters in Infrared,"Is this really the famous Pleiades star cluster? Known for its iconic blue stars, the Pleiades is shown here in infrared light where the surrounding dust outshines the stars. Here three infrared colors have been mapped into visual colors (R=24, G=12, B=4.6 microns). The base images were taken by NASA's orbiting Wide Field Infrared Survey Explorer (WISE) spacecraft. Cataloged as M45 and nicknamed the Seven Sisters, the Pleiades star cluster is by chance situated in a passing dust cloud. The light and winds from the massive Pleiades stars preferentially repel smaller dust particles, causing the dust to become stratified into filaments, as seen. The featured image spans about 20 light years at the distance of the Pleiades, which lies about 450 light years distant toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).","dusty, sister, infrared, famous, pleiades, star, cluster, known, iconic, blue, shown, light, surrounding, dust, outshines, color, mapped, visual, r=24, g=12, b=4.6, micron, base, image, taken, nasa, orbiting, wide, field, survey, explorer, wise, spacecraft, cataloged, nicknamed, chance, situated, passing, cloud, wind, massive, repel, smaller, particle, causing, become, stratified, filament, seen, featured, span, year, distance, distant, constellation, bull, taurus"
NGC 1850: Not Found in the Milky Way,"There is nothing like this ball of stars in our Milky Way Galaxy. This is surprising because, at first glance, this featured image by the Hubble Space Telescope suggests that star cluster NGC 1850's size and shape are reminiscent of the many ancient globular star clusters which roam our own Milky Way Galaxy's halo.  But NGC 1850's stars are all too young, making it a type of star cluster with no known counterpart in the Milky Way.  Moreover, NGC 1850 is also a double star cluster, with a second, compact cluster of stars visible here just to the right of the large cluster's center.  Stars in the large cluster are estimated to be 50 million years young, while stars in the compact cluster are younger still, with an age of about 4 million years.  A mere 168,000 light-years distant, NGC 1850 is located near the outskirts of the Large Magellanic Cloud galaxy.  The glowing gas filaments across the image left, like supernova remnants in our own galaxy, testify to violent stellar explosions and indicate that short-lived massive stars have recently been present in the region.","found, milky, nothing, ball, star, galaxy, surprising, first, glance, featured, image, hubble, space, telescope, suggests, cluster, size, shape, reminiscent, many, ancient, globular, roam, halo, young, making, type, known, counterpart, double, second, compact, visible, right, large, center, estimated, year, younger, light-year, distant, located, outskirt, magellanic, cloud, glowing, filament, left, supernova, remnant, testify, violent, stellar, explosion, indicate, short-lived, massive, present, region"
Comet ZTF  over Yosemite Falls,"They are both falling. The water in Yosemite Falls, California, USA, is falling toward the Earth. Comet ZTF is falling toward the Sun. This double cosmic cascade was captured late last month as fading Comet C/2022 E3 (ZTF) had just passed its closest to planet Earth. The orange star just over the falls is Kochab. With the exception of a brief encounter with a black bear, the featured image was a well-planned composite of a moonlit-foreground and long-duration background exposures - all designed to reconstruct a deep version of an actual single sight.

Our Increasingly Active Sun,"Our Sun is becoming a busy place.  Only two years ago, the Sun was emerging from a solar minimum so quiet that months would go by without even a single sunspot.  In contrast, already this year and well ahead of schedule, our Sun is unusually active, already nearing solar activity levels seen a decade ago during the last solar maximum.  Our increasingly active Sun was captured two weeks ago sporting numerous interesting features. The image was recorded in a single color of light called Hydrogen Alpha, color-inverted, and false colored.  Spicules carpet much of the Sun's face.  The brightening towards the Sun's edges is caused by increased absorption of relatively cool solar gas and called limb darkening.  Just outside the Sun's disk, several scintillating prominences protrude, while prominences on the Sun's face are known as filaments and show as light streaks.  Magnetically tangled active regions are both dark and light and contain cool sunspots.  As our Sun's magnetic field winds toward solar maximum over the next few years, whether the Sun's high activity will continue to increase is unknown.","active, becoming, busy, place, year, emerging, solar, minimum, quiet, month, single, sunspot, contrast, schedule, nearing, activity, level, seen, decade, last, maximum, captured, week, sporting, numerous, interesting, feature, image, recorded, color, light, called, hydrogen, alpha, color-inverted, false, colored, spicule, carpet, much, face, brightening, edge, caused, increased, absorption, cool, limb, darkening, outside, disk, several, scintillating, prominence, protrude, known, filament, show, streak, tangled, region, dark, contain, magnetic, field, wind, next, high, continue, increase, unknown"
Arp 78: Peculiar Galaxy in Aries,"Peculiar spiral galaxy Arp 78 is found within the boundaries of the head strong constellation Aries. Some 100 million light-years beyond the stars and nebulae of our Milky Way galaxy, the island universe is an enormous 200,000 light-years across. Also known as NGC 772, it sports a prominent, outer spiral arm in this detailed cosmic portrait. Tracking along sweeping dust lanes and lined with young blue star clusters, Arp 78's overdeveloped spiral arm is pumped-up by galactic-scale gravitational tides. Interactions with its brightest companion galaxy, the more compact NGC 770 seen above and right of the larger spiral, are likely responsible. Embedded in faint star streams revealed in the deep telescopic exposure, NGC 770's fuzzy, elliptical appearance contrasts nicely with spiky foreground Milky Way stars in matching yellowish hues.","peculiar, galaxy, aries, spiral, found, boundary, head, strong, constellation, light-year, star, nebula, milky, island, universe, enormous, across, known, sport, prominent, detailed, cosmic, portrait, tracking, sweeping, dust, lane, lined, young, blue, cluster, overdeveloped, pumped-up, galactic-scale, gravitational, tide, interaction, brightest, companion, compact, seen, larger, responsible, embedded, faint, stream, revealed, deep, telescopic, exposure, fuzzy, elliptical, appearance, contrast, spiky, foreground, matching, yellowish"
Jones-Emberson 1,"Planetary nebula Jones-Emberson 1 is the death shroud of a dying Sun-like star. It lies some 1,600 light-years from Earth toward the sharp-eyed constellation Lynx. About 4 light-years across, the expanding remnant of the dying star's atmosphere was shrugged off into interstellar space, as the star's central supply of hydrogen and then helium for fusion was finally depleted after billions of years. Visible near the center of the planetary nebula is what remains of the stellar core, a blue-hot white dwarf star.  Also known as PK 164 +31.1, the nebula is faint and very difficult to glimpse at a telescope's eyepiece. But this deep broadband image combining 22 hours of exposure time does show it off in exceptional detail. Stars within our own Milky Way galaxy as well as background galaxies across the universe are scattered through the clear field of view. Ephemeral on the cosmic stage, Jones-Emberson 1 will fade away over the next few thousand years. Its hot, central white dwarf star will take billions of years to cool.","jones-emberson, planetary, death, shroud, dying, sun-like, star, light-year, earth, sharp-eyed, constellation, lynx, expanding, remnant, atmosphere, shrugged, interstellar, space, central, supply, hydrogen, helium, fusion, depleted, year, visible, center, nebula, remains, stellar, core, blue-hot, white, dwarf, known, +31.1, faint, difficult, glimpse, telescope, eyepiece, deep, broadband, image, combining, hour, exposure, time, show, exceptional, detail, milky, galaxy, universe, scattered, clear, field, view, ephemeral, cosmic, stage, fade, next, take, cool"
Crescent Moon Occultation,"On February 22, a young Moon shared the western sky at sunset with bright planets Venus and Jupiter along the ecliptic plane. The beautiful celestial conjunction was visible around planet Earth. But from some locations Jupiter hid for a while, occulted by the crescent lunar disk. The Solar System's ruling gas giant was captured here just before it disappeared behind the Moon's dark edge, seen over the Río de la Plata at Colonia del Sacramento, Uruguay.  In the serene river and skyscape Venus is not so shy, shining brightly closer to the horizon through the fading twilight. Next week Venus and Jupiter will appear even closer in your evening sky.","crescent, moon, occultation, february, young, shared, western, sunset, bright, planet, venus, jupiter, ecliptic, plane, beautiful, celestial, conjunction, visible, earth, location, occulted, lunar, disk, solar, system, ruling, giant, captured, disappeared, dark, edge, seen, colonia, sacramento, uruguay, serene, river, skyscape, shining, horizon, fading, twilight, next, week, appear, evening"
Saturn's Iapetus: Moon with a Strange Surface,"What would make a moon look like a walnut?  A strange ridge that circles Saturn's moon Iapetus's equator, visible near the bottom of the featured image, makes it appear similar to a popular edible nut.  The origin of the ridge remains unknown, though, with hypotheses including ice that welled up from below, a ring that crashed down from above, and structure left over from its formation perhaps 100 million years ago. Also strange is that about half of Iapetus is so dark that it can nearly disappear when viewed from Earth, while the rest is, reflectively, quite bright. Observations show that the degree of darkness of the terrain is strangely uniform, as if a dark coating was somehow recently applied to an ancient and highly cratered surface.  Last, several large impact basins occur around Iapetus, with a 400-kilometer wide crater visible near the image center, surrounded by deep cliffs that drop sharply to the crater floor.  The featured image was taken by the Saturn-orbiting Cassini spacecraft during a flyby of Iapetus at the end of 2004.","saturn, iapetus, moon, strange, surface, make, look, walnut, ridge, circle, equator, visible, bottom, featured, image, appear, similar, popular, edible, origin, remains, unknown, hypothesis, including, welled, ring, crashed, structure, left, formation, year, half, dark, disappear, viewed, earth, rest, bright, observation, show, degree, darkness, terrain, uniform, coating, applied, ancient, cratered, last, several, large, impact, basin, occur, 400-kilometer, wide, crater, center, surrounded, deep, cliff, drop, floor, taken, saturn-orbiting, cassini, spacecraft, flyby"
Zodiacal Ray with Venus and Jupiter,"What's causing that unusual ray of light extending from the horizon? Dust orbiting the Sun. At certain times of the year, a band of sun-reflecting dust from the inner Solar System appears prominently after sunset or before sunrise and is called zodiacal light.  The dust was emitted mostly from faint Jupiter-family comets and slowly spirals into the Sun. The featured HDR image, acquired in mid-February from the Sierra Nevada National Park in Spain, captures the glowing band of zodiacal light going right in front of the bright evening planets Jupiter (upper) and Venus (lower). Emitted from well behind the zodiacal light is a dark night sky that prominently includes the Pleiades star cluster. Jupiter and Venus are slowly switching places in the evening sky, and just in the next few days nearing their closest angular approach.","zodiacal, venus, jupiter, causing, unusual, light, extending, horizon, dust, orbiting, certain, time, year, sun-reflecting, inner, solar, system, appears, sunset, sunrise, called, emitted, faint, jupiter-family, comet, spiral, featured, image, acquired, mid-february, sierra, nevada, national, park, spain, capture, glowing, band, going, right, front, bright, evening, planet, upper, dark, night, includes, pleiades, star, cluster, switching, place, next, nearing, closest, angular, approach"
Crescent Moon Beyond Greek Temple,"Why is a thin crescent moon never seen far from a horizon? Because the only geometry that gives a thin crescent lunar phase occurs when the Moon appears close to the Sun in the sky.  The crescent is not caused by the shadow of the Earth, but by seeing only a small part of the Moon directly illuminated by the Sun.  Moreover, the thickest part of the crescent always occurs in the direction of the Sun.  In the evening, a thin crescent Moon will set shortly after the Sun and not be seen for the rest of the night. Alternatively, in the morning, a crescent Moon will rise shortly before the Sun after not being seen for most of the night. Pictured two weeks ago, a crescent moon was captured near the horizon, just before sunrise, far behind remnants of the ancient Temple of Poseidon in Greece.","crescent, moon, greek, temple, thin, seen, horizon, geometry, give, lunar, phase, occurs, appears, close, caused, shadow, earth, seeing, small, part, illuminated, moreover, thickest, direction, evening, rest, night, morning, rise, pictured, week, captured, sunrise, remnant, ancient, poseidon, greece"
The Flaming Star Nebula,"Is star AE Aurigae on fire? No.  Even though AE Aurigae is named the Flaming Star and the surrounding nebula IC 405 is named the Flaming Star Nebula, and even though the nebula appears to some like a swirling flame, there is no fire.  Fire, typically defined as the rapid molecular acquisition of oxygen, happens only when sufficient oxygen is present and is not important in such high-energy, low-oxygen environments such as stars.  The bright star AE Aurigae occurs near the center of the Flaming Star Nebula and is so hot it glows blue, emitting light so energetic it knocks electrons away from surrounding gas. When a proton recaptures an electron, light is emitted, as seen in the surrounding emission nebula.  Captured here three weeks ago, the Flaming Star Nebula is visible near the composite image's center, between the red Tadpole Nebula on the left and blue-tailed Comet ZTF on the right.  The Flaming Star Nebula lies about 1,500 light years distant, spans about 5 light years, and is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Charioteer (Auriga).","flaming, star, nebula, aurigae, fire, named, surrounding, appears, swirling, flame, defined, rapid, molecular, acquisition, oxygen, happens, sufficient, present, important, high-energy, low-oxygen, environment, bright, occurs, center, glow, blue, emitting, light, energetic, knock, electron, proton, recapture, emitted, seen, emission, captured, week, visible, composite, image, tadpole, left, blue-tailed, comet, year, distant, span, small, telescope, constellation, charioteer, auriga"
Unraveling NGC 3169,"Spiral galaxy NGC 3169 looks to be unraveling like a ball of cosmic yarn. It lies some 70 million light-years away, south of bright star Regulus toward the faint constellation Sextans. Wound up spiral arms are pulled out into sweeping tidal tails as NGC 3169 (left) and neighboring NGC 3166 interact gravitationally. Eventually the galaxies will merge into one, a common fate even for bright galaxies in the local universe. Drawn out stellar arcs and plumes are clear indications of the ongoing gravitational interactions across the deep and colorful galaxy group photo. The telescopic frame spans about 20 arc minutes or about 400,000 light-years at the group's estimated distance, and includes smaller, bluish NGC 3165 at the right. NGC 3169 is also known to shine across the spectrum from radio to X-rays, harboring an active galactic nucleus that is the site of a supermassive black hole.","unraveling, spiral, galaxy, look, ball, cosmic, yarn, light-year, south, bright, star, regulus, faint, constellation, sextans, pulled, sweeping, tidal, tail, left, neighboring, interact, merge, common, fate, local, universe, drawn, stellar, plume, clear, indication, ongoing, gravitational, interaction, deep, colorful, group, photo, telescopic, frame, span, minute, estimated, distance, includes, smaller, bluish, right, known, shine, spectrum, radio, x-ray, harboring, active, galactic, nucleus, site, supermassive, black, hole"
RCW 86: Historical Supernova Remnant,"In 185 AD, Chinese astronomers recorded the appearance of a new star in the Nanmen asterism. That part of the sky is identified with Alpha and Beta Centauri on modern star charts. The new star was visible to the naked-eye for months, and is now thought to be the earliest recorded supernova. This deep telescopic view reveals the wispy outlines of emission nebula RCW 86, just visible against the starry background, understood to be the remnant of that stellar explosion. Captured by the wide-field Dark Energy Camera operating at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile, the image traces the full extent of a ragged shell of gas ionized by the still expanding shock wave. Space-based images indicate an abundance of the element iron in RCW 86 and the absence of a neutron star or pulsar within the remnant, suggesting that the original supernova was Type Ia. Unlike the core collapse supernova explosion of a massive star, a Type Ia supernova is a thermonuclear detonation on a white dwarf star that accretes material from a companion in a binary star system. Near the plane of our Milky Way galaxy and larger than the full moon on the sky this supernova remnant is too faint to be seen by eye though. RCW 86 is some 8,000 light-years distant and around 100 light-years across.","historical, supernova, remnant, chinese, astronomer, recorded, star, nanmen, asterism, part, identified, alpha, beta, centauri, modern, chart, visible, naked-eye, month, thought, deep, telescopic, view, reveals, wispy, outline, emission, nebula, starry, background, understood, stellar, explosion, captured, wide-field, dark, energy, camera, operating, cerro, tololo, inter-american, observatory, chile, image, trace, full, extent, ragged, shell, ionized, expanding, shock, wave, space-based, indicate, abundance, element, iron, absence, neutron, pulsar, suggesting, original, type, core, collapse, massive, thermonuclear, detonation, white, dwarf, accretes, material, companion, binary, system, plane, milky, galaxy, larger, moon, faint, seen, light-year, distant"
10 Days of Venus and Jupiter,"Venus and Jupiter may have caught your attention lately.  The impending close conjunction of the two brightest planets visible in clear evening skies has been hard to miss. With Jupiter at the top, starting on February 21 and ending on March 2, their close approach is chronicled daily, left to right, in these panels from Dhanbad, India. Near the western horizon, the evening sky colors and exposures used for each panel depend on the local conditions near sunset. On February 22, Jupiter and Venus were joined by the young crescent Moon. The celestial pair appeared to be only the width of a full moon apart by March 2. Of course on that date the two planets were physically separated by over 600 million kilometers in their orbits around the Sun. In the coming days Jupiter will slowly settle into the glare at sunset, but Venus will continue to move farther from the Sun in the western sky to excel in its current role as the brilliant evening star.

Jupiter and Venus over Italy,"What are those two bright spots? Planets.  A few days ago, the two brightest planets in the night sky passed within a single degree of each other in what is termed a conjunction. Visible just after sunset in much of the world, the two bright spots were Jupiter (left) and Venus (right).  The featured image was taken near closest approach from Cirica, Sicily, Italy. The week before, Venus was rising higher in the sunset sky to meet the dropping Jupiter. Now they have switched places. Of course, Venus remains much closer to both the Sun and the Earth than Jupiter -- the apparent closeness between the planets in the sky of Earth was only angular.  You can still see the popular pair for an hour or so after sunset this month although they continue to separate, and Jupiter continues to set earlier each night.

Jupiter and Venus from Earth,"It was visible around the world. The sunset conjunction of Jupiter and Venus in 2012 was visible almost no matter where you lived on Earth.  Anyone on the planet with a clear western horizon at sunset could see them. Pictured here in 2012, a creative photographer traveled away from the town lights of Szubin, Poland to image a near closest approach of the two planets. The bright planets were then separated only by three degrees and his daughter struck a humorous pose. A faint red sunset still glowed in the background. Jupiter and Venus are together again this month after sunset, passing within a degree of each other about a week ago.

Deep Field: The Large Magellanic Cloud,"Is this a spiral galaxy? No. Actually, it is the Large Magellanic Cloud (LMC), the largest satellite galaxy of our own Milky Way Galaxy.  The LMC is classified as a dwarf irregular galaxy because of its normally chaotic appearance.  In this deep and wide exposure, however, the full extent of the LMC becomes visible.  Surprisingly, during longer exposures, the LMC begins to resemble a barred spiral galaxy.  The Large Magellanic Cloud lies only about 180,000 light-years distant towards the constellation of the Dolphinfish (Dorado).  Spanning about 15,000 light-years, the LMC was the site of SN1987A, the brightest and closest supernova in modern times. Together with the Small Magellanic Cloud (SMC), the LMC can be seen in Earth's southern hemisphere with the unaided eye.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

Artificial Night Sky Brightness,"Where have all the dim stars gone?  From many places on the Earth including major cities, the night sky has been reduced from a fascinating display of thousands of stars to a diffuse glow through which only a few stars are visible.  The featured map indicates the relative amount of light pollution that occurs across the Earth.  The cause of the pollution is artificial light reflecting off molecules and aerosols in the atmosphere.  Parts of the Eastern United States and Western Europe  colored red, for example, have an artificial night sky glow over ten times that of the natural sky.  In any area marked orange or red, the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy is no longer visible. The International Dark Sky Association suggests common types of fixtures that provide relatively little amounts of light pollution.

DART vs Dimorphos,"On the first planetary defense test mission from planet Earth, the DART spacecraft captured this close-up on 26 September 2022, three seconds before slamming into the surface of asteroid moonlet Dimorphos. The spacecraft's outline with two long solar panels is traced at its projected point of impact between two boulders. The larger boulder is about 6.5 meters across. While the DART (Double Asteroid Redirection Test) spacecraft had a mass of some 570 kilograms, the estimated mass of Dimorphos, the smaller member of a near-Earth binary asteroid system, was about 5 billion kilograms. The direct kinetic impact of the spacecraft measurably altered the speed of Dimorphos by a fraction of a percent, reducing its 12 hour orbital period around its larger companion asteroid 65803 Didymos by about 33 minutes. Beyond successfully demonstrating a technique to change an asteroid's orbit that can prevent future asteroid strikes on planet Earth, the planetary-scale impact experiment has given the 150-meter-sized Dimorphos a comet-like tail of material.","dart, dimorphos, planetary, defense, test, mission, planet, earth, spacecraft, captured, close-up, september, second, slamming, surface, asteroid, moonlet, outline, long, solar, panel, traced, projected, point, impact, boulder, larger, meter, double, redirection, mass, kilogram, estimated, smaller, member, near-earth, binary, system, direct, kinetic, altered, speed, fraction, percent, reducing, hour, orbital, period, companion, didymos, minute, demonstrating, technique, change, orbit, prevent, future, strike, planetary-scale, experiment, given, 150-meter-sized, comet-like, tail, material"
Orion and the Running Man,"Few cosmic vistas excite the imagination like The Great Nebula in Orion. Visible as a faint celestial smudge to the naked-eye, the nearest large star-forming region sprawls across this sharp telescopic image, recorded on a cold January night in dark skies from West Virginia, planet Earth. Also known as M42, the Orion Nebula's glowing gas surrounds hot, young stars. About 40 light-years across, it lies at the edge of an immense interstellar molecular cloud only 1,500 light-years away within the same spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy as the Sun. Along with dusty bluish reflection nebula NGC 1977 and friends near the top of the frame, the eye-catching nebulae represent only a small fraction of our galactic neighborhood's wealth of star-forming material. Within the well-studied stellar nursery, astronomers have also identified what appear to be numerous infant solar systems.","orion, running, cosmic, vista, excite, imagination, great, nebula, visible, faint, celestial, smudge, naked-eye, nearest, large, star-forming, region, sprawl, sharp, telescopic, image, recorded, cold, january, night, dark, west, virginia, planet, earth, known, glowing, surround, young, star, light-year, edge, immense, interstellar, molecular, cloud, spiral, milky, galaxy, dusty, bluish, reflection, friend, frame, eye-catching, represent, small, fraction, galactic, neighborhood, wealth, material, well-studied, stellar, nursery, astronomer, identified, appear, numerous, infant, solar, system"
3D Bennu,"Put on your red/blue glasses and float next to asteroid 101955 Bennu. Shaped like a spinning toy top with boulders littering its rough surface, the tiny Solar System world is about one Empire State Building (less than 500 meters) across. Frames used to construct this 3D anaglyph were taken by PolyCam on the OSIRIS_REx spacecraft on December 3, 2018 from a distance of about 80 kilometers. With a sample from the asteroid's rocky surface on board, OSIRIS_REx departed Bennu's vicinity in May of 2021 and is now enroute to planet Earth.

Saturn's Hyperion: A Moon with Odd Craters,"What lies at the bottom of Hyperion's strange craters?  To help find out, the robot Cassini spacecraft that once orbited Saturn swooped past the sponge-textured moon and took images of unprecedented detail.  A six-image mosaic from the 2005 pass, featured here in scientifically assigned colors, shows a remarkable world strewn with strange craters and an odd, sponge-like surface.   At the bottom of most craters lies some type of unknown dark reddish material.  This material appears similar to that covering part of another of Saturn's moons, Iapetus, and might sink into the ice moon as it better absorbs warming sunlight. Hyperion is about 250 kilometers across,  rotates chaotically, and has a density so low that it likely houses a vast system of caverns inside.","saturn, hyperion, moon, crater, bottom, strange, help, find, robot, cassini, spacecraft, orbited, swooped, past, sponge-textured, took, image, unprecedented, detail, six-image, mosaic, featured, assigned, color, show, remarkable, world, strewn, sponge-like, surface, type, unknown, dark, reddish, material, appears, similar, covering, part, iapetus, sink, absorbs, warming, sunlight, kilometer, rotates, density, likely, house, vast, system, cavern"
Rainbow Tree,"What lies at the end of a rainbow? Something different for everyone.  For the photographer taking this picture, for example, one end of the rainbow ended at a tree. Others nearby, though, would likely see the rainbow end somewhere else.  The reason is because a rainbow's position depends on the observer.  The center of a rainbow always appears in the direction opposite the Sun, but that direction lines up differently on the horizon from different locations. This rainbow's arc indicates that its center is about 40 degrees to the left and slightly below the horizon, while the Sun is well behind the camera and just above the horizon. Reflections and refractions of sunlight from raindrops in a distant storm in the direction of the rainbow are what causes the colorful bands of light. This single exposure image was captured in early January near Knight's Ferry, California, USA.","rainbow, tree, something, different, everyone, photographer, taking, picture, example, ended, others, reason, position, depends, center, appears, direction, opposite, line, horizon, location, indicates, degree, left, camera, reflection, refraction, sunlight, raindrop, distant, storm, cause, colorful, band, light, single, exposure, image, captured, early, january, knight, ferry, california"
W5: The Soul Nebula,"Stars are forming in the Soul of the Queen of Aethopia. More specifically, a large star forming region called the Soul Nebula can be found in the direction of the constellation Cassiopeia, whom Greek mythology credits as the vain wife of a King who long ago ruled lands surrounding the upper Nile river. Also known as Westerhout 5 (W5), the Soul Nebula houses several open clusters of stars, ridges and pillars darkened by cosmic dust, and huge evacuated bubbles formed by the winds of young massive stars. Located about 6,500 light years away, the Soul Nebula spans about 100 light years and is usually imaged next to its celestial neighbor the Heart Nebula (IC 1805). The featured image is a composite of exposures made in different colors: red as emitted by hydrogen gas, yellow as emitted by sulfur, and blue as emitted by oxygen.","soul, nebula, star, forming, queen, aethopia, large, region, called, found, direction, constellation, cassiopeia, greek, mythology, credit, vain, wife, king, ruled, land, surrounding, upper, nile, river, known, house, several, open, cluster, ridge, pillar, darkened, cosmic, dust, huge, evacuated, bubble, formed, wind, young, massive, located, light, year, span, imaged, next, celestial, neighbor, heart, featured, image, composite, exposure, made, different, color, emitted, hydrogen, yellow, sulfur, blue, oxygen"
Jupiter and Venus Converge over Germany,"This was a sky to show the kids. Early this month the two brightest planets in the night sky, Jupiter and Venus, appeared to converge. At their closest, the two planets were separated by only about the angular width of the full moon. The spectacle occurred just after sunset and was seen and photographed all across planet Earth. The displayed image was taken near to the time of closest approach from Wiltingen, Germany, and features the astrophotographer, spouse, and their two children.  Of course, Venus remains much closer to both the Sun and the Earth than Jupiter -- the apparent closeness between the planets in the sky of Earth was only angular.  Jupiter and Venus have passed and now appear increasingly far apart. Similar planetary convergence opportunities will eventually arise.  In a few months, for example, Mars and Venus will appear to congregate just as the Sun sets.

Millions of Stars in Omega Centauri,"Globular star cluster Omega Centauri, also known as NGC 5139, is 15,000 light-years away. The cluster is packed with about 10 million stars much older than the Sun within a volume about 150 light-years in diameter. It's the largest and brightest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. Omega Centauri's red giant stars (with a yellowish hue) are easy to pick out in this sharp, color telescopic view.","star, omega, centauri, globular, cluster, known, light-year, packed, much, older, volume, diameter, largest, brightest, roam, halo, milky, galaxy, consist, composition, enigmatic, exhibit, presence, different, stellar, population, spread, chemical, abundance, fact, remnant, core, small, merging, giant, yellowish, easy, pick, sharp, color, telescopic, view"
The Medusa Nebula,"Braided and serpentine filaments of glowing gas suggest this nebula's popular name, The Medusa Nebula. Also known as Abell 21, this Medusa is an old planetary nebula some 1,500 light-years away in the constellation Gemini. Like its mythological namesake, the nebula is associated with a dramatic transformation. The planetary nebula phase represents a final stage in the evolution of low mass stars like the sun as they transform themselves from red giants to hot white dwarf stars and in the process shrug off their outer layers. Ultraviolet radiation from the hot star powers the nebular glow. The Medusa's transforming star is the faint one near the center of the overall bright crescent shape.

Wolf-Rayet 124,"Driven by powerful stellar winds, expanding shrouds of gas and dust frame hot, luminous star Wolf-Rayet 124 in this sharp infrared view. The eye-catching 6-spike star pattern is characteristic of stellar images made with the 18 hexagonal mirrors of the James Webb Space Telescope. About 15,000 light-years distant toward the pointed northern constellation Sagitta, WR 124 has over 30 times the mass of the Sun. Produced in a brief and rarely spotted phase of massive star evolution in the Milky Way, this star's turbulent nebula is nearly 6 light-years across. It heralds WR 124's impending stellar death in a supernova explosion.  Formed in the expanding nebula, dusty interstellar debris that survives the supernova will influence the formation of future generations of stars.","driven, powerful, stellar, wind, expanding, shroud, dust, frame, luminous, star, sharp, infrared, view, eye-catching, 6-spike, pattern, characteristic, image, made, hexagonal, mirror, james, webb, space, telescope, light-year, distant, pointed, northern, constellation, sagitta, time, mass, produced, brief, spotted, phase, massive, evolution, turbulent, nebula, herald, impending, death, supernova, explosion, formed, dusty, interstellar, debris, survives, influence, formation, future, generation"
Equinox at the Pyramid of the Feathered Serpent,"To see the feathered serpent descend the Mayan pyramid requires exquisite timing.  You must visit El Castillo -- in Mexico's Yucatán Peninsula -- near an equinox.  Then, during the late afternoon if the sky is clear, the pyramid's own shadows create triangles that merge into the famous illusion of a slithering viper.  Also known as the Temple of Kukulkan, the impressive step-pyramid stands 30 meters tall and 55 meters wide at the base.  Built up as a series of square terraces by the pre-Columbian civilization between the 9th and 12th century, the structure can be used as a calendar and is noted for astronomical alignments. The featured composite image was captured in 2019 with Jupiter and Saturn straddling the diagonal central band of our Milky Way galaxy. Tomorrow marks another equinox -- not only at Temple of Kukulcán, but all over planet Earth.","equinox, pyramid, feathered, serpent, descend, mayan, requires, exquisite, timing, visit, castillo, mexico, yucatán, peninsula, late, afternoon, clear, shadow, create, triangle, merge, famous, illusion, slithering, viper, known, temple, kukulkan, impressive, step-pyramid, stand, meter, tall, wide, base, built, series, square, pre-columbian, civilization, 12th, century, structure, used, calendar, noted, astronomical, alignment, featured, composite, image, captured, jupiter, saturn, straddling, diagonal, central, band, milky, galaxy, tomorrow, mark, kukulcán, planet, earth"
M1: The Expanding Crab Nebula,"Are your eyes good enough to see the Crab Nebula expand?  The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first on Charles Messier's famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across today, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of over 1,000 kilometers per second. Over the past decade, its expansion has been documented in this stunning time-lapse movie. In each year from 2008 to 2022, an image was produced with the same telescope and camera from a remote observatory in Austria. The sharp, processed frames even reveal the dynamic energetic emission surrounding the rapidly spinning pulsar at the center.  The Crab Nebula lies about 6,500 light-years away toward the constellation of the Bull (Taurus).","expanding, crab, nebula, good, expand, cataloged, first, charles, messier, famous, list, thing, comet, fact, known, supernova, remnant, cloud, debris, explosion, massive, star, violent, birth, witnessed, astronomer, year, light-year, today, rate, kilometer, second, past, decade, expansion, documented, stunning, time-lapse, movie, image, produced, camera, remote, observatory, austria, sharp, processed, frame, reveal, dynamic, energetic, emission, surrounding, spinning, pulsar, center, constellation, bull, taurus"
Dark Nebulae and Star Formation in Taurus,"Can dust be beautiful? Yes, and it can also be useful.  The Taurus molecular cloud has several bright stars, but it is the dark dust that really draws attention.  The pervasive dust has waves and ripples and makes picturesque dust bunnies, but perhaps more importantly, it marks regions where interstellar gas is dense enough to gravitationally contract to form stars. In the image center is a light cloud lit by neighboring stars that is home not only to a famous nebula, but to a very young and massive famous star.  Both the star, T Tauri, and the nebula, Hind's Variable Nebula, are seen to vary dramatically in brightness -- but not necessarily at the same time, adding to the mystery of this intriguing region. T Tauri and similar stars are now generally recognized to be Sun-like stars that are less than a few million years old and so still in the early stages of formation. The featured image spans about four degrees not far from the Pleiades star cluster, while the featured dust field lies about 400 light-years away.","dark, nebula, star, formation, taurus, dust, beautiful, useful, molecular, cloud, several, bright, draw, attention, pervasive, wave, ripple, make, picturesque, bunny, mark, region, interstellar, dense, enough, contract, form, image, center, light, neighboring, home, famous, young, massive, tauri, hind, variable, seen, vary, time, adding, mystery, intriguing, similar, recognized, sun-like, less, year, early, stage, featured, degree, pleiades, cluster, field, light-year"
M31: The Andromeda Galaxy,"How far can you see? The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy, over two million light-years away.  Without a telescope, even this immense spiral galaxy appears as an unremarkable, faint, nebulous cloud in the constellation Andromeda.  But a bright white nucleus, dark winding dust lanes, luminous blue spiral arms, and bright red emission nebulas are recorded in this stunning fifteen-hour telescopic digital mosaic of our closest major galactic neighbor.  But how do we know this spiral nebula is really so far away? This question was central to the famous Shapley-Curtis debate of 1920.  M31's great distance was determined in the 1920s by observations that resolved individual stars that changed their brightness in a way that gave up their true distance. The result proved that Andromeda is just like our Milky Way Galaxy -- a conclusion making the rest of the universe much more vast than had ever been previously imagined.","andromeda, galaxy, distant, object, visible, unaided, great, light-year, telescope, immense, spiral, appears, unremarkable, faint, nebulous, cloud, constellation, bright, white, nucleus, dark, winding, dust, lane, luminous, blue, emission, recorded, stunning, fifteen-hour, telescopic, digital, mosaic, closest, major, galactic, neighbor, know, nebula, question, central, famous, shapley-curtis, debate, distance, determined, observation, resolved, individual, star, changed, brightness, gave, true, result, proved, milky, conclusion, making, rest, universe, vast, imagined"
Spiral Galaxy NGC 2841,"A mere 46 million light-years distant, spiral galaxy NGC 2841 can be found in planet Earth's night sky toward the northern constellation of Ursa Major. This sharp image centered on the gorgeous island universe also captures spiky foreground Milky Way stars and more distant background galaxies within the same telescopic field of view. It shows off the bright nucleus of NGC 2841, along with its inclined galactic disk, and faint outer regions.  Dust lanes, small star-forming regions, and young star clusters are embedded in the galaxy's patchy, tightly wound spiral arms. In contrast, many other spirals exhibit broader, sweeping arms with large star-forming regions.  NGC 2841 has a diameter of over 150,000 light-years, making it even larger than our own Milky Way. X-ray images suggest that extreme outflows from giant stars and stellar explosions create plumes of hot gas extending into a halo around NGC 2841.","spiral, galaxy, light-year, distant, found, planet, earth, night, northern, constellation, major, sharp, image, centered, gorgeous, island, universe, capture, spiky, foreground, milky, star, background, telescopic, field, view, show, bright, inclined, galactic, disk, faint, outer, region, dust, lane, small, star-forming, young, cluster, embedded, patchy, contrast, many, exhibit, broader, sweeping, large, diameter, making, larger, x-ray, suggest, extreme, outflow, giant, stellar, explosion, create, plume, extending, halo"
Outbound Comet ZTF,"Former darling of the northern sky Comet C/2022E3 (ZTF) has faded. During its closest approach to our fair planet in early February Comet ZTF was a mere 2.3 light-minutes distant. Then known as the green comet, this visitor from the remote Oort Cloud is now nearly 13.3 light-minutes away. In this deep image, composed of exposures captured on March 21, the comet still sports a broad, whitish dust tail and greenish tinted coma though. Not far on the sky from Orion's bright star Rigel, Comet ZTF shares the field of view with faint, dusty nebulae and distant background galaxies. The telephoto frame is crowded with Milky Way stars toward the constellation Eridanus. The influence of Jupiter's gravity on the comet's orbit as ZTF headed for the inner solar system, may have set the comet on an outbound journey, never to return.","comet, former, darling, northern, c/2022e3, faded, closest, approach, fair, planet, early, february, light-minutes, distant, known, green, visitor, remote, oort, cloud, deep, image, composed, exposure, captured, sport, broad, whitish, dust, tail, greenish, tinted, coma, orion, bright, star, rigel, share, field, view, faint, dusty, nebula, background, galaxy, telephoto, frame, crowded, milky, constellation, eridanus, influence, jupiter, gravity, orbit, headed, solar, system, journey, return"
Venus and the Da Vinci Glow,"On March 23 early evening skygazers could watch Venus and a young crescent moon, both near the western horizon. On that date Earth's brilliant evening star, faint lunar night side and slender sunlit crescent were captured in this telephoto skyscape posing alongside a church tower from San Pietro di Cadore, Dolomiti, Italy. Of course the subtle lunar illumination is earthshine, earthlight reflected from the Moon's night side. A description of earthshine, in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface, was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci. On March 24, from some locations the Moon could be seen to occult or pass in front of Venus.

Wanderers,"How far out will humanity explore? If this video's fusion of real space imagery and fictional space visualizations is on the right track, then at least the Solar System. Some of the video's wondrous sequences depict future humans drifting through the rings of Saturn, exploring Jupiter from a nearby spacecraft, and jumping off a high cliff in the low gravity of a moon of Uranus. Although no one can know the future, wandering and exploring beyond boundaries -- both physical and intellectual -- is part of the human spirit and has frequently served humanity well in the past.","wanderer, humanity, explore, video, fusion, real, space, imagery, fictional, visualization, track, least, solar, system, wondrous, sequence, depict, future, human, drifting, ring, saturn, exploring, jupiter, spacecraft, jumping, high, cliff, gravity, moon, know, wandering, boundary, physical, intellectual, part, spirit, served"
Aurora Over Arctic Henge,"Reports of powerful solar flares started a seven-hour quest north to capture modern monuments against an aurora-filled sky.  The peaks of iconic Arctic Henge in Raufarhöfn in northern Iceland were already aligned with the stars: some are lined up toward the exact north from one side and toward exact south from the other. The featured image, taken after sunset late last month, looks directly south, but since the composite image covers so much of the sky, the north star Polaris is actually visible at the very top of the frame. Also visible are familiar constellations including the Great Bear (Ursa Major) on the left, and the Hunter (Orion) on the lower right. The quest was successful.  The sky lit up dramatically with bright and memorable auroras that shimmered with amazing colors including red, pink, yellow, and green -- sometimes several at once.","arctic, henge, report, powerful, solar, flare, started, seven-hour, quest, north, capture, modern, monument, aurora-filled, peak, iconic, raufarhöfn, northern, iceland, aligned, star, lined, exact, side, south, featured, image, taken, sunset, late, last, month, look, composite, much, polaris, visible, frame, familiar, constellation, including, great, bear, ursa, major, left, hunter, orion, lower, right, successful, bright, memorable, aurora, shimmered, amazing, color, pink, yellow, green, several"
A Multiple Green Flash Sunset,"Yes, but can your green flash do this? A green flash at sunset is a rare event that many Sun watchers pride themselves on having seen.  Once thought to be a myth, a green flash is now understood to occur when the Earth's atmosphere acts like both a prism and a lens. Different atmospheric layers create altitude-variable refraction that takes light from the top of the Sun and disperses its colors, creates two images, and magnifies it in just the right way to make a thin sliver appear green just before it disappears. Pictured, though, is an even more unusual sunset. From the high-altitude Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile one day last April, the Sun was captured setting beyond an atmosphere with multiple distinct thermal layers, creating several  mock images of the Sun.  This time and from this location, many of those layers produced a green flash simultaneously. Just seconds after this multiple-green-flash event was caught by two well-surprised astrophotographers, the Sun set below the clouds.","multiple, green, flash, sunset, rare, event, many, watcher, pride, seen, thought, myth, understood, occur, earth, atmosphere, prism, different, atmospheric, layer, create, altitude-variable, refraction, take, light, disperses, color, creates, image, magnifies, right, make, thin, sliver, appear, disappears, pictured, unusual, high-altitude, cerro, inter-american, observatory, chile, last, april, captured, setting, distinct, thermal, creating, several, mock, time, location, produced, second, multiple-green-flash, caught, well-surprised, astrophotographers, cloud"
Sh2-308: A Dolphin Shaped Star Bubble,"Which star created this bubble? It wasn't the bright star on the bubble's right. And it also wasn't a giant space dolphin. It was the star in the blue nebula's center, a famously energetic Wolf-Rayet star. Wolf-Rayet stars in general have over 20 times the mass of our Sun and expel fast particle winds that can create iconic looking nebulas. In this case, the resulting star bubble spans over 60 light years, is about 70,000 years old, and happens to look like the head of a dolphin.  Named Sh2-308 and dubbed the Dolphin-Head Nebula, the gas ball lies about 5,000 light years away and covers as much sky as the full moon -- although it is much dimmer. The nearby red-tinged clouds on the left of the featured image may owe their glow and shape to energetic light emitted from the same Wolf-Rayet star.","sh2-308, dolphin, shaped, star, bubble, created, bright, right, giant, space, blue, nebula, center, energetic, wolf-rayet, general, time, mass, expel, fast, particle, wind, create, iconic, looking, case, resulting, span, light, year, happens, look, head, named, dubbed, dolphin-head, ball, much, full, moon, dimmer, nearby, red-tinged, cloud, left, featured, image, glow, shape, emitted"
NGC 4372 and the Dark Doodad,"The delightful Dark Doodad Nebula drifts through southern skies, a tantalizing target for binoculars toward the small constellation Musca, The Fly. The dusty cosmic cloud is seen against rich starfields just south of the Coalsack Nebula and the Southern Cross. Stretching for about 3 degrees across the center of this telephoto field of view, the Dark Doodad is punctuated near its southern tip (upper right) by yellowish globular star cluster NGC 4372. Of course NGC 4372 roams the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy, a background object some 20,000 light-years away and only by chance along our line-of-sight to the Dark Doodad. The Dark Doodad's well defined silhouette belongs to the Musca molecular cloud, but its better known alliterative moniker was first coined by astro-imager and writer Dennis di Cicco in 1986 while observing Comet Halley from the Australian outback.

Seeing Titan,"Shrouded in a thick atmosphere, Saturn's largest moon Titan really is hard to see. Small particles suspended in the upper atmosphere cause an almost impenetrable haze, strongly scattering light at visible wavelengths and hiding Titan's surface features from prying eyes. But Titan's surface is better imaged at infrared wavelengths where scattering is weaker and atmospheric absorption is reduced. Arrayed around this visible light image (center) of Titan are some of the clearest global infrared views of the tantalizing moon so far. In false color, the six panels present a consistent processing of 13 years of infrared image data from the Visual and Infrared Mapping Spectrometer (VIMS) on board the Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn from 2004 to 2017. They offer a stunning comparison with Cassini's visible light view. NASA's revolutionary rotorcraft mission to Titan is due to launch in 2027.","seeing, titan, shrouded, thick, saturn, largest, moon, hard, small, particle, suspended, atmosphere, cause, impenetrable, haze, scattering, light, visible, wavelength, hiding, surface, feature, prying, imaged, infrared, weaker, atmospheric, absorption, reduced, arrayed, image, center, clearest, global, view, tantalizing, false, color, panel, present, consistent, processing, year, data, visual, mapping, spectrometer, board, cassini, spacecraft, orbiting, offer, stunning, comparison, nasa, revolutionary, rotorcraft, mission, launch"
NGC 2442: Galaxy in Volans,"Distorted galaxy NGC 2442 can be found in the southern constellation of the flying fish, (Piscis) Volans. Located about 50 million light-years away, the galaxy's two spiral arms extending from a pronounced central bar give it a hook-shaped appearance in this deep colorful image, with spiky foreground stars scattered across the telescopic field of view. The image also reveals the distant galaxy's obscuring dust lanes, young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions surrounding a core of yellowish light from an older population of stars. But the star forming regions seem more concentrated along the drawn-out (upper right) spiral arm. The distorted structure is likely the result of an ancient close encounter with the smaller galaxy seen near the top left of the frame. The two interacting galaxies are separated by about 150,000 light-years at the estimated distance of NGC 2442.","galaxy, volans, distorted, found, southern, constellation, flying, fish, piscis, located, light-year, spiral, extending, pronounced, central, give, hook-shaped, appearance, deep, colorful, image, spiky, foreground, star, scattered, telescopic, field, view, reveals, distant, obscuring, dust, lane, young, blue, cluster, reddish, forming, region, surrounding, core, yellowish, light, older, population, seem, concentrated, drawn-out, upper, right, structure, likely, result, ancient, smaller, seen, left, frame, interacting, separated, estimated, distance"
M57: The Ring Nebula from Hubble,"It was noticed hundreds of years ago by stargazers who could not understand its unusual shape.  It looked like a ring on the sky. Except for the rings of Saturn, the Ring Nebula (M57) may be the most famous celestial circle. We now know what it is, and that its iconic shape is due to our lucky perspective. The recent mapping of the expanding nebula's 3-D structure, based in part on this clear Hubble image,indicates that the nebula is a relatively dense, donut-like ring wrapped around the middle of an (American) football-shaped cloud of glowing gas. Our view from planet Earth looks down the long axis of the football, face-on to the ring. Of course, in this well-studied example of a planetary nebula, the glowing material does not come from planets. Instead, the gaseous shroud represents outer layers expelled from the dying, once sun-like star, now a tiny pinprick of light seen at the nebula's center. Intense ultraviolet light from the hot central star ionizes atoms in the gas. The Ring Nebula is about one light-year across and 2,500 light-years away.","ring, hubble, noticed, year, stargazer, understand, unusual, shape, looked, saturn, nebula, famous, celestial, circle, know, iconic, perspective, recent, mapping, expanding, structure, based, part, clear, image, indicates, dense, donut-like, wrapped, middle, american, football-shaped, cloud, glowing, view, planet, earth, look, long, axis, football, face-on, course, well-studied, example, planetary, material, come, gaseous, shroud, represents, outer, layer, expelled, dying, sun-like, star, tiny, pinprick, light, seen, center, intense, ultraviolet, central, ionizes, light-year"
The Galactic Center Radio Arc,What causes this unusual curving structure near the center of our Galaxy? The long parallel rays slanting across the top of the featured radio image are known collectively as the Galactic Center Radio Arc and point out from the Galactic plane.  The Radio Arc is connected to the Galactic Center by strange curving filaments known as the Arches.  The bright radio structure at the bottom right surrounds a black hole at the Galactic Center and is known as Sagittarius A*.  One origin hypothesis holds that the Radio Arc and the Arches have their geometry because they contain hot plasma flowing along lines of a constant magnetic field.

Olympus Mons: Largest Volcano in the Solar System,"The largest volcano in our Solar System is on Mars.  Although three times higher than Earth's Mount Everest, Olympus Mons will not be difficult for humans to climb because of the volcano's shallow slopes and Mars' low gravity.  Covering an area greater than the entire Hawaiian volcano chain, the slopes of Olympus Mons typically rise only a few degrees at a time.  Olympus Mons is an immense shield volcano, built long ago by fluid lava.  A relatively static surface crust allowed it to build up over time. Its last eruption is thought to have been about 25 million years ago.

Rubin's Galaxy,"In this Hubble Space Telescope image the bright, spiky stars lie in the foreground toward the heroic northern constellation Perseus and well within our own Milky Way galaxy. In sharp focus beyond is UGC 2885, a giant spiral galaxy about 232 million light-years distant. Some 800,000 light-years across compared to the Milky Way's diameter of 100,000 light-years or so, it has around 1 trillion stars. That's about 10 times as many stars as the Milky Way. Part of an investigation to understand how galaxies can grow to such enormous sizes, UGC 2885 was also part of An Interesting Voyage and astronomer Vera Rubin's pioneering study of the rotation of spiral galaxies.

Terran 1 Burns Methalox,"Relativity's Terran 1 Rocket is mostly 3D-printed. It burns a cryogenic rocket fuel composed of liquid methane and liquid oxygen (methalox). In this close-up of a Terran 1 launch on the night of March 22 from Cape Canaveral, icy chunks fall through the stunning frame as intense blue exhaust streams from its nine Aeon 1 engines. In a largely successful flight the inovative rocket achieved main engine cutoff and stage separation but fell short of orbit after an anomaly at the beginning of its second stage flight. Of course this Terran 1 rocket was never intended to travel to Mars. Still, the methane and liquid oxygen components of its methalox fuel can be made solely from materials found on the Red Planet.

Rigel Wide,"Brilliant, blue, supergiant star Rigel marks the foot of Orion the Hunter in planet Earth's night. Designated Beta Orionis, it's at the center of this remarkably deep and wide field of view.  Rigel's blue color indicates that it is much hotter than its rival supergiant in Orion the yellowish Betelgeuse (Alpha Orionis), though both stars are massive enough to eventually end their days as core collapse supernovae. Some 860 light-years away, Rigel is hotter than the Sun too and extends to about 74 times the solar radius. That's about the size of the orbit of Mercury. In the 10 degree wide frame toward the nebula rich constellation, the Orion Nebula is at the upper left.

M100: A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy,"Majestic on a truly cosmic scale, M100 is appropriately known as a grand design spiral galaxy.  It is a large galaxy of over 100 billion stars with well-defined spiral arms that is similar to our own Milky Way Galaxy.  One of the brightest members of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, M100 (alias NGC 4321) is 56 million light-years distant toward the constellation of Berenice's Hair (Coma Berenices).  This Hubble Space Telescope image of M100 was taken with the Wide Field Camera 3 and accentuates bright blue star clusters and intricate winding dust lanes which are hallmarks of this class of galaxies.

The Egg Nebula in Polarized Light,"Where is the center of the Egg Nebula? Emerging from a cosmic egg, the star in the center of the Egg Nebula is casting away shells of gas and dust as it slowly transforms itself into a white dwarf star.  The Egg Nebula is a rapidly evolving pre- planetary nebula spanning about one light year. It lies some 3,000 light-years away toward the northern constellation Cygnus. Thick dust blocks the center star from view, while the dust shells farther out reflect light from this star.  Light vibrating in the plane defined by each dust grain, the central star, and the observer is preferentially reflected, causing an effect known as polarization.  Measuring the orientation of the polarized light for the Egg Nebula gives clues to location of the hidden source.  Taken by Hubble's Advanced Camera for Surveys in 2002, this image is rendered in artificial ""Easter-Egg"" colors coded to highlight the orientation of polarization.","polarized, light, center, emerging, cosmic, star, casting, shell, dust, transforms, white, dwarf, evolving, pre-, planetary, nebula, spanning, year, light-year, northern, constellation, cygnus, thick, block, view, reflect, vibrating, plane, defined, grain, central, reflected, causing, effect, known, polarization, measuring, orientation, give, clue, location, hidden, source, taken, hubble, advanced, camera, survey, image, rendered, artificial, easter-egg, color, coded, highlight"
IC 2944: The Running Chicken Nebula,"To some, it looks like a giant chicken running across the sky. To others, it looks like a gaseous nebula where star formation takes place. Cataloged as IC 2944, the Running Chicken Nebula spans about 100 light years and lies about 6,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Centaur (Centaurus).  The featured image, shown in scientifically assigned colors, was captured recently in a 16-hour exposure over three nights.

North Star: Polaris and Surrounding Dust,"Why is Polaris called the North Star? First, Polaris is the nearest bright star toward the north spin axis of the Earth.  Therefore, as the Earth turns, stars appear to revolve around Polaris, but Polaris itself always stays in the same northerly direction -- making it the North Star.  Since no bright star is near the south spin axis of the Earth, there is currently no bright South Star.  Thousands of years ago, Earth's spin axis pointed in a slightly different direction so that Vega was the North Star.  Although Polaris is not the brightest star on the sky, it is easily located because it is nearly aligned with two stars in the cup of the Big Dipper. Polaris is near the center of the eight-degree wide featured image, a digital composite of hundreds of exposures that brings out faint gas and dust of the Integrated Flux Nebula (IFN) all over the frame as well as the globular star cluster NGC 188 on the far left.  The surface of Cepheid Polaris slowly pulsates, causing the famous star to change its brightness by a few percent over the course of a few days.

NGC 206 and the Star Clouds of Andromeda,"The large stellar association cataloged as NGC 206 is nestled within the dusty arms of the neighboring Andromeda galaxy along with the galaxy's pinkish star-forming regions. Also known as M31, the spiral galaxy is a mere 2.5 million light-years away. NGC 206 is found right of center in this sharp and detailed close-up of the southwestern extent of Andromeda's disk. The bright, blue stars of NGC 206 indicate its youth. In fact, its youngest massive stars are less than 10 million years old. Much larger than the open or galactic clusters of young stars in the disk of our Milky Way galaxy, NGC 206 spans about 4,000 light-years. That's comparable in size to the giant stellar nurseries NGC 604 in nearby spiral M33 and the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud.","star, cloud, andromeda, large, stellar, association, cataloged, nestled, dusty, neighboring, galaxy, pinkish, star-forming, region, known, spiral, light-year, found, center, sharp, detailed, close-up, southwestern, extent, disk, bright, blue, indicate, youth, fact, youngest, massive, year, much, larger, open, galactic, cluster, young, milky, span, comparable, size, giant, nursery, nearby, tarantula, magellanic"
NGC 2419: Intergalactic Wanderer,"Stars of the globular cluster NGC 2419 are packed into this Hubble Space Telescope field of view toward the mostly stealthy constellation Lynx. The two brighter spiky stars near the edge of the frame are within our own galaxy. NGC 2419 itself is remote though, some 300,000 light-years away. In comparison, the Milky Way's satellite galaxy, the Large Magellanic Cloud, is only about 160,000 light-years distant. Roughly similar to other large globular star clusters like Omega Centauri, NGC 2419 is intrinsically bright, but appears faint because it is so far away. Its extreme distance makes it difficult to study and compare its properties with other globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Sometimes called ""the Intergalactic Wanderer"", NGC 2419 really does seem to have come from beyond the Milky Way. Measurements of the cluster's motion through space suggest it once belonged to the Sagittarius dwarf spheroidal galaxy, another small satellite galaxy being disrupted by repeated encounters with the much larger Milky Way.","intergalactic, wanderer, star, globular, cluster, packed, hubble, space, telescope, field, view, stealthy, constellation, lynx, brighter, spiky, edge, frame, galaxy, remote, light-year, comparison, milky, satellite, large, magellanic, cloud, distant, similar, omega, centauri, bright, appears, faint, extreme, distance, make, difficult, study, compare, property, roam, halo, called, seem, come, measurement, motion, suggest, belonged, sagittarius, dwarf, spheroidal, small, disrupted, repeated, much, larger"
Portrait of NGC 3628,"Sharp telescopic views of NGC 3628 show a puffy galactic disk divided by dark dust lanes. Of course, this portrait of the magnificent, edge-on spiral galaxy puts some astronomers in mind of its popular moniker, the Hamburger Galaxy. It also reveals a small galaxy nearby (below), likely a satellite of NGC 3628, and a very faint but extensive tidal tail. The drawn out tail stretches for about 300,000 light-years, even beyond the left edge of the frame. NGC 3628 shares its neighborhood in the local universe with two other large spirals M65 and M66 in a grouping otherwise known as the Leo Triplet. Gravitational interactions with its cosmic neighbors are likely responsible for creating the tidal tail, as well as the extended flare and warp of this spiral's disk. The tantalizing island universe itself is about 100,000 light-years across and 35 million light-years away in the northern springtime constellation Leo.","portrait, sharp, telescopic, view, show, puffy, galactic, disk, divided, dark, dust, lane, course, magnificent, edge-on, spiral, galaxy, mind, popular, moniker, hamburger, reveals, small, likely, satellite, faint, extensive, tidal, tail, drawn, stretch, light-year, left, edge, frame, share, neighborhood, local, universe, large, grouping, known, triplet, gravitational, interaction, cosmic, neighbor, responsible, creating, extended, flare, warp, tantalizing, island, northern, springtime, constellation"
When Z is for Mars,"A composite of images captured about a week apart from mid August 2022 through late March 2023, this series traces the retrograde motion of ruddy-colored Mars. Progressing from lower right to upper left Mars makes a Z-shaped path as it wanders past the Pleiades and Hyades star clusters, through the constellation Taurus in planet Earth's night sky. Seen about every two years, Mars doesn't actually reverse the direction of its orbit to trace out the Z-shape though. Instead, the apparent backwards or retrograde motion with respect to the background stars is a reflection of the orbital motion of Earth itself. Retrograde motion can be seen each time Earth overtakes and laps planets orbiting farther from the Sun, the Earth moving more rapidly through its own relatively close-in orbit.  High in northern hemisphere skies the Red Planet was opposite the Sun and at its closest and brightest on December 8, near the center of the frame. Seen close to Mars, a popular visitor to the inner Solar System, comet ZTF (C/2022 E3), was also captured on two dates, February 10 and February 16.","composite, image, captured, week, august, late, march, series, trace, retrograde, motion, ruddy-colored, progressing, lower, right, upper, left, make, z-shaped, path, wanders, past, pleiades, hyades, star, cluster, constellation, taurus, planet, earth, night, seen, year, reverse, direction, z-shape, apparent, backwards, respect, reflection, orbital, time, overtakes, orbiting, moving, close-in, orbit, high, northern, closest, brightest, december, center, frame, popular, visitor, inner, solar, system, comet, c/2022, date, february"
M2-9: Wings of a Butterfly Nebula,"Are stars better appreciated for their art after they die?  Actually, stars usually create their most artistic displays as they die.  In the case of low-mass stars like our Sun and M2-9 pictured here, the stars transform themselves from normal stars to white dwarfs by casting off their outer gaseous envelopes.  The expended gas frequently forms an impressive display called a planetary nebula that fades gradually over thousands of years.  M2-9, a butterfly planetary nebula 2100 light-years away shown in representative colors, has wings that tell a strange but incomplete tale.  In the center, two stars orbit inside a gaseous disk 10 times the orbit of Pluto.  The expelled envelope of the dying star breaks out from the disk creating the bipolar appearance.  Much remains unknown about the physical processes that cause and shape planetary nebulae.","m2-9, wing, butterfly, star, appreciated, create, artistic, display, case, low-mass, pictured, transform, normal, white, dwarf, casting, gaseous, envelope, expended, impressive, called, planetary, nebula, fade, year, light-year, shown, representative, color, tell, strange, incomplete, tale, center, orbit, disk, time, pluto, expelled, dying, break, creating, bipolar, appearance, much, remains, unknown, physical, process, cause, shape"
ELVES Lightning over Italy,"What's that red ring in the sky? Lightning. The most commonly seen type of lightning involves flashes of bright white light between clouds. Over the past 50 years, though, other types of upper-atmospheric lightning have been confirmed, including red sprites and blue jets. Less well known and harder to photograph is a different type of upper atmospheric lightning known as ELVES. ELVES are thought to be created when an electromagnetic pulse shoots upward from charged clouds and impacts the ionosphere, causing nitrogen molecules to glow.  The red ELVES ring pictured had a radius of about 350 km and was captured in late March about 100 kilometers above Ancona, Italy. Years of experience and ultra-fast photography were used to capture this ELVES -- which lasted only about 0.001 second.","lightning, italy, ring, seen, type, involves, flash, bright, white, light, cloud, year, upper-atmospheric, confirmed, including, sprite, blue, less, known, harder, photograph, different, upper, atmospheric, thought, created, electromagnetic, pulse, shoot, charged, impact, causing, nitrogen, molecule, glow, pictured, radius, captured, late, march, kilometer, ancona, experience, ultra-fast, photography, used, capture, lasted, second"
Map of Total Solar Eclipse Path in 2024 April,"Would you like to see a total eclipse of the Sun?  If so, do any friends or relatives live near the path of next April's eclipse?  If yes again, then you might want to arrange a well-timed visit. Next April 8, the path of a total solar eclipse will cross North America from western Mexico to eastern Canada, entering the USA in southern Texas and exiting in northern Maine.  All of North America will experience the least a partial solar eclipse.  Featured here is a map of the path of totality.  Many people who have seen a total solar eclipse tell stories about it for the rest of their lives.

Auroral Storm over Lapland,"On some nights the sky is the best show in town.  On this night, auroras ruled the sky, and the geomagnetic storm that created this colorful sky show originated from an increasingly active Sun. Surprisingly, since the approaching solar CME the day before had missed the Earth, it was not expected that this storm would create auroras. In the foreground, two happily surprised aurora hunters contemplate the amazing and rapidly changing sky. Regardless of forecasts, though, auroras were reported in the night skies of Earth not only in the far north, but as far south as New Mexico, USA.  As captured in a wide-angle image above Saariselkä in northern Finnish Lapland, a bright aurora was visible with an unusually high degree of detail, range of colors, and breadth across the sky.  The vivid yellow, green, red and purple auroral colors are caused by oxygen and nitrogen atoms high in Earth's atmosphere reacting to incoming electrons.

The Dark Seahorse in Cepheus,"Spanning light-years, this suggestive shape known as the Seahorse Nebula appears in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars. Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, obscuring clouds are part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within, but their collapsing cores are only visible at long infrared wavelengths.

Solar Eclipse from Western Australia,"Along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the shadow of the New Moon raced across planet Earth's southern hemisphere on April 20 to create a rare annular-total or hybrid solar eclipse. A mere 62 seconds of totality could be seen though, when the dark central lunar shadow just grazed the North West Cape, a peninsula in western Australia. From top to bottom these panels capture the beginning, middle, and end of that fleeting total eclipse phase. At start and finish, solar prominences and beads of sunlight stream past the lunar limb. At mid-eclipse the central frame reveals the sight only easily visible during totality and most treasured by eclipse chasers, the magnificent corona of the active Sun. Of course eclipses tend to come in pairs. On May 5, the next Full Moon will just miss the dark inner part of Earth's shadow in a penumbral lunar eclipse.

NGC 1333: Stellar Nursery in Perseus,"In visible light NGC 1333 is seen as a reflection nebula, dominated by bluish hues characteristic of starlight reflected by interstellar dust. A mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation Perseus, it lies at the edge of a large, star-forming molecular cloud. This Hubble Space Telescope close-up frames a region just over 1 light-year wide at the estimated distance of NGC 1333. It shows details of the dusty region along with telltale hints of contrasty red emission from Herbig-Haro objects, jets and shocked glowing gas emanating from recently formed stars. In fact, NGC 1333 contains hundreds of stars less than a million years old, most still hidden from optical telescopes by the pervasive stardust. The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago.

A Waterspout in Florida,"What's happening over the water?  Pictured here is one of the better images yet recorded of a waterspout, a type of tornado that occurs over water.  Waterspouts are spinning columns of rising moist air that typically form over warm water. Waterspouts can be as dangerous as tornadoes and can feature wind speeds over 200 kilometers per hour.  Some waterspouts form away from thunderstorms and even during relatively fair weather.  Waterspouts may be relatively transparent and initially visible only by an unusual pattern they create on the water.  The featured image was taken in 2013 July near Tampa Bay, Florida. The Atlantic Ocean off the coast of Florida is arguably the most active area in the world for waterspouts, with hundreds forming each year.

The Medulla Nebula Supernova Remnant,"What powers this unusual nebula? CTB-1 is the expanding gas shell that was left when a massive star toward the constellation of Cassiopeia exploded about 10,000 years ago. The star likely detonated when it ran out of elements near its core that could create stabilizing pressure with nuclear fusion. The resulting supernova remnant, nicknamed the Medulla Nebula for its brain-like shape, still glows in visible light by the heat generated by its collision with confining interstellar gas.  Why the nebula also glows in X-ray light, though, remains a mystery. One hypothesis holds that an energetic pulsar was co-created that powers the nebula with a fast outwardly moving wind. Following this lead, a pulsar has recently been found in radio waves that appears to have been expelled by the supernova explosion at over 1000 kilometers per second.  Although the Medulla Nebula appears as large as a full moon, it is so faint that it took many hours of exposure with a telescope in Seven Persons, Alberta, Canada to create the featured image.","medulla, nebula, supernova, remnant, power, unusual, ctb-1, expanding, shell, left, massive, star, constellation, cassiopeia, exploded, year, detonated, element, core, create, stabilizing, pressure, nuclear, fusion, resulting, nicknamed, brain-like, shape, glow, visible, light, heat, generated, collision, confining, interstellar, x-ray, remains, mystery, hypothesis, hold, energetic, pulsar, co-created, moving, wind, following, lead, found, radio, wave, appears, expelled, explosion, kilometer, second, large, full, moon, faint, took, many, hour, exposure, telescope, person, canada, featured, image"
Northern Lights over Southern Europe,"Did you see an aurora over the past two nights? Many people who don't live in Earth's far north did.  Reports of aurora came in not only from northern locales in the USA as Alaska, but as far south as Texas and Arizona. A huge auroral oval extended over Europe and Asia, too. Pictured, an impressively red aurora was captured last night near the town of Cáceres in central Spain. Auroras were also reported in parts of southern Spain. The auroras resulted from a strong Coronal Mass Event (CME) that occurred on the Sun a few days ago. Particles from the CME crossed the inner Solar System before colliding with the Earth's magnetosphere.  From there, electrons and protons spiraled down the Earth's northern magnetic field lines and collided with oxygen and nitrogen in Earth's atmosphere, causing picturesque auroral glows. Our unusually active Sun may provide future opportunities to see the northern lights in southern skies.","northern, light, southern, europe, past, night, many, people, live, earth, north, report, aurora, came, locale, alaska, texas, arizona, huge, auroral, oval, extended, asia, pictured, captured, last, town, cáceres, central, spain, reported, part, resulted, strong, coronal, mass, event, occurred, particle, crossed, inner, solar, system, colliding, magnetosphere, proton, spiraled, magnetic, field, line, collided, oxygen, nitrogen, atmosphere, causing, picturesque, glow, active, provide, future, opportunity"
The Moon through the Arc de Triomphe,"Was this a lucky shot? Although many amazing photographs are taken by someone who just happened to be in the right place at the right time, this image took skill and careful planning. First was the angular scale: if you shoot too close to the famous Arc de Triomphe in  Paris, France, the full moon will appear too small.  Conversely, if you shoot from too far away, the moon will appear  too large and not fit inside the Arc. Second is timing: the Moon only appears centered inside the Arc for small periods of time -- from this distance less than a minute. Other planned features include lighting, relative brightness, height, capturing a good foreground, and digital processing.  And yes, there is some luck involved -- for example, the sky must be clear. This time, the planning was successful, bringing two of humanity's most famous icons photographically together for all to enjoy.

The Tarantula Nebula from SuperBIT,"The Tarantula Nebula, also known as 30 Doradus, is more than a thousand light-years in diameter, a giant star forming region within nearby satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. About 160 thousand light-years away, it's the largest, most violent star forming region known in the whole Local Group of galaxies. The cosmic arachnid is near the center of this spectacular image taken during the flight of SuperBIT (Super Pressure Balloon Imaging Telescope), NASA's balloon-borne 0.5 meter telescope now floating near the edge of space. Within the well-studied Tarantula (NGC 2070), intense radiation, stellar winds and supernova shocks from the central young cluster of massive stars, cataloged as R136, energize the nebular glow and shape the spidery filaments. Around the Tarantula are other star forming regions with young star clusters, filaments, and blown-out bubble-shaped clouds.

Runaway Star Alpha Camelopardalis,"Like a ship plowing through cosmic seas, runaway star Alpha Camelopardalis has produced this graceful arcing bow wave or bow shock. The massive supergiant star moves at over 60 kilometers per second through space, compressing the interstellar material in its path. At the center of this nearly 6 degree wide view, Alpha Cam is about 25-30 times as massive as the Sun, 5 times hotter (30,000 kelvins), and over 500,000 times brighter. About 4,000 light-years away in the long-necked constellation Camelopardalis, the star also produces a strong stellar wind. Alpha Cam's bow shock stands off about 10 light-years from the star itself. What set this star in motion? Astronomers have long thought that Alpha Cam was flung out of a nearby cluster of young hot stars due to gravitational interactions with other cluster members or perhaps by the supernova explosion of a massive companion star.","star, alpha, camelopardalis, ship, plowing, cosmic, runaway, produced, graceful, arcing, wave, shock, massive, supergiant, move, kilometer, second, space, compressing, interstellar, material, path, center, degree, wide, view, 25-30, time, hotter, kelvin, brighter, light-year, long-necked, constellation, produce, strong, stellar, wind, stand, motion, astronomer, thought, flung, cluster, young, gravitational, interaction, member, supernova, explosion, companion"
Solar Eclipse from a Ship,"Along a narrow path that mostly avoided landfall, the shadow of the New Moon raced across planet Earth's southern hemisphere on April 20 to create a rare annular-total or hybrid solar eclipse. From the Indian Ocean off the coast of western Australia, ship-borne eclipse chasers were able to witness 62 seconds of totality though while anchored near the centerline of the total eclipse track. This ship-borne image of the eclipse captures the active Sun's magnificent outer atmosphere or solar corona streaming into space. A composite of 11 exposures ranging from 1/2000 to 1/2 second, it records an extended range of brightness to follow details of the corona not quite visible to the eye during the total eclipse phase.

Saturn's Moon Helene in Color,"Although its colors may be subtle, Saturn's moon Helene is an enigma in any light. The moon was imaged in unprecedented detail in 2012 as the robotic Cassini spacecraft orbiting Saturn swooped to within a single Earth diameter of the diminutive moon. Although conventional craters and hills appear, the above image also shows terrain that appears unusually smooth and streaked. Planetary astronomers are inspecting these detailed images of Helene to glean clues about the origin and evolution of the 30-km across floating iceberg. Helene is also unusual because it circles Saturn just ahead of the large moon Dione, making it one of only four known Saturnian moons to occupy a gravitational dimple known as a stable Lagrange point.","saturn, moon, helene, color, subtle, enigma, light, imaged, unprecedented, detail, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, orbiting, swooped, single, earth, diminutive, conventional, crater, hill, appear, image, show, terrain, appears, smooth, streaked, planetary, astronomer, inspecting, detailed, glean, clue, origin, evolution, 30-km, floating, iceberg, unusual, circle, large, dione, making, known, saturnian, gravitational, dimple, stable, lagrange, point"
Carina Nebula North,"The Great Carina Nebula is home to strange stars and iconic nebulas. Named for its home constellation, the huge star-forming region is larger and brighter than the Great Orion Nebula but less well known because it is so far south -- and because so much of humanity lives so far north.  The featured image shows in great detail the northernmost part of the Carina Nebula. On the bottom left is the Gabriela Mistral Nebula consisting of an emission nebula of glowing gas (IC 2599) surrounding the small open cluster of stars (NGC 3324).

Flat Rock Hills on Mars,"Why are there so many flat rocks on Mars? Some views of plains and hills on Mars show many rocks that are unusually flat when compared to rocks on Earth. One reason for this is a process that is common to both Mars and Earth: erosion. The carbon-dioxide wind on Mars can act like sandpaper when it blows around gritty Martian sand. This sand can create differential erosion, smoothing over some rocks, while wearing down the tops of other long-exposed stones.  The featured image capturing several hills covered with flat-topped rocks was taken last month by NASA's  Curiosity Rover on Mars. This robotic rover has now been rolling across Mars for ten years and has helped uncover many details of the wet and windy past of Earth's planetary neighbor.

Centaurus A: A Peculiar Island of Stars,"Galaxies are fascinating. In galaxies, gravity alone holds together massive collections of stars, dust, interstellar gas, stellar remnants and dark matter.  Pictured is NGC 5128, better known as Centaurus A.  Cen A is the fifth brightest galaxy on the sky and is located at a distance of about 12 million light years from Earth. The warped shape of Cen A is the result of a merger between an elliptical and a spiral galaxy.  Its active galactic nucleus harbors a supermassive black hole that is about 55 million times more massive than our Sun.  This central black hole ejects a fast  jet visible in both radio and X-ray light. Filaments of the jet are visible in red in the upper left.  New observations by the Event Horizon Telescope have revealed a brightening of the jet only towards its edges -- but for reasons that are currently unknown and an active topic of research.

"The Galaxy, the Jet, and a Famous Black Hole","Bright elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87) is home to the supermassive black hole captured in 2017 by planet Earth's Event Horizon Telescope in the first ever image of a black hole. Giant of the Virgo galaxy cluster about 55 million light-years away, M87 is the large galaxy rendered in blue hues in this infrared image from the Spitzer Space telescope.  Though M87 appears mostly featureless and cloud-like, the Spitzer image does record details of relativistic jets blasting from the galaxy's central region. Shown in the inset at top right, the jets themselves span thousands of light-years. The brighter jet seen on the right is approaching and close to our line of sight.

Shackleton from ShadowCam,"Shackleton crater lies at the lunar south pole. Peaks along the rim of the 21 kilometer diameter crater are in sunlight, but Shackleton's floor is in dark permanent shadow. Still, this image of the shadowed rim wall and floor of Shackleton crater was captured from NASA's ShadowCam, an instrument on board the Korea Pathfinder Lunar Orbiter (KPLO) launched in August 2022. About 200 times more sensitive than, for example, the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter's Narrow Angle Camera, ShadowCam was designed to image the permanently shadowed regions of the lunar surface. Avoiding direct sunlight, those regions are expected to be reservoirs of water-ice and other volatiles deposited by ancient cometary impacts and useful to future Moon missions. Of course, the permanently shadowed regions are still illuminated by reflections of sunlight from nearby lunar terrain. In this stunningly detailed ShadowCam image, an arrow marks the track made by a single boulder rolling down Shackleton crater's wall. The image scale is indicated at the bottom of the frame.","shackleton, shadowcam, crater, lunar, south, pole, peak, kilometer, diameter, sunlight, floor, dark, permanent, shadow, image, shadowed, wall, captured, nasa, instrument, board, korea, pathfinder, orbiter, kplo, launched, time, sensitive, example, reconnaissance, narrow, angle, camera, designed, region, surface, avoiding, direct, expected, reservoir, water-ice, volatile, deposited, ancient, cometary, impact, useful, future, moon, mission, course, illuminated, reflection, terrain, detailed, arrow, mark, track, made, single, boulder, rolling, scale, indicated, bottom, frame"
Twilight in a Flower,"Transformed into the petals of a flower, 16 exposures show the passage of day into night in this creative timelapse skyscape. Start at the top and move counterclockwise to follow consecutive moments as the twilight sky turns an ever darker blue and night blossoms. Each exposure was recorded on the evening of April 22, calculated to maintain a consistent balance of light and color.  Close to the western horizon on that date, a crescent Moon and Venus are the two brightest celestial beacons. Petal to petal the pair spiral closer to the flower's center.

The Helix Nebula from CFHT,"Will our Sun look like this one day?  The Helix Nebula is one of brightest and closest examples of a planetary nebula, a gas cloud created at the end of the life of a Sun-like star. The outer gasses of the star expelled into space appear from our vantage point as if we are looking down a helix. The remnant central stellar core, destined to become a white dwarf star, glows in light so energetic it causes the previously expelled gas to fluoresce. The Helix Nebula, given a technical designation of NGC 7293, lies about 700 light-years away towards the constellation of the Water Bearer (Aquarius) and spans about 2.5 light-years. The featured picture was taken with the Canada-France-Hawaii Telescope (CFHT) located atop a dormant volcano in Hawaii, USA.

The Spanish Dancer Spiral Galaxy,"If not perfect, then this spiral galaxy is at least one of the most photogenic. An island universe containing billions of stars and situated about 40 million light-years away toward the constellation of the Dolphinfish (Dorado), NGC 1566 presents a gorgeous face-on view. Classified as a grand design spiral, NGC 1566 shows two prominent and graceful spiral arms that are traced by bright blue star clusters and dark cosmic dust lanes. Numerous Hubble Space Telescope images of NGC 1566 have been taken to study star formation, supernovas, and the spiral's unusually active center. Some of these images, stored online in the Hubble Legacy Archive, were freely downloaded, combined, and digitally processed by an industrious amateur to create the featured image. NGC 1566's flaring center makes the spiral one of the closest and brightest Seyfert galaxies, likely housing a central supermassive black hole wreaking havoc on surrounding stars and gas.

Shadows of Earth,"Can you find two Earth shadows in today's image? It's a bit tricky. To find the first shadow, observe that the top part of the atmosphere appears pink and the lower part appears blue.  This is because the top half is exposed to direct sunlight, while the lower part is not. The purple area in between is known as the Belt of Venus, even though Venus can only appear on the other side of the sky, near the Sun. The blue color of the lower atmosphere is caused by the Earth blocking sunlight, creating Earth shadow number 1. Now, where is the second Earth shadow?  Take a look at the Moon.  Do you notice something unusual about the lower left part? That area appears unusually dark because it is in the shadow of the Earth, creating Earth shadow number 2. To be precise, the Moon was captured during a  lunar eclipse.  This carefully timed image was taken in Sampieri, Sicily, Italy, in July 2018.","shadow, earth, find, today, image, tricky, first, observe, part, appears, pink, lower, blue, half, exposed, direct, sunlight, purple, area, known, belt, venus, appear, side, color, caused, blocking, creating, number, second, take, look, moon, notice, something, unusual, left, dark, precise, captured, lunar, eclipse, timed, taken, sampieri, italy, july"
Milky Way over Egyptian Desert,"For ten years the stargazer dreamed of taking a picture like this. The dreamer knew that the White Desert National Park in Egypt's Western Desert is a picturesque place hosting numerous chalk formations sculpted into surreal structures by a sandy wind. The dreamer knew that the sky above could be impressively dark on a clear moonless night, showing highlights such as the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy in impressive color and detail. So the dreamer invited an even more experienced astrophotographer to spend three weeks together in the desert and plan the composite images that needed to be taken and processed to create the dream image.  Over three days in mid-March, the base images were taken, all with the same camera and from the same location.  The impressive result is featured here, with the dreamer -- proudly wearing a traditional Bedouin galabyia -- pictured in the foreground.","milky, egyptian, desert, year, stargazer, dreamed, taking, picture, dreamer, knew, white, national, park, egypt, western, picturesque, place, hosting, numerous, chalk, formation, sculpted, surreal, structure, sandy, dark, clear, moonless, night, showing, highlight, central, band, galaxy, impressive, color, detail, invited, experienced, spend, week, plan, composite, image, needed, taken, processed, create, dream, mid-march, base, camera, location, result, featured, wearing, traditional, bedouin, galabyia, pictured, foreground"
Fomalhaut's Dusty Debris Disk,"Fomalhaut is a bright star, a 25 light-year voyage from planet Earth in the direction of the constellation Piscis Austrinus. Astronomers first noticed Fomalhaut's excess infrared emission in the 1980s. Space and ground-based telescopes have since identified the infrared emission's source as a disk of dusty debris, evidence for a planetary system surrounding the hot, young star.  But this sharp infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope's MIRI camera reveals details of Fomalhaut's debris disk never before seen, including a large dust cloud in the outer ring that is possible evidence for colliding bodies, and an inner dust disk and gap likely shaped and maintained by embedded but unseen planets. An image scale bar in au or astronomical units, the average Earth-Sun distance, appears at the lower left. Fomalhaut's outer circumstellar dust ring lies at about twice the distance of our own Solar System's Kuiper Belt of small icy bodies and debris beyond the orbit of Neptune.","fomalhaut, dusty, debris, disk, bright, star, light-year, voyage, planet, earth, direction, constellation, piscis, astronomer, noticed, excess, infrared, emission, space, ground-based, telescope, identified, source, evidence, planetary, system, surrounding, young, sharp, image, james, webb, miri, camera, reveals, detail, seen, including, large, dust, cloud, outer, ring, possible, colliding, body, inner, shaped, maintained, embedded, unseen, scale, astronomical, unit, average, earth-sun, distance, appears, lower, left, circumstellar, solar, kuiper, belt, small, orbit, neptune"
"Halley Dust, Mars Dust, and Milky Way","Grains of cosmic dust streaked through night skies in early May. Swept up as planet Earth plowed through the debris streams left behind by periodic Comet Halley, the annual meteor shower is known as the Eta Aquarids. This year, the Eta Aquarids peak was visually hampered by May's bright Full Moon, though. But early morning hours surrounding last May's shower of Halley dust were free of moonlight interference. In exposures recorded between April 28 and May 8 in 2022, this composited image shows nearly 90 Eta Aquarid meteors streaking from the shower's radiant in Aquarius over San Pedro de Atacama, Chile. The central Milky Way arcs above in the southern hemisphere's predawn skies. The faint band of light rising from the horizon is Zodiacal light, caused by dust scattering sunlight near our Solar System's ecliptic plane. Along the ecliptic and entrained in the Zodiacal glow are the bright planets Venus, Jupiter, Mars, and Saturn.  Of course Mars itself has recently been found to be a likely source of the dust along the ecliptic responsible for creating Zodiacal light.","halley, dust, milky, grain, cosmic, streaked, night, swept, planet, earth, plowed, debris, stream, left, periodic, comet, annual, meteor, shower, known, aquarids, year, peak, hampered, bright, full, moon, early, morning, hour, surrounding, last, free, moonlight, interference, exposure, recorded, composited, image, show, aquarid, streaking, radiant, aquarius, pedro, chile, central, southern, predawn, faint, band, light, rising, horizon, zodiacal, caused, scattering, sunlight, solar, system, ecliptic, plane, entrained, glow, venus, jupiter, saturn, course, found, likely, source, responsible, creating"
Apollo 17: The Crescent Earth,"Our fair planet sports a curved, sunlit crescent against the black backdrop of space in this stunning photograph. From the unfamiliar perspective, the Earth is small and, like a telescopic image of a distant planet, the entire horizon is completely within the field of view. Enjoyed by crews on board the International Space Station, only much closer views of the planet are possible from low Earth orbit. Orbiting the planet once every 90 minutes, a spectacle of clouds, oceans, and continents scrolls beneath them with the partial arc of the planet's edge in the distance. But this digitally restored image presents a view so far only achieved by 24 humans, Apollo astronauts who traveled to the Moon and back again between 1968 and 1972. The original photograph, AS17-152-23420, was taken by the homeward bound crew of Apollo 17, on December 17, 1972.

To Fly Free in Space,"What would it be like to fly free in space?  At about 100 meters from the cargo bay of the space shuttle Challenger, Bruce McCandless II was living the dream -- floating farther out than anyone had ever been before.  Guided by a Manned Maneuvering Unit (MMU), astronaut McCandless, pictured, was floating free in space.   During Space Shuttle mission 41-B in 1984,  McCandless and fellow NASA astronaut Robert Stewart were the first to experience such an ""untethered space walk"". The MMU worked by shooting jets of nitrogen and was used to help deploy and retrieve satellites.  With a mass over 140 kilograms, an MMU is heavy on Earth, but, like everything, is weightless when drifting in orbit. The MMU was later replaced with the SAFER backpack propulsion unit.","free, space, like, meter, cargo, shuttle, challenger, bruce, mccandless, living, dream, floating, anyone, guided, manned, maneuvering, unit, astronaut, pictured, mission, 41-b, fellow, robert, stewart, first, experience, untethered, walk, worked, shooting, nitrogen, used, help, deploy, retrieve, satellite, mass, kilogram, heavy, earth, everything, weightless, drifting, orbit, replaced, safer, backpack, propulsion"
M16: Eagle Nebula Deep Field,"From afar, the whole thing looks like an eagle.  A closer look at the Eagle Nebula, however, shows the bright region is actually a window into the center of a larger dark shell of dust.  Through this window, a brightly-lit workshop appears where a whole open cluster of stars is being formed.  In this cavity, tall pillars and round globules of dark dust and cold molecular gas remain where stars are still forming.  Already visible are several young bright blue stars whose light and winds are burning away and pushing back the remaining filaments and walls of gas and dust.  The Eagle emission nebula, tagged M16, lies about 6500 light years away, spans about 20 light-years, and is visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Serpent (Serpens).

Total Eclipse: The Big Corona,"Most photographs don't adequately portray the magnificence of the Sun's corona. Seeing the corona first-hand during a total solar eclipse is unparalleled.  The human eye can adapt to see coronal features and extent that average cameras usually cannot. Welcome, however, to the digital age.  The featured image digitally combined short and long exposures taken in Exmouth, Australia that were processed to highlight faint and extended features in the corona during the total solar eclipse that occurred in April of 2023.  Clearly visible are intricate layers and glowing caustics of an ever changing mixture of hot gas and magnetic fields in the Sun's corona.  Looping prominences appear bright pink just past the Sun's edge.  Images taken seconds before and after the total eclipse show glimpses of the background Sun known as Baily's Beads and diamond ring effect.

Sunspot with Light Bridge,"Why would a small part of the Sun appear slightly dark?  Visible is a close-up picture of sunspots, depressions on the Sun's surface that are slightly cooler and less bright than the rest of the Sun.  The Sun's complex magnetic field creates these cool regions by inhibiting hot material from entering the spots.  Sunspots can be larger than the Earth and typically last for about a week.  Part of active region AR 3297 crossing the Sun in early May, the large lower sunspot is spanned by an impressive light bridge of hot and suspended solar gas.  This high-resolution picture also shows clearly that the Sun's surface is a bubbling carpet of separate cells of hot gas. These cells are known as granules.  A solar granule is about 1000 kilometers across and lasts for only about 15 minutes.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

WR 134 Ring Nebula,"Made with narrowband filters, this cosmic snapshot covers a field of view about the size of the full Moon within the boundaries of the constellation Cygnus. It highlights the bright edge of a ring-like nebula traced by the glow of ionized sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen gas. Embedded in the region's interstellar clouds of gas and dust, the complex, glowing arcs are sections of bubbles or shells of material swept up by the wind from Wolf-Rayet star WR 134, brightest star near the center of the frame. Distance estimates put WR 134 about 6,000 light-years away, making the frame over 50 light-years across. Shedding their outer envelopes in powerful stellar winds, massive Wolf-Rayet stars have burned through their nuclear fuel at a prodigious rate and end this final phase of massive star evolution in a spectacular supernova explosion. The stellar winds and final supernovae enrich the interstellar material with heavy elements to be incorporated in future generations of stars.","ring, nebula, made, filter, cosmic, snapshot, cover, field, view, size, full, moon, boundary, constellation, cygnus, highlight, bright, edge, ring-like, traced, glow, ionized, sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, embedded, region, interstellar, cloud, dust, complex, glowing, section, bubble, shell, material, swept, wolf-rayet, star, brightest, center, frame, distance, estimate, light-year, making, shedding, outer, envelope, powerful, stellar, wind, massive, burned, nuclear, fuel, prodigious, rate, final, phase, evolution, spectacular, supernova, explosion, enrich, heavy, element, incorporated, future, generation"
Curly Spiral Galaxy M63,"A bright spiral galaxy of the northern sky, Messier 63 is nearby, about 30 million light-years distant toward the loyal constellation Canes Venatici. Also cataloged as NGC 5055, the majestic island universe is nearly 100,000 light-years across, about the size of our own Milky Way. Its bright core and majestic spiral arms lend the galaxy its popular name, The Sunflower Galaxy. This exceptionally deep exposure also follows faint, arcing star streams far into the galaxy's halo. Extending nearly 180,000 light-years from the galactic center, the star streams are likely remnants of tidally disrupted satellites of M63. Other satellite galaxies of M63 can be spotted in the remarkable wide-field image, including faint dwarf galaxies, which could contribute to M63's star streams in the next few billion years.","spiral, galaxy, bright, northern, messier, light-year, distant, loyal, constellation, cane, venatici, cataloged, majestic, island, universe, size, milky, lend, popular, name, sunflower, deep, exposure, follows, faint, arcing, star, stream, halo, extending, galactic, center, remnant, disrupted, satellite, spotted, remarkable, wide-field, image, including, dwarf, contribute, year"
Galileo's Europa,"Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft recorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered evidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides a deep, global ocean. Galileo's Europa image data has been remastered here, with improved calibrations to produce a color image approximating what the human eye might see. Europa's long curving fractures hint at the subsurface liquid water.  The tidal flexing the large moon experiences in its elliptical orbit around Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid. But more tantalizing is the possibility that even in the absence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to support life, making Europa one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth. What kind of life could thrive in a deep, dark, subsurface ocean? Consider planet Earth's own extreme shrimp.","galileo, europa, looping, jovian, system, late, spacecraft, recorded, stunning, view, uncovered, evidence, moon, surface, likely, hide, deep, global, ocean, image, data, remastered, improved, calibration, produce, color, approximating, human, long, curving, fracture, hint, subsurface, liquid, water, tidal, flexing, large, experience, elliptical, orbit, jupiter, supply, energy, keep, tantalizing, possibility, absence, sunlight, process, support, life, making, best, place, look, earth, kind, thrive, dark, consider, planet, extreme, shrimp"
Tardigrade in Moss,"Is this an alien?  Probably not, but of all the animals on Earth, the tardigrade might be the best candidate. That's because tardigrades are known to be able to go for decades without food or water, to survive temperatures from near absolute zero to well above the boiling point of water, to survive pressures from near zero to well above that on ocean floors, and to survive direct exposure to dangerous radiations.  The far-ranging survivability of these extremophiles was tested in 2011 outside an orbiting space shuttle. Tardigrades are so durable partly because they can repair their own DNA and reduce their body water content to a few percent. Some of these miniature water-bears almost became  extraterrestrials in 2011 when they were launched toward to the Martian moon Phobos, and again in 2021 when they were launched toward Earth's own moon, but the former launch failed, and the latter landing crashed. Tardigrades are more common than humans across most of the Earth. Pictured here in a color-enhanced electron micrograph, a millimeter-long tardigrade crawls on moss.

Supernova Discovered in Nearby Spiral Galaxy M101,"A nearby star has exploded and humanity's telescopes are turning to monitor it.  The supernova, dubbed SN 2023ixf, was discovered by Japanese astronomer Koichi Itagaki three days ago and subsequently located on automated images from the Zwicky Transient Facility two days earlier.  SN 2023ixf occurred in the photogenic Pinwheel Galaxy M101, which, being only about 21 million light years away, makes it the closest supernova seen in the past five years, the second closest in the past 10 years, and the second supernova found in M101 in the past 15 years.  Rapid follow up observations already indicate that SN 2023ixf is a Type II supernova, an explosion that occurs after a massive star runs out of nuclear fuel and collapses.  The featured image shows home spiral galaxy two days ago with the supernova highlighted, while the roll-over image shows the same galaxy a month before. SN 2023ixf will likely brighten and remain visible to telescopes for months.  Studying such a close and young Type II supernova may yield new clues about massive stars and how they explode.","supernova, discovered, nearby, spiral, galaxy, m101, star, exploded, humanity, telescope, turning, monitor, dubbed, japanese, astronomer, koichi, itagaki, located, automated, image, zwicky, transient, facility, occurred, photogenic, pinwheel, light, year, make, closest, seen, second, found, past, rapid, follow, observation, indicate, type, explosion, occurs, massive, nuclear, fuel, collapse, featured, show, home, highlighted, roll-over, month, likely, brighten, remain, visible, studying, close, young, yield, clue, explode"
Jupiter's Swirls from Juno,"Big storms are different on Jupiter. On Earth, huge hurricanes and colossal cyclones are centered on regions of low pressure, but on Jupiter, it is the high-pressure, anti-cyclone storms that are the largest. On Earth, large storms can last weeks, but on Jupiter they can last years. On Earth, large storms can be as large as a country, but on Jupiter, large storms can be as large as planet Earth. Both types of storms are known to exhibit lightning. The featured image of Jupiter's clouds was composed from images and data captured by the robotic Juno spacecraft as it swooped close to the massive planet in August 2020.  A swirling white oval is visible nearby, while numerous smaller cloud swirls extend into the distance.  On Jupiter, light-colored clouds are usually higher up than dark clouds. Despite their differences, studying storm clouds on distant Jupiter provides insights into storms and other weather patterns on familiar Earth.     Surf the Universe: Random APOD Generator","jupiter, swirl, juno, storm, different, earth, huge, hurricane, colossal, cyclone, centered, region, pressure, high-pressure, anti-cyclone, largest, large, last, week, year, country, planet, type, known, exhibit, lightning, featured, image, cloud, composed, data, captured, robotic, spacecraft, swooped, close, massive, august, swirling, white, oval, visible, numerous, smaller, extend, distance, light-colored, higher, dark, difference, studying, distant, provides, insight, weather, pattern, familiar, surf, universe, random, apod, generator"
Observatory Aligned with Moon Occulting Jupiter,"Sometimes we witness the Moon moving directly in front of -- called occulting -- one of the planets in our Solar System. Earlier this month that planet was Jupiter.  Captured here was the moment when Jupiter re-appeared from behind the surface of our Moon. The Moon was in its third quarter, two days before the dark New Moon. Now, our Moon is continuously half lit by the Sun, but when in its third quarter, relatively little of that half can be seen from the Earth. Pictured, the Moon itself was aligned behind the famous Lick Observatory in California, USA, on the summit of Mount Hamilton.

Cat's Eye Wide and Deep,"The Cat's Eye Nebula (NGC 6543) is one of the best known planetary nebulae in the sky. Its more familiar outlines are seen in the brighter central region of the nebula in this impressive wide-angle view. But this wide and deep image combining data from two telescopes also reveals its extremely faint outer halo. At an estimated distance of 3,000 light-years, the faint outer halo is over 5 light-years across. Planetary nebulae have long been appreciated as a final phase in the life of a sun-like star. More recently, some planetary nebulae are found to have halos like this one, likely formed of material shrugged off during earlier episodes in the star's evolution. While the planetary nebula phase is thought to last for around 10,000 years, astronomers estimate the age of the outer filamentary portions of this halo to be 50,000 to 90,000 years.

M84 and M86 are recognized as part of Markarian's Chain, a visually striking line-up of galaxies on the left side of this frame. Near the middle of the chain lies an intriguing interacting pair of galaxies, NGC 4438 and NGC 4435, known to some as Markarian's Eyes.

Crescent Neptune and Triton,"Gliding through the outer Solar System, in 1989 the Voyager 2 spacecraft looked toward the Sun to find this view of most distant planet Neptune and its moon Triton together in a crescent phase.  The elegant image of ice-giant planet and largest moon was taken from behind just after Voyager's closest approach.

Ida and Dactyl: Asteroid and Moon,"This asteroid has a moon.  The robot spacecraft Galileo on route to Jupiter in 1993 encountered and photographed two asteroids during its long interplanetary voyage.  The second minor planet it photographed, 243 Ida, was unexpectedly discovered to have a moon. The tiny moon, Dactyl, is only about 1.6 kilometers across and seen as a small dot on the right of the sharpened featured image.  In contrast, the potato-shaped Ida is much larger, measuring about 60 kilometers long and 25 km wide.  Dactyl is the first moon of an asteroid ever discovered -- now many asteroids are known to have moons. The names Ida and Dactyl are from Greek mythology.","dactyl, asteroid, moon, robot, spacecraft, galileo, route, jupiter, encountered, photographed, interplanetary, voyage, second, minor, planet, discovered, tiny, kilometer, seen, small, sharpened, featured, image, contrast, potato-shaped, much, larger, measuring, wide, many, known, name, greek, mythology"
Milky Way over a Turquoise Wonderland,"What glows there?  The answer depends: sea or sky? In the sea, the unusual blue glow is bioluminescence. Specifically, the glimmer arises from Noctiluca scintillans, single-celled plankton stimulated by the lapping waves. The plankton use their glow to startle and illuminate predators.  This mid-February display on an island in the Maldives was so intense that the astrophotographer described it as a turquoise wonderland. In the sky, by contrast, are the more familiar glows of stars and nebulas. The white band rising from the artificially-illuminated green plants is created by billions of stars in the central disk of our Milky Way Galaxy.  Also visible in the sky is the star cluster Omega Centauri, toward the left, and the famous Southern Cross asterism in the center. Red-glowing nebulas include the bright Carina Nebula, just right of center, and the expansive Gum Nebula on the upper right.","milky, turquoise, wonderland, glow, answer, depends, unusual, blue, bioluminescence, glimmer, arises, noctiluca, scintillans, single-celled, plankton, stimulated, lapping, wave, startle, illuminate, predator, mid-february, display, island, maldives, intense, described, contrast, familiar, star, white, band, rising, artificially-illuminated, green, plant, created, central, disk, galaxy, visible, cluster, omega, centauri, left, famous, southern, cross, asterism, center, red-glowing, nebula, include, bright, carina, expansive, upper, right"
M27: The Dumbbell Nebula,"Is this what will become of our Sun? Quite possibly.  The first hint of our Sun's future was discovered inadvertently in 1764. At that time, Charles Messier was compiling a list of diffuse objects not to be confused with comets. The 27th object on Messier's list, now known as M27 or the Dumbbell Nebula, is a planetary nebula, one of the brightest planetary nebulae on the sky and visible with binoculars toward the constellation of the Fox (Vulpecula). It takes light about 1000 years to reach us from M27, featured here in colors emitted by sulfur (red), hydrogen (green) and oxygen (blue). We now know that in about 6 billion years, our Sun will shed its outer gases into a planetary nebula like M27, while its remaining center will become an X-ray hot white dwarf star.  Understanding the physics and significance of M27 was well beyond 18th century science, though. Even today, many things remain mysterious about planetary nebulas, including how their intricate shapes are created.","dumbbell, become, first, hint, future, discovered, time, charles, compiling, list, diffuse, object, confused, messier, known, planetary, nebula, brightest, visible, binoculars, constellation, vulpecula, take, light, year, reach, featured, color, emitted, sulfur, hydrogen, green, oxygen, blue, know, shed, outer, remaining, center, x-ray, white, dwarf, star, understanding, physic, significance, 18th, century, science, today, many, thing, remain, mysterious, including, intricate, shape, created"
Simulation: A Disk Galaxy Forms,"How did we get here? We know that we live on a planet orbiting a star orbiting a galaxy, but how did all of this form? Since our universe moves too slowly to watch, faster-moving computer simulations are created to help find out. Specifically, this featured video from the IllustrisTNG collaboration tracks gas from the early universe (redshift 12) until today (redshift 0). As the simulation begins, ambient gas falls into and accumulates in a region of relatively high gravity.  After a few billion years, a well-defined center materializes from a strange and fascinating cosmic dance. Gas blobs -- some representing small satellite galaxies -- continue to fall into and become absorbed by the rotating galaxy as the present epoch is reached and the video ends.  For the Milky Way Galaxy, however, big mergers may not be over -- recent evidence indicates that our large spiral disk Galaxy will collide and coalesce with the slightly larger Andromeda spiral disk galaxy in the next few billion years.

Recycling Cassiopeia A,"Massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After a few million years, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the explosion which created this supernova remnant would have been first seen in planet Earth's sky about 350 years ago, although it took that light about 11,000 years to reach us. This false-color image, composed of X-ray and optical image data from the Chandra X-ray Observatory and Hubble Space Telescope, shows the still hot filaments and knots in the remnant. It spans about 30 light-years at the estimated distance of Cassiopeia A. High-energy X-ray emission from specific elements has been color coded, silicon in red, sulfur in yellow, calcium in green and iron in purple, to help astronomers explore the recycling of our galaxy's star stuff. Still expanding, the outer blast wave is seen in blue hues. The bright speck near the center is a neutron star, the incredibly dense, collapsed remains of the massive stellar core.","recycling, cassiopeia, massive, star, milky, galaxy, live, spectacular, life, collapsing, vast, cosmic, cloud, nuclear, furnace, ignite, create, heavy, element, core, year, enriched, material, blasted, interstellar, space, formation, begin, expanding, debris, known, example, final, phase, stellar, cycle, light, explosion, created, supernova, remnant, seen, planet, earth, took, reach, false-color, image, composed, x-ray, optical, data, chandra, observatory, hubble, telescope, show, filament, knot, span, light-year, estimated, distance, high-energy, emission, specific, color, coded, silicon, sulfur, yellow, calcium, green, iron, purple, help, astronomer, stuff, outer, blast, wave, blue, bright, speck, center, neutron, dense, collapsed, remains"
Messier 101,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy M101 is one of the last entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog, but definitely not one of the least. About 170,000 light-years across, this galaxy is enormous, almost twice the size of our own Milky Way. M101 was also one of the original spiral nebulae observed by Lord Rosse's large 19th century telescope, the Leviathan of Parsontown. Assembled from 51 exposures recorded by the Hubble Space Telescope in the 20th and 21st centuries, with additional data from ground based telescopes, this mosaic spans about 40,000 light-years across the central region of M101 in one of the highest definition spiral galaxy portraits ever released from Hubble. The sharp image shows stunning features of the galaxy's face-on disk of stars and dust along with background galaxies, some visible right through M101 itself. Also known as the Pinwheel Galaxy, M101 lies within the boundaries of the northern constellation Ursa Major, about 25 million light-years away.","beautiful, spiral, galaxy, m101, last, entry, charles, messier, famous, catalog, least, light-year, enormous, size, milky, original, nebula, observed, lord, rosse, large, 19th, century, telescope, leviathan, assembled, exposure, recorded, hubble, space, 21st, additional, data, ground, based, mosaic, span, central, region, highest, definition, portrait, released, sharp, image, show, stunning, feature, face-on, disk, star, dust, background, visible, right, known, pinwheel, boundary, northern, constellation, major"
Charon: Moon of Pluto,"A darkened and mysterious north polar region known to some as Mordor Macula caps this premier high-resolution view. The portrait of Charon, Pluto's largest moon, was captured by New Horizons near the spacecraft's closest approach on July 14, 2015. The combined blue, red, and infrared data was processed to enhance colors and follow variations in Charon's surface properties with a resolution of about 2.9 kilometers (1.8 miles). A stunning image of Charon's Pluto-facing hemisphere, it also features a clear view of an apparently moon-girdling belt of fractures and canyons that seems to separate smooth southern plains from varied northern terrain. Charon is 1,214 kilometers (754 miles) across. That's about 1/10th the size of planet Earth but a whopping 1/2 the diameter of Pluto itself, and makes it the largest satellite relative to its parent body in the Solar System. Still, the moon appears as a small bump at about the 1 o'clock position on Pluto's disk in the grainy, negative,telescopic picture inset at upper left. That view was used by James Christy and Robert Harrington at the U.S. Naval Observatory in Flagstaff to discover Charon in June of 1978.","charon, moon, pluto, darkened, mysterious, north, polar, region, known, mordor, macula, premier, high-resolution, view, portrait, largest, captured, horizon, spacecraft, closest, approach, july, combined, blue, infrared, data, processed, enhance, color, follow, variation, surface, property, resolution, kilometer, mile, stunning, image, pluto-facing, hemisphere, feature, clear, moon-girdling, belt, fracture, canyon, seems, separate, smooth, southern, plain, varied, northern, terrain, across, 1/10th, size, planet, earth, whopping, diameter, make, satellite, relative, parent, body, solar, system, appears, small, bump, o'clock, position, disk, grainy, negative, telescopic, picture, inset, upper, left, used, james, christy, robert, harrington, u.s., naval, observatory, flagstaff, discover, june"

You, your friends, your parents or children, can print it out or even color it digitally.  While coloring, you might be interested to know that even though this illustration has appeared in numerous places over the past 100 years, the actual artist remains unknown.  Furthermore, the work has no accepted name -- can you think of a good one?  The illustration, first appearing in a book by Camille Flammarion in 1888, is frequently used to show that humanity's present concepts are susceptible to being supplanted by greater truths.","color, universe, think, please, accept, famous, astronomical, illustration, preliminary, substitute, friend, parent, child, print, coloring, interested, know, appeared, numerous, place, year, actual, artist, remains, unknown, work, accepted, name, good, appearing, book, camille, flammarion, used, show, humanity, present, concept, susceptible, supplanted, greater, truth"
In the Center of the Trifid Nebula,"What's happening at the center of the Trifid Nebula? Three prominent dust lanes that give the Trifid its name all come together. Mountains of opaque dust appear near the bottom, while other dark filaments of dust are visible threaded throughout the nebula.  A single massive star visible near the center causes much of the Trifid's glow.  The Trifid, cataloged as M20, is only about 300,000 years old, making it among the youngest emission nebulas known.  The star forming nebula lies about 9,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius). The region pictured here spans about 20 light years.

Star Eats Planet,"It’s the end of a world as we know it. Specifically, the Sun-like star ZTF SLRN-2020 was seen eating one of its own planets. Although many a planet eventually dies by spiraling into their central star, the 2020 event, involving a Jupiter-like planet, was the first time it was seen directly.  The star ZTF SLRN-2020 lies about 12,000 light years from the Sun toward the constellation of the Eagle (Aquila).  In the featured animated illustration of the incident, the gas planet's atmosphere is first pictured being stripped away as it skims along the outskirts of the attracting star. Some of the planet's gas is absorbed into the star's atmosphere, while other gas is expelled into space.  By the video's end, the planet is completely engulfed and falls into the star's center, causing the star's outer atmosphere to briefly expand, heat up, and brighten. One day, about eight billion years from now, planet Earth may spiral into our Sun.","star, eats, planet, world, know, sun-like, slrn-2020, seen, eating, many, spiraling, central, event, involving, jupiter-like, first, time, light, year, constellation, eagle, aquila, featured, animated, illustration, incident, atmosphere, pictured, stripped, skim, outskirt, attracting, absorbed, expelled, space, video, engulfed, fall, center, causing, outer, briefly, expand, heat, brighten, earth, spiral"
M94: A Double Ring Galaxy,"Most galaxies don't have any rings of stars and gas -- why does M94 have two? First, spiral galaxy M94 has an inner ring of newly formed stars surrounding its nucleus, giving it not only an unusual appearance but also a strong interior glow.  A leading origin hypothesis holds that an elongated knot of stars known as a bar rotates in M94 and has generated a burst of star formation in this inner ring.  Observations have also revealed another ring, an outer ring, one that is more faint, different in color, not closed, and relatively complex.  What caused this outer ring is currently unknown. M94, pictured here, spans about 45,000 light years in total, lies about 15 million light years away, and can be seen with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Hunting Dogs  (Canes Venatici).

Elephant's Trunk and Caravan,"Like an illustration in a galactic Just So Story, the Elephant's Trunk Nebula winds through the emission region and young star cluster complex IC 1396, in the high and far off constellation of Cepheus. Seen on the left the cosmic elephant's trunk, also known as vdB 142, is over 20 light-years long. This detailed telescopic view features the bright swept-back ridges and pockets of cool interstellar dust and gas that abound in the region. But the dark, tendril-shaped clouds contain the raw material for star formation and hide protostars within. Nearly 3,000 light-years distant, the relatively faint IC 1396 complex covers a large region on the sky, spanning over 5 degrees. This rendition spans a 1 degree wide field of view though, about the angular size of 2 full moons.

Pandora's Cluster of Galaxies,"This deep field mosaicked image presents a stunning view of galaxy cluster Abell 2744 recorded by the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRCam. Also dubbed Pandora's Cluster, Abell 2744 itself appears to be a ponderous merger of three different massive galaxy clusters. It lies some 3.5 billion light-years away, toward the constellation Sculptor. Dominated by dark matter, the mega-cluster warps and distorts the fabric of spacetime, gravitationally lensing even more distant objects. Redder than the Pandora cluster galaxies many of the lensed sources are very distant galaxies in the early Universe, their lensed images stretched and distorted into arcs. Of course distinctive diffraction spikes mark foreground Milky Way stars. At the Pandora Cluster's estimated distance this cosmic box spans about 6 million light-years. But don't panic.

Mars and the Beehive,"This month, bright Mars and brilliant Venus are the prominent celestial beacons in planet Earth's western skies after sunset. Wandering through the constellation Cancer the Crab, the Red Planet was captured here on the evening of June 3 near the stars of open cluster Messier 44. Recognized since antiquity this nearby, naked-eye star cluster is also known as the Praesepe or the Beehive cluster. A swarm of stars all much younger than the Sun, the Beehive cluster is a mere 600 light-years distant. Seen with a yellowish hue, Mars is about 17 light-minutes away. On June 12/13 Venus will take its turn posing next to the stars of the Beehive cluster. But the dazzling light of Venus will make the Beehive stars difficult to see by eye alone.","beehive, month, bright, brilliant, venus, prominent, celestial, beacon, planet, earth, western, sunset, wandering, constellation, cancer, crab, captured, evening, june, star, open, cluster, messier, recognized, antiquity, naked-eye, known, swarm, younger, light-year, distant, seen, yellowish, light-minutes, take, turn, posing, next, dazzling, light, make, difficult"
The Sun and Its Missing Colors,"Here are all the visible colors of the Sun, produced by passing the Sun's light through a prism-like device.  The spectrum was created at the McMath-Pierce Solar Observatory and shows, first off, that although our white-appearing Sun emits light of nearly every color, it appears brightest in yellow-green light.  The dark patches in the featured spectrum arise from gas at or above the Sun's surface absorbing sunlight emitted below.  Since different types of gas absorb different colors of light, it is possible to determine what gasses compose the Sun.  Helium, for example, was first discovered in 1868 on a solar spectrum and only later found here on Earth.  Today, the majority of spectral absorption lines have been identified - but not all.","missing, color, visible, produced, passing, light, prism-like, device, spectrum, created, mcmath-pierce, solar, observatory, show, white-appearing, emits, appears, brightest, yellow-green, dark, patch, featured, arise, surface, absorbing, sunlight, emitted, different, type, absorb, possible, determine, compose, helium, example, discovered, found, earth, today, majority, spectral, absorption, line, identified"
The Largest Satellites of Earth,"What’s that near the Moon? It’s the International Space Station (ISS). Although the ISS may appear to be physically near the Moon, it is not — it is physically near the Earth. In low Earth orbit and circulating around our big blue marble about every 90 minutes, the ISS was captured photographically as it crossed nearly in front of the Moon. The Moon, itself in a month-long orbit around the Earth, shows a crescent phase as only a curving sliver of its Sun-illuminated half is visible from the Earth. The featured image was taken in late March from Shanghai, China and shows not only details of Earth's largest human-made satellite, but details of the cratered and barren surface of Earth's largest natural satellite. Over the next few years, humanity is planning to send more people and machines to the Moon than ever before.","largest, satellite, earth, moon, international, space, station, appear, orbit, circulating, blue, marble, minute, captured, crossed, front, month-long, show, crescent, phase, curving, sun-illuminated, half, visible, featured, image, taken, late, march, shanghai, china, detail, human-made, cratered, barren, surface, natural, next, year, humanity, planning, send, people, machine"
Moons Across Jupiter,"Jupiter's moons circle Jupiter. The featured video depicts Europa and Io, two of Jupiter's largest moons, crossing in front of the grand planet's Great Red Spot, the largest known storm system in our Solar System. The video was composed from images taken by the robotic Cassini spacecraft as it passed Jupiter in 2000, on its way to Saturn. The two moons visible are volcanic Io, in the distance, and icy Europa.  In the time-lapse video, Europa appears to overtake Io, which is odd because Io is closer to Jupiter and moves faster. The explanation is that the motion of the fast Cassini spacecraft changes the camera location significantly during imaging.  Jupiter is currently being visited by NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft, while ESA's Jupiter Icy Moons Explorer (JUICE), launched in April, is enroute.","moon, jupiter, circle, featured, video, depicts, europa, largest, crossing, front, grand, planet, great, spot, known, storm, system, solar, composed, image, taken, robotic, cassini, spacecraft, passed, saturn, visible, volcanic, distance, time-lapse, appears, overtake, move, faster, explanation, motion, change, camera, location, imaging, visited, nasa, juno, explorer, juice, launched, enroute"
The Shark Nebula,"There is no sea on Earth large enough to contain the Shark nebula. This predator apparition poses us no danger as it is composed only of interstellar gas and dust. Dark dust like that featured here is somewhat like cigarette smoke and created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars. After being expelled with gas and gravitationally recondensing, massive stars may carve intricate structures into their birth cloud using their high energy light and fast stellar winds as sculpting tools.  The heat they generate evaporates the murky molecular cloud as well as causing ambient hydrogen gas to disperse and glow red.  During disintegration, we humans can enjoy imagining these great clouds as common icons, like we do for water clouds on Earth. Including smaller dust nebulae such as Lynds Dark Nebula 1235 and Van den Bergh 149 & 150, the Shark nebula spans about 15 light years and lies about 650 light years away toward the constellation of the King of Aethiopia (Cepheus).","shark, nebula, earth, large, contain, predator, apparition, pose, danger, composed, interstellar, dust, dark, featured, like, cigarette, smoke, created, cool, giant, star, expelled, recondensing, massive, carve, intricate, structure, birth, cloud, using, high, energy, light, stellar, wind, sculpting, tool, heat, generate, evaporates, murky, molecular, causing, ambient, hydrogen, disperse, glow, disintegration, human, enjoy, imagining, great, common, icon, water, including, smaller, lynds, bergh, span, year, constellation, king, aethiopia, cepheus"
M15: Dense Globular Star Cluster,"Messier 15 is an immense swarm of over 100,000 stars. A 13 billion year old relic of the early formative years of our galaxy it's one of about 170 globular star clusters that still roam the halo of the Milky Way. Centered in this sharp reprocessed Hubble image, M15 lies some 35,000 light-years away toward the constellation Pegasus. Its diameter is about 200 light-years, but more than half its stars are packed into the central 10 light-years or so, making one of the densest concentrations of stars known. Hubble-based measurements of the increasing velocities of M15's central stars are evidence that a massive black hole resides at the center of the dense cluster. M15 is also known to harbour a planetary nebula. Called Pease 1 (aka PN Ps 1), it can be seen in this image as a small blue blob below and just right of center.","dense, globular, star, cluster, immense, swarm, year, relic, formative, galaxy, roam, halo, milky, centered, sharp, reprocessed, hubble, image, light-year, constellation, pegasus, diameter, half, packed, central, making, densest, concentration, known, hubble-based, measurement, increasing, velocity, evidence, massive, black, hole, resides, center, harbour, planetary, nebula, called, seen, small, blue, blob"

Saturn's Northern Hexagon,"Why would clouds form a hexagon on Saturn? Nobody is sure.   Originally discovered during the Voyager flybys of Saturn in the 1980s, nobody has ever seen anything like it anywhere else in the Solar System.  Acquiring its first sunlit views of far northern Saturn in late 2012, the Cassini spacecraft's wide-angle camera recorded this stunning, false-color image of the ringed planet's north pole. The composite of near-infrared image data results in red hues for low clouds and green for high ones, giving the Saturnian cloudscape a vivid appearance. This and similar images show the stability of the hexagon even 20+ years after Voyager.  Movies of Saturn's North Pole show the cloud structure maintaining its hexagonal structure while rotating.  Unlike individual clouds appearing like a hexagon on Earth, the Saturn cloud pattern appears to have six well defined sides of nearly equal length. Four Earths could fit inside the hexagon. Beyond the cloud tops at the upper right, arcs of the planet's eye-catching rings are tinted bright blue.","saturn, northern, hexagon, cloud, form, nobody, sure, discovered, voyager, flybys, seen, anything, solar, system, acquiring, first, sunlit, view, late, cassini, spacecraft, wide-angle, camera, recorded, stunning, false-color, image, ringed, planet, north, pole, composite, near-infrared, data, result, green, high, giving, saturnian, cloudscape, vivid, appearance, similar, show, stability, year, movie, structure, maintaining, hexagonal, rotating, individual, appearing, earth, pattern, appears, defined, side, equal, length, upper, right, eye-catching, ring, tinted, bright, blue"
The Busy Center of the Lagoon Nebula,"The center of the Lagoon Nebula is a whirlwind of spectacular star formation. Visible near the image center, at least two long funnel-shaped clouds, each roughly half a light-year long, have been formed by extreme stellar winds and intense energetic starlight.  A tremendously bright nearby star, Herschel 36, lights the area.  Vast walls of dust hide and redden other hot young stars.  As energy from these stars pours into the cool dust and gas, large temperature differences in adjoining regions can be created generating shearing winds which may cause the funnels.  This picture, spanning about 15 light years, combines images taken in four colors by the orbiting Hubble Space Telescope.  The Lagoon Nebula, also known as M8, lies about 5000 light years distant toward the constellation of the Archer (Sagittarius).","busy, center, lagoon, nebula, spectacular, star, formation, visible, image, least, long, funnel-shaped, cloud, light-year, formed, extreme, stellar, wind, intense, energetic, starlight, bright, nearby, herschel, light, area, wall, dust, hide, redden, young, energy, pours, cool, large, temperature, difference, adjoining, region, created, generating, shearing, cause, funnel, picture, spanning, year, combine, taken, color, orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, known, distant, constellation, archer, sagittarius"
The Ñandú in the Milky Way,"Have you seen the bird in the Milky Way? Beyond the man in the Moon, the night sky is filled with stories, and cultures throughout history have projected some of their most enduring legends onto the stars and dust above.  Generations of people see these celestial icons, hear their associated stories, and pass them down. Pictured here is not only a segment of the central band of our Milky Way galaxy, but, according to folklore of several native peoples of Uruguay, the outline of a great bird called Ñandú. Furthermore, Ñandú's footprint is associated with the Southern Cross asterism. In the foreground, in silhouette, is a statue of María Micaela Guyunusa, an indigenous woman of the Charrúa people who lived in the 1800s and endures as a symbol of colonial resistance.  The composite image was taken in mid-April in Cabo Polonio, Uruguay, with the Atlantic Ocean in the background.","ñandú, milky, seen, bird, moon, night, filled, story, culture, history, projected, enduring, legend, star, dust, generation, people, celestial, icon, hear, associated, pictured, segment, central, band, galaxy, according, several, native, uruguay, outline, great, called, footprint, southern, cross, asterism, foreground, silhouette, statue, maría, micaela, guyunusa, indigenous, woman, charrúa, lived, endures, symbol, colonial, resistance, composite, image, taken, mid-april, cabo, polonio, atlantic, ocean, background"
Three Sun Paths,"Does the Sun follow the same path every day? No.  The Sun's path changes during the year, tracing a longer route during the summer than the winter. Pictured here, the Sun's arc was captured from noon to sunset on three days,  from highest in the sky to lowest: summer solstice, equinox, and winter solstice.  The images were taken near Gatto Corvino Village in Sicily, Italy in 2020 and 2021. The path and time the Sun spends in the sky is more important in determining the season than how close the Earth is to the Sun.  In fact, the Earth is closest to the Sun in January, during northern winter.  Today is a solstice, so today the Sun is taking its longest path of the year across the sky in Earth's  northern hemisphere, but the shortest path in the southern hemisphere.","path, follow, change, year, tracing, longer, route, summer, winter, pictured, captured, sunset, highest, lowest, solstice, equinox, image, taken, gatto, corvino, village, italy, time, spends, important, determining, season, close, earth, fact, closest, january, northern, today, taking, longest, shortest, southern, hemisphere"
Stars and Dust across Corona Australis,"Cosmic dust clouds cross a rich field of stars in this telescopic vista near the northern boundary of Corona Australis, the Southern Crown. Part of a sprawling molecular cloud complex this star forming region is a mere 500 light-years away. That's about one third the distance of the more famous stellar nursery known as the Orion Nebula. The 2 degree wide frame would span 15 light-years at the clouds' estimated distance. Mixed with bright nebulosities the dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way and obscure from view embedded stars still in the process of formation. Large dark nebula Bernes 157 is on the left. To its right are a group of pretty reflection nebulae cataloged as NGC 6726, 6727, 6729, and IC 4812. Their characteristic blue color is produced as light from hot stars is reflected by the cosmic dust. The more compact NGC 6729 surrounds young variable star R Coronae Australis. Just below it, filamentary arcs and loops are identified as Herbig Haro objects associated with energetic newborn stars. In fact, at the heart of this area lies the Coronet Cluster, one of the nearest and most active star forming regions.","star, dust, corona, australis, cosmic, cloud, cross, rich, field, telescopic, vista, northern, boundary, southern, crown, part, sprawling, molecular, complex, forming, region, light-year, third, distance, famous, stellar, nursery, known, orion, nebula, degree, wide, frame, span, estimated, mixed, bright, nebulosities, block, light, distant, background, milky, obscure, view, embedded, process, formation, large, dark, berne, left, right, group, pretty, reflection, cataloged, characteristic, blue, color, produced, reflected, compact, surround, young, variable, filamentary, loop, identified, herbig, haro, object, associated, energetic, newborn, fact, heart, area, coronet, cluster, nearest, active"
Giant Galaxies in Pavo,"Over 500,000 light years across, NGC 6872 (top right) is a truly enormous barred spiral galaxy, at least 5 times the size of our own very large Milky Way. The appearance of this giant galaxy's distorted and stretched out spiral arms suggests the magnificent wings of a giant bird. Of course its popular moniker is the Condor galaxy. It lies about 200 million light-years distant toward the southern constellation Pavo, the Peacock. Lined with star-forming regions, the distorted spiral arms are due to NGC 6872's gravitational interaction with the nearby smaller galaxy IC 4970, seen just above the giant galaxy's core. The Pavo galaxy group's dominant giant elliptical galaxy, NGC 6876 is below and left of the soaring Condor galaxy.","giant, galaxy, pavo, light, year, right, enormous, barred, spiral, least, time, size, large, milky, appearance, distorted, stretched, suggests, magnificent, wing, bird, course, popular, moniker, condor, light-year, distant, southern, constellation, peacock, lined, star-forming, region, gravitational, interaction, smaller, seen, core, group, dominant, elliptical, left, soaring"
3D Ingenuity,"The multicolor, stereo imaging Mastcam-Z on the Perseverance rover zoomed in to capture this 3D close-up (get out your red/blue glasses) of the Mars Ingenuity helicopter on mission sol 45. That's Earth-date 2021 April 5. Casting a shadow on the Martian surface, Ingenuity is standing alone on its four landing legs next to the rover's wheel tracks. The experimental helicopter's solar panel, charging batteries that keep it warm through the cold Martian nights and power its flight, sits just above Ingenuity's two 1.2 meter (4 foot) long counter-rotating blades. Thirteen sols later, on April 19, Ingenuity became the first aircraft to perform powered, controlled flight on another planet. It has since gone on to complete more than 50 flights through the thin atmosphere of Mars.","ingenuity, multicolor, stereo, imaging, mastcam-z, perseverance, rover, zoomed, capture, close-up, red/blue, glass, helicopter, mission, earth-date, april, casting, shadow, martian, surface, standing, landing, wheel, track, experimental, solar, panel, charging, battery, keep, warm, cold, night, power, flight, sits, meter, foot, counter-rotating, blade, thirteen, became, first, aircraft, perform, powered, controlled, planet, gone, complete, thin, atmosphere"
Lightning on Jupiter,"Does lightning occur only on Earth?  No.  Spacecraft in our Solar System have detected lightning on other planets, including Mars, Jupiter and Saturn, and lightning is likely on Venus, Uranus, and Neptune.  Lightning is a sudden rush of electrically charged particles from one location to another. On Earth, drafts of colliding ice and water droplets usually create lightning-generating charge separation, but what happens on Jupiter? Images and data from NASA's Jupiter-orbiting Juno spacecraft bolster previous speculation that Jovian lightning is also created in clouds containing water and ice.  In the featured Juno photograph, an optical flash was captured in a large cloud vortex near Jupiter's north pole.  During the next few months, Juno will perform several close sweeps over Jupiter's night side, likely allowing the robotic probe to capture more data and images of Jovian lightning.","lightning, jupiter, occur, earth, spacecraft, solar, system, detected, planet, including, saturn, likely, venus, neptune, sudden, rush, charged, particle, location, draft, colliding, water, droplet, create, lightning-generating, charge, separation, happens, image, data, jupiter-orbiting, juno, previous, speculation, jovian, created, cloud, containing, featured, photograph, optical, flash, captured, large, vortex, north, pole, next, month, perform, several, close, sweep, night, side, allowing, robotic, probe, capture"
The Belt of Venus over Mount Everest,"You've surely seen it, but you might not have noticed it.  During a cloudless twilight, just before sunrise or after sunset, part of the atmosphere above the horizon appears slightly dark and off-color.  Called the Belt of Venus, this transitional band between the dark eclipsed sky and the bright day sky can be seen most prominently in the direction opposite the Sun.  Straight above, blue sky is normal sunlight reflecting off the atmosphere, while near the horizon the clear sky can appear more orange or red.  In the Belt of Venus, the atmosphere reflects more light from the setting (or rising) Sun and so appears more red.  Featured here, the Belt of Venus was photographed over several Himalayan mountains including, second from the right, Mount Everest, the tallest mountain on Earth.  Although usually not mentioned, the belt is frequently caught by accident in other photographs.","belt, venus, mount, everest, seen, noticed, cloudless, twilight, sunrise, sunset, part, horizon, appears, dark, off-color, called, transitional, band, eclipsed, bright, direction, opposite, straight, blue, normal, sunlight, reflecting, clear, appear, orange, atmosphere, reflects, light, setting, rising, featured, photographed, several, himalayan, mountain, including, second, right, earth, mentioned, caught, accident, photograph"
MAVEN's Ultraviolet Mars,"These two global views of Mars were captured at ultraviolet wavelengths, beyond the spectrum visible to human eyes. Recorded by the MAVEN spacecraft's Imaging Ultraviolet Spectrograph instrument in July 2022 (left) and January 2023, three otherwise invisible ultraviolet bands are mapped into red, green, and blue colors. That color scheme presents the Red Planet's surface features in shades of tan and green. Haze and clouds appear white or blue, while high altitude ozone takes on a dramatic purple hue. On the left, Mars' south polar ice cap is in brilliant white at the bottom but shrinking during the southern hemisphere's summer season. On the right, the northern hemisphere's polar region is seen shrouded in clouds and atmospheric ozone. Known to some as the Mars Atmosphere and Volatile EvolutioN spacecraft, MAVEN has been exploring Mars' tenuous upper atmosphere, ionosphere, and its interactions with the Sun and solar wind since 2014.","maven, ultraviolet, global, view, captured, wavelength, spectrum, visible, human, recorded, spacecraft, imaging, spectrograph, instrument, july, left, january, invisible, band, mapped, green, blue, color, scheme, present, planet, surface, feature, shade, haze, cloud, appear, white, high, altitude, ozone, take, dramatic, purple, south, polar, brilliant, bottom, shrinking, southern, hemisphere, summer, season, right, northern, region, seen, shrouded, atmospheric, known, volatile, evolution, exploring, tenuous, upper, atmosphere, ionosphere, interaction, solar, wind"
Messier 24: Sagittarius Star Cloud,"Unlike most entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog of deep sky objects, M24 is not a bright galaxy, star cluster, or nebula. It's a gap in nearby, obscuring interstellar dust clouds that allows a view of the distant stars in the Sagittarius spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. Direct your gaze through this gap with binoculars or small telescope and you are looking through a window over 300 light-years wide at stars some 10,000 light-years or more from Earth. Sometimes called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, M24's luminous stars fill this gorgeous starscape.  Covering over 3 degrees or the width of 6 full moons in the constellation Sagittarius, the telescopic field of view includes dark markings B92 and B93 near center, along with other clouds of dust and glowing nebulae toward the center of the Milky Way.","sagittarius, star, cloud, entry, charles, messier, famous, catalog, deep, object, bright, galaxy, cluster, nebula, obscuring, interstellar, dust, allows, view, distant, spiral, milky, direct, gaze, binoculars, small, telescope, looking, window, light-year, wide, earth, called, luminous, gorgeous, starscape, covering, degree, width, full, moon, constellation, telescopic, field, includes, dark, marking, center, glowing"
A Message from the Gravitational Universe,"Monitoring 68 pulsars with very large radio telescopes, the North American Nanohertz Observatory for Gravitational Waves (NANOGrav) has uncovered evidence for the gravitational wave (GW) background by carefully measuring slight shifts in the arrival times of pulses.  These shifts are correlated between different pulsars in a way that indicates that they are caused by GWs. This GW background is likely due to hundreds of thousands or even millions of supermassive black hole binaries.  Teams in Europe, Asia and Australia have also independently reported their results today. Previously, the LIGO and Virgo detectors have detected higher-frequency GWs from the merging of individual pairs of massive orbiting objects, such as stellar-mass black holes. The featured illustration highlights this spacetime-shaking result by depicting two orbiting supermassive black holes and several of the pulsars that would appear to have slight timing shifts.  The imprint these GWs make on spacetime itself is illustrated by a distorted grid.

Orbits of Potentially Hazardous Asteroids,"Are asteroids dangerous? Some are, but the likelihood of a dangerous asteroid striking the Earth during any given year is low. Because some past mass extinction events have been linked to asteroid impacts, however, humanity has made it a priority to find and catalog those asteroids that may one day affect life on Earth. Pictured here are the orbits of the over 1,000 known Potentially Hazardous Asteroids (PHAs). These documented tumbling boulders of rock and ice are over 140 meters across and will pass within 7.5 million kilometers of Earth -- about 20 times the distance to the Moon. Although none of them will strike the Earth in the next 100 years -- not all PHAs have been discovered, and past 100 years, many orbits become hard to predict. Were an asteroid of this size to impact the Earth, it could raise dangerous tsunamis, for example. To investigate Earth-saving strategies, NASA successfully tested the Double Asteroid Redirection Test (DART) mission last year. Of course, rocks and ice bits of much smaller size strike the Earth every day, usually pose no danger, and sometimes create memorable fireball and meteor displays.

Three Galaxies in Draco,"This tantalizing trio of galaxies sometimes called the Draco Group, is located in the northern constellation of (you guessed it) Draco, the Dragon. From left to right are face-on spiral NGC 5985, elliptical galaxy NGC 5982, and edge-on spiral NGC 5981, all found within this single telescopic field of view that spans a little more than the width of the full moon. While the group is far too small to be a galaxy cluster, and has not been catalogued as a compact galaxy group, the three galaxies all do lie roughly 100 million light-years from planet Earth. Not as well known as other tight groupings of galaxies, the contrast in visual appearance still makes this triplet an attractive subject for astroimagers. On close examination with spectrographs, the bright core of striking spiral NGC 5985 shows prominent emission in specific wavelengths of light, prompting astronomers to classify it as a Seyfert, a type of active galaxy. This impressively deep exposure hints at a faint dim halo along with sharp-edged shells surrounding elliptical NGC 5982, evidence of past galactic mergers. It also reveals many even more distant background galaxies.","galaxy, draco, tantalizing, trio, called, group, located, northern, constellation, guessed, dragon, left, right, face-on, spiral, elliptical, edge-on, found, single, telescopic, field, view, span, little, width, full, moon, small, cluster, catalogued, compact, light-year, planet, earth, known, tight, grouping, contrast, visual, appearance, make, triplet, attractive, subject, astroimagers, close, examination, spectrograph, bright, striking, show, prominent, emission, specific, wavelength, light, prompting, astronomer, classify, seyfert, type, active, deep, exposure, hint, faint, halo, sharp-edged, shell, surrounding, evidence, galactic, merger, reveals, many, distant, background"
Milky Way and Aurora over Antarctica,"It was one of the better skies of this long night. In parts of Antarctica, not only is it winter, but the Sun can spend weeks below the horizon. At China's Zhongshan Station, people sometimes venture out into the cold to photograph a spectacular night sky. The featured image from one such outing was taken in mid-July of 2015, just before the end of this polar night. Pointing up, the wide angle lens captured not only the ground at the bottom, but at the top as well.  In the foreground, a colleague is taking pictures. In the distance, a spherical satellite receiver and several windmills are visible. Numerous stars dot the night sky, including Sirius and Canopus. Far in the background, stretching overhead from horizon to horizon, is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy.

Venus in Ultraviolet from Akatsuki,"Why is Venus so different from Earth?  To help find out, Japan launched the robotic Akatsuki spacecraft which entered orbit around Venus late in 2015 after an unplanned five-year adventure around the inner Solar System.  Even though Akatsuki was past its original planned lifetime, the spacecraft and instruments were operating so well that much of its original mission was reinstated. Also known as the Venus Climate Orbiter, Akatsuki's instruments investigated unknowns about Earth's sister planet, including whether volcanoes are still active, whether lightning occurs in the dense atmosphere, and why wind speeds greatly exceed the planet's rotation speed. In the featured image taken by Akatsuki's UVI camera, the day-side of Venus is seen shown with planet-scale V-shaped cloud pattern. The image displays three ultraviolet colors and indicates a dip in the relative abundance of sulfur dioxide shown in faint blue.  Analyses of Akatsuki images and data has shown, among other discoveries, that Venus has equatorial jet similar to Earth's jet stream.","venus, ultraviolet, akatsuki, different, earth, help, find, japan, launched, robotic, spacecraft, entered, orbit, late, unplanned, five-year, adventure, inner, solar, system, past, original, planned, lifetime, instrument, operating, much, mission, reinstated, known, climate, orbiter, investigated, unknown, sister, planet, including, volcano, active, lightning, occurs, dense, wind, speed, exceed, rotation, featured, image, taken, camera, day-side, seen, shown, planet-scale, v-shaped, cloud, pattern, display, color, indicates, relative, abundance, sulfur, faint, blue, analysis, data, discovery, equatorial, similar, stream"
Aurora over Icelandic Waterfall,"It seemed like the sky exploded. The original idea was to photograph an aurora over a waterfall. After waiting for hours under opaque clouds, though, hope was running out. Others left. Then, unexpectedly, the clouds moved away. Suddenly, particles from a large solar magnetic storm were visible impacting the Earth's upper atmosphere with full effect. The night sky filled with colors and motion in a thrilling auroral display.  Struggling to steady the camera from high Earthly winds, the 34 exposures that compose the featured image were taken.  The resulting featured composite image shows the photogenic Godafoss (Goðafoss) waterfall in northern Iceland in front of a very active aurora in late February. The solar surface explosion that expelled the energetic particles occurred a few days before.  Our Sun is showing an impressive amount of surface activity as it approaches solar maximum, indicating that more impressive auroras are likely to appear in Earth's northern and southern sky over the next few years.","aurora, icelandic, waterfall, seemed, exploded, original, idea, photograph, waiting, hour, opaque, cloud, hope, running, others, left, moved, particle, large, solar, magnetic, storm, visible, impacting, earth, upper, full, effect, night, filled, color, motion, thrilling, auroral, display, struggling, steady, camera, high, wind, exposure, compose, featured, image, taken, resulting, composite, show, photogenic, godafoss, goðafoss, northern, iceland, active, late, february, surface, explosion, expelled, energetic, occurred, showing, impressive, amount, activity, approach, maximum, indicating, likely, appear, southern, year"
A Map of the Observable Universe,"What if you could see out to the edge of the observable universe? You would see galaxies, galaxies, galaxies, and then, well, quasars, which are the bright centers of distant galaxies.  To expand understanding of the very largest scales that humanity can see, a map of the galaxies and quasars found by the Sloan Digital Sky Survey from 2000 to 2020 -- out to near the edge of the observable universe -- has been composed. Featured here, one wedge from this survey encompasses about 200,000 galaxies and quasars out beyond a look-back time of 12 billion years and cosmological redshift 5.  Almost every dot in the nearby lower part of the illustration represents a galaxy, with redness indicating increasing redshift and distance. Similarly, almost every dot on the upper part represents a distant quasar, with blue-shaded dots being closer than red. Clearly shown among many discoveries, gravity between galaxies has caused the nearby universe to condense and become increasingly more filamentary than the distant universe.

Fireworks vs Supermoon,"On July 4, an almost Full Moon rose in planet Earth's evening skies. Also known as a Buck Moon, the full lunar phase (full on July 3 at 11:39 UTC) was near perigee, the closest point in the Moon's almost monthly orbit around planet Earth. That qualified this July's Full Moon as a supermoon, the first of four supermoons in 2023. Seen from Cocoa Beach along Florida's Space Coast on July 4, any big, bright, beautiful Full Moon would still have to compete for attention though. July's super-moonrise was captured here against a super-colorful fireworks display.","firework, supermoon, july, full, moon, rose, planet, earth, evening, known, buck, lunar, phase, perigee, closest, point, monthly, orbit, qualified, supermoons, seen, cocoa, beach, florida, space, coast, bright, beautiful, compete, attention, super-moonrise, captured, super-colorful, display"
The Double Cluster in Perseus,"This pretty starfield spans about three full moons (1.5 degrees) across the heroic northern constellation of Perseus. It holds the famous pair of open star clusters, h and Chi Persei. Also cataloged as NGC 869 (top) and NGC 884, both clusters are about 7,000 light-years away and contain stars much younger and hotter than the Sun.  Separated by only a few hundred light-years, the clusters are both 13 million years young based on the ages of their individual stars, evidence that they were likely a product of the same star-forming region. Always a rewarding sight in binoculars, the Double Cluster is even visible to the unaided eye from dark locations.","double, cluster, perseus, starfield, span, full, moon, degree, heroic, northern, constellation, hold, famous, pair, open, star, persei, cataloged, light-year, contain, much, younger, hotter, separated, year, young, based, individual, evidence, likely, product, star-forming, region, rewarding, sight, binoculars, visible, unaided, dark, location"
Stickney Crater,"Stickney Crater, the largest crater on the martian moon Phobos, is named for Chloe Angeline Stickney Hall, mathematician and wife of astronomer Asaph Hall. Asaph Hall discovered both the Red Planet's moons in 1877. Over 9 kilometers across, Stickney is nearly half the diameter of Phobos itself, so large that the impact that blasted out the crater likely came close to shattering the tiny moon. This enhanced-color image of Stickney and surroundings was recorded by the HiRISE camera onboard the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter as it passed within some six thousand kilometers of Phobos in March of 2008. Even though the surface gravity of asteroid-like Phobos is less than 1/1000th Earth's gravity, streaks suggest loose material slid down inside the crater walls over time. Light bluish regions near the crater's rim could indicate a relatively freshly exposed surface. The origin of the curious grooves along the surface is mysterious but may be related to tidal stresses experienced by close-orbiting Phobos or the crater-forming impact itself.","stickney, crater, largest, martian, moon, phobos, named, chloe, angeline, hall, mathematician, wife, astronomer, asaph, discovered, planet, kilometer, half, diameter, large, impact, blasted, likely, came, shattering, tiny, enhanced-color, image, surroundings, recorded, hirise, camera, onboard, reconnaissance, orbiter, passed, march, surface, gravity, asteroid-like, 1/1000th, earth, streak, suggest, loose, material, slid, wall, time, light, bluish, region, indicate, exposed, origin, curious, groove, mysterious, related, tidal, stress, experienced, close-orbiting, crater-forming"
Doomed Star Eta Carinae,"Carinae may be about to explode.  But no one knows when - it may be next year, it may be one million years from now. Eta Carinae's mass - about 100 times greater than our Sun - makes it an excellent candidate for a full blown supernova. Historical records do show that about 170 years ago Eta Carinae underwent an unusual outburst that made it one of the brightest stars in the southern sky.  Eta Carinae, in the Keyhole Nebula, is the only star currently thought to emit natural LASER light. This featured image brings out details in the unusual nebula that surrounds this rogue star.  Diffraction spikes, caused by the telescope, are visible as bright multi-colored streaks emanating from Eta Carinae's center.  Two distinct lobes of the Homunculus Nebula encompass the hot central region, while some strange radial streaks are visible in red extending toward the image right. The lobes are filled with lanes of gas and dust which absorb the blue and ultraviolet light emitted near the center.  The streaks, however, remain unexplained.","doomed, star, carina, explode, know, next, year, mass, time, greater, make, excellent, candidate, full, blown, supernova, historical, record, show, underwent, unusual, made, brightest, southern, keyhole, nebula, thought, natural, laser, light, featured, image, brings, detail, surround, rogue, diffraction, spike, caused, telescope, visible, bright, multi-colored, streak, emanating, center, distinct, lobe, homunculus, encompass, central, region, strange, radial, extending, right, filled, lane, dust, absorb, blue, ultraviolet, emitted, remain, unexplained"

Visible in the featured image are red glowing emission nebulas of hydrogen, blue reflection nebulas of dust, dark absorption nebulas of dust, and the stars that formed from them.  The first massive stars formed from the dense gas will emit energetic light and winds that erode, fragment, and sculpt their birthplace.  And then they explode. The resulting morass can be as beautiful as it is complex.

Sunspots on an Active Sun,"Why is our Sun so active now? No one is sure.  An increase in surface activity was expected because our Sun is approaching solar maximum in 2025. However, last month our Sun sprouted more sunspots than in any month during the entire previous 11-year solar cycle -- and even dating back to 2002. The featured picture is a composite of images taken every day from January to June by NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory.  Showing a high abundance of sunspots, large individual spots can be tracked across the Sun's disk, left to right, over about two weeks.  As a solar cycle continues, sunspots typically appear closer to the equator.  Sunspots are just one way that our Sun displays surface activity -- another is flares and coronal mass ejections (CMEs) that expel particles out into the Solar System. Since these particles can affect astronauts and electronics, tracking surface disturbances is of more than aesthetic value.  Conversely, solar activity can have very high aesthetic value -- in the Earth's atmosphere when they trigger aurora.","sunspot, active, sure, increase, surface, activity, expected, approaching, solar, maximum, last, month, sprouted, entire, previous, 11-year, cycle, dating, featured, picture, composite, image, taken, january, june, nasa, dynamic, observatory, showing, high, abundance, large, individual, spot, tracked, disk, left, right, week, continues, appear, equator, display, flare, coronal, mass, ejection, cmes, expel, particle, system, affect, electronics, tracking, disturbance, aesthetic, value, earth, atmosphere, trigger, aurora"
Rings and Bar of Spiral Galaxy NGC 1398,"Why do some spiral galaxies have a ring around the center? Spiral galaxy NGC 1398 not only has a ring of pearly stars, gas and dust around its center, but a bar of stars and gas across its center, and spiral arms that appear like ribbons farther out.  The featured deep image from Observatorio El Sauce in Chile shows the grand spiral galaxy in impressive detail. NGC 1398 lies about 65 million light years distant, meaning the light we see today left this galaxy when dinosaurs were disappearing from the Earth.  The photogenic galaxy is visible with a small telescope toward the constellation of the Furnace (Fornax). The ring near the center is likely an expanding density wave of star formation, caused either by a gravitational encounter with another galaxy, or by the galaxy's own gravitational asymmetries.","ring, spiral, galaxy, center, star, dust, appear, ribbon, featured, deep, image, observatorio, sauce, chile, show, grand, impressive, detail, light, year, distant, meaning, today, left, dinosaur, disappearing, earth, photogenic, visible, small, telescope, constellation, furnace, fornax, expanding, density, wave, formation, caused, gravitational, encounter, asymmetry"
Webb's Rho Ophiuchi,"A mere 390 light-years away, Sun-like stars and future planetary systems are forming in the Rho Ophiuchi molecular cloud complex, the closest star-forming region to our fair planet. The James Webb Space Telescope's NIRCam peered into the nearby natal chaos to capture this infrared image at an inspiring scale. The spectacular cosmic snapshot was released to celebrate the successful first year of Webb's exploration of the Universe. The frame spans less than a light-year across the Rho Ophiuchi region and contains about 50 young stars. Brighter stars clearly sport Webb's characteristic pattern of diffraction spikes.

Comet C/2023 E1 ATLAS near Perihelion,"Comet C/2023 E1 (ATLAS) was just spotted in March, another comet found by the NASA funded Asteroid Terrestrial-impact Last Alert System.  On July 1 this Comet ATLAS reached perihelion, its closest approach to the Sun. Days later the telescopic comet was captured in this frame sporting a pretty greenish coma and faint, narrow ion tail against a background of stars in the far northern constellation Ursa Minor.  This comet's closest approach to Earth is still to come though. On August 18 this visitor to the inner Solar System will be a mere 3 light-minutes or so from our fair planet. Based on its inclination to the ecliptic plane and orbital period of about 85 years C/2023 E1 (ATLAS) is considered a Halley-type comet.","comet, c/2023, atlas, perihelion, spotted, march, found, funded, asteroid, terrestrial-impact, last, alert, system, july, reached, closest, approach, telescopic, captured, frame, sporting, pretty, greenish, coma, faint, narrow, tail, background, star, northern, constellation, ursa, minor, earth, come, august, visitor, inner, solar, mere, light-minutes, fair, planet, based, inclination, ecliptic, plane, orbital, period, year, considered, halley-type"
Webb's First Deep Field,"This stunning infrared image was released one year ago as the James Webb Space Telescope began its exploration of the cosmos. The view of the early Universe toward the southern constellation Volans was achieved in 12.5 hours of exposure with Webb's NIRCam instrument. Of course the stars with six spikes are well within our own Milky Way. Their diffraction pattern is characteristic of Webb's 18 hexagonal mirror segments operating together as a single 6.5 meter diameter primary mirror. The thousands of galaxies flooding the field of view are members of the distant galaxy cluster SMACS0723-73, some 4.6 billion light-years away. Luminous arcs that seem to infest the deep field are even more distant galaxies though. Their images are distorted and magnified by the dark matter dominated mass of the galaxy cluster, an effect known as gravitational lensing. Analyzing light from two separate arcs below the bright spiky star, Webb's NIRISS instrument indicates the arcs are both images of the same background galaxy. And that galaxy's light took about 9.5 billion years to reach the James Webb Space Telescope.","webb, first, deep, field, stunning, infrared, image, released, year, james, space, telescope, began, exploration, cosmos, view, early, universe, southern, constellation, volans, achieved, hour, exposure, nircam, instrument, course, star, spike, milky, diffraction, pattern, characteristic, hexagonal, mirror, segment, operating, single, meter, diameter, primary, galaxy, flooding, member, distant, cluster, smacs0723-73, light-year, luminous, seem, distorted, magnified, dark, matter, dominated, mass, effect, known, gravitational, lensing, analyzing, light, separate, bright, spiky, niriss, indicates, background, took, reach"
Meteor and Milky Way over the Alps,"Now this was a view with a thrill. From Mount Tschirgant in the Alps, you can see not only nearby towns and distant Tyrolean peaks, but also, weather permitting, stars, nebulas, and the band of the Milky Way Galaxy. What made the arduous climb worthwhile this night, though, was another peak -- the peak of the 2018 Perseids Meteor Shower. As hoped, dispersing clouds allowed a picturesque sky-gazing session that included many faint meteors, all while a carefully positioned camera took a series of exposures. Suddenly, a thrilling meteor -- bright and colorful -- slashed down right next to the nearly vertical band of the Milky Way.  As luck would have it, the camera caught it too.  Therefore, a new image in the series was quickly taken with one of the sky-gazers posing on the nearby peak. Later, all of the images were digitally combined.","meteor, milky, view, thrill, mount, tschirgant, nearby, town, distant, tyrolean, peak, permitting, star, nebula, band, galaxy, made, arduous, climb, worthwhile, night, perseids, shower, hoped, dispersing, cloud, allowed, picturesque, sky-gazing, session, included, many, faint, positioned, camera, took, series, exposure, thrilling, bright, colorful, slashed, right, next, vertical, luck, caught, image, taken, sky-gazers, posing, later, combined"
Shells and Arcs around Star CW Leonis,"What's happening around this star? No one is sure. CW Leonis is the closest carbon star, a star that appears orange because of atmospheric carbon dispersed from interior nuclear fusion. But CW Leonis also appears engulfed in a gaseous carbon-rich nebula. What causes the nebula's complexity is unknown, but its geometry of shells and arcs are surely intriguing. The featured image by the Hubble Space Telescope details this complexity. The low surface gravity of carbon stars enhances their ability to expel carbon and carbon compounds into space. Some of this carbon ends up forming dark dust that is commonly seen in the nebulas of young star-forming regions and the disks of galaxies.  Humans and all Earth-based life are carbon-based, and at least some of our carbon was likely once circulating in the atmospheres of near-death stars like carbon stars.","shell, star, leonis, happening, sure, closest, carbon, appears, orange, atmospheric, dispersed, interior, nuclear, fusion, gaseous, carbon-rich, nebula, cause, complexity, unknown, geometry, intriguing, featured, image, hubble, space, telescope, detail, surface, gravity, enhances, ability, expel, compound, forming, dark, dust, seen, young, star-forming, region, disk, galaxy, human, earth-based, life, carbon-based, least, likely, circulating, near-death"
Milky Way above La Palma Observatory,"What's happening in the night sky? To help find out, telescopes all over the globe will be pointing into deep space.  Investigations will include trying to understand the early universe, finding and tracking Earth-menacing asteroids, searching for planets that might contain extra-terrestrial life, and monitoring stars to help better understand our Sun. The featured composite includes foreground and background images taken in April from a mountaintop on La Palma island in the Canary Islands of Spain.  Pictured, several telescopes from the Roque de los Muchachos Observatory are shown in front of a dark night sky. Telescopes in the foreground include, left to right, Magic 1, Galileo, Magic 2, Gran Telescopio Canarias, and LST. Sky highlights in the background include the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy, the constellations of Sagittarius, Ophiuchus and Scorpius, the red-glowing Eagle and Lagoon Nebulas, and the stars Alrami and Antares.

Chandrayaan-3 Launches to the Moon,"Birds don't fly this high.  Airplanes don't go this fast.  The Statue of Liberty weighs less.  No species other than human can even comprehend what is going on, nor could any human just a millennium ago. The launch of a rocket bound for space is an event that inspires awe and challenges description.  Pictured here last week, the Indian Space Research Organization's  LVM3 rocket blasted off from the Satish Dhawan Space Centre on Sriharikota Island, India.  From a standing start, the 600,000+ kilogram rocket ship lifted the massive Chandrayaan-3 off the Earth. The Chandrayaan-3 mission is scheduled to reach the Moon in late August and land a robotic rover near the lunar South Pole.

M64: The Black Eye Galaxy Close Up,"This magnificent spiral galaxy is Messier 64, often called the Black Eye Galaxy or the Sleeping Beauty Galaxy for its dark-lidded appearance in telescopic views. The spiral's central region, about 7,400 light-years across, is pictured in this reprocessed image from the Hubble Space Telescope. M64 lies some 17 million light-years distant in the otherwise well-groomed northern constellation Coma Berenices. The enormous dust clouds partially obscuring M64's central region are laced with young, blue star clusters and the reddish glow of hydrogen associated with star forming regions.  But imposing clouds of dust are not this galaxy's only peculiar feature. Observations show that M64 is actually composed of two concentric, counter-rotating systems. While all the stars in M64 rotate in the same direction as the interstellar gas in the galaxy's central region, gas in the outer regions, extending to about 40,000 light-years, rotates in the opposite direction. The dusty eye and bizarre rotation are likely the result of a billion year old merger of two different galaxies.","black, galaxy, close, magnificent, spiral, messier, called, sleeping, beauty, dark-lidded, appearance, telescopic, view, central, region, light-year, pictured, reprocessed, image, hubble, space, telescope, distant, otherwise, well-groomed, northern, constellation, coma, berenices, enormous, dust, cloud, obscuring, laced, young, blue, star, cluster, reddish, glow, hydrogen, associated, forming, imposing, peculiar, feature, observation, show, composed, concentric, counter-rotating, system, rotate, direction, interstellar, outer, extending, rotates, opposite, dusty, bizarre, rotation, likely, result, year, merger, different"
Galactic Cirrus: Mandel Wilson 9,"The combined light of stars along the Milky Way are reflected by these cosmic dust clouds that soar 300 light-years or so above the plane of our galaxy. Known to some as integrated flux nebulae and commonly found at high galactic latitudes, the dusty galactic cirrus clouds are faint. But they can be traced over large regions of the sky toward the North and South Galactic poles. Along with the reflection of starlight, studies indicate the dust clouds produce a faint reddish luminescence as interstellar dust grains convert invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. Also capturing nearby Milky Way stars and distant background galaxies, this remarkably deep, wide-field image explores a complex of faint galactic cirrus known as Mandel Wilson 9. It spans over three degrees across planet Earth's skies toward the far southern constellation Apus.","galactic, cirrus, mandel, wilson, combined, light, star, milky, reflected, cosmic, dust, cloud, soar, light-year, plane, galaxy, known, integrated, flux, nebula, found, high, latitude, dusty, faint, traced, large, region, north, south, pole, reflection, starlight, study, indicate, produce, reddish, luminescence, interstellar, grain, convert, invisible, ultraviolet, radiation, visible, capturing, distant, background, deep, wide-field, image, explores, complex, span, degree, planet, earth, southern, constellation, apus"
Apollo 11: Armstrong's Lunar Selfie,"A photograph of Buzz Aldrin standing on the Moon taken by Neil Armstrong, was digitally reversed to create this lunar selfie. Captured in July 1969 following the Apollo 11 moon landing, Armstrong's original photograph recorded not only the magnificent desolation of an unfamiliar world, but Armstrong himself reflected in Aldrin's curved visor.  In the unwrapped image, the spherical distortion of the reflection in Aldrin's helmet has been reversed.  The transformed view features Armstrong himself from Aldrin's perspective. Since Armstrong took the original picture, today the image represents a fifty-four year old lunar selfie.  Aldrin's visor reflection in the original image appears here on the left. Bright (but distorted) planet Earth hangs in the lunar sky above Armstrong's figure, toward the upper right. A foil-wrapped leg of the Eagle lander and Aldrin's long shadow stretching across the lunar surface are prominently visible.

The Antikythera Mechanism,"It does what?  No one knew that 2,000 years ago, the technology existed to build such a device.  The Antikythera mechanism, pictured, is now widely regarded as the first computer. Found at the bottom of the sea aboard a decaying Greek ship, its complexity prompted decades of study, and even today some of its functions likely remain unknown.  X-ray images of the device, however, have confirmed that a main function of its numerous clock-like wheels and gears is to create a portable, hand-cranked, Earth-centered, orrery of the sky, predicting future star and planet locations as well as lunar and solar eclipses.  The corroded core of the Antikythera mechanism's largest gear is featured, spanning about 13 centimeters, while the entire mechanism was 33 centimeters high, making it similar in size to a large book. Recently, modern computer modeling of missing components is allowing for the creation of a more complete replica of this surprising ancient machine.","antikythera, mechanism, knew, year, technology, existed, build, device, pictured, regarded, computer, found, bottom, decaying, greek, ship, complexity, prompted, decade, study, today, function, remain, unknown, x-ray, image, confirmed, main, numerous, clock-like, wheel, gear, create, portable, hand-cranked, earth-centered, orrery, predicting, future, star, planet, location, solar, eclipse, corroded, core, largest, featured, spanning, centimeter, entire, high, making, similar, size, large, book, modern, modeling, missing, component, allowing, creation, complete, replica, surprising, ancient, machine"
Chemicals Glow as a Meteor Disintegrates,"Meteors can be colorful. While the human eye usually cannot discern many colors, cameras often can. Pictured here is a fireball, a disintegrating meteor that was not only one of the brightest the photographer has ever seen, but colorful. The meteor was captured by chance in mid-July with a camera set up on Hochkar Mountain in Austria to photograph the central band of our Milky Way galaxy. The radiant grit, likely cast off by a comet or asteroid long ago, had the misfortune to enter Earth's atmosphere.  Colors in meteors usually originate from ionized chemical elements released as the meteor disintegrates, with blue-green typically originating from magnesium, calcium radiating violet, and nickel glowing green. Red, however, typically originates from energized nitrogen and oxygen in the Earth's atmosphere.  This bright meteoric fireball was gone in a flash -- less than a second -- but it left a wind-blown ionization trail that remained visible for almost a minute.","chemical, glow, meteor, disintegrates, colorful, human, discern, many, color, camera, pictured, fireball, disintegrating, brightest, photographer, seen, captured, chance, hochkar, mountain, photograph, central, band, milky, galaxy, radiant, grit, likely, cast, comet, misfortune, enter, earth, atmosphere, originate, ionized, element, released, blue-green, originating, magnesium, calcium, radiating, violet, nickel, glowing, green, originates, energized, nitrogen, oxygen, bright, meteoric, gone, flash, less, second, left, wind-blown, ionization, trail, remained, visible, minute"
The Eagle Nebula with X-ray Hot Stars,"What do the famous Eagle Nebula star pillars look like in X-ray light? To find out, NASA's orbiting Chandra X-ray Observatory peered in and through these interstellar mountains of star formation. It was found that in M16 the dust pillars themselves do not emit many X-rays, but a lot of small-but-bright X-ray sources became evident. These sources are shown as bright dots on the featured image which is a composite of exposures from Chandra (X-rays), XMM (X-rays), JWST (infrared), Spitzer (infrared), Hubble (visible), and the VLT (visible).  What stars produce these X-rays remains a topic of research, but some are hypothesized to be hot, recently-formed, low-mass stars, while others are thought to be hot, older, high-mass stars.  These X-ray hot stars are scattered around the frame -- the previously identified Evaporating Gaseous Globules (EGGS) seen in visible light are not currently hot enough to emit X-rays.","eagle, nebula, x-ray, star, famous, pillar, look, light, find, nasa, orbiting, chandra, observatory, peered, interstellar, mountain, formation, found, dust, emit, many, small-but-bright, source, became, evident, shown, bright, featured, image, composite, exposure, jwst, infrared, spitzer, hubble, visible, produce, remains, topic, research, hypothesized, recently-formed, low-mass, others, thought, older, high-mass, scattered, frame, identified, evaporating, gaseous, globule, seen"
IC 4628: The Prawn Nebula,"South of Antares, in the tail of the nebula-rich constellation Scorpius, lies emission nebula IC 4628. Nearby hot, massive stars, millions of years young, irradiate the nebula with invisible ultraviolet light, stripping electrons from atoms. The electrons eventually recombine with the atoms to produce the visible nebular glow, dominated by the red emission of hydrogen. At an estimated distance of 6,000 light-years, the region shown is about 250 light-years across, spanning over three full moons on the sky. The nebula is also cataloged as Gum 56 for Australian astronomer Colin Stanley Gum, but seafood-loving deep sky-enthusiasts might know this cosmic cloud as the Prawn Nebula.

Galaxies in the River,"Large galaxies grow by eating small ones. Even our own galaxy engages in a sort of galactic cannibalism, absorbing small galaxies that are too close and are captured by the Milky Way's gravity. In fact, the practice is common in the universe and illustrated by this striking pair of interacting galaxies from the banks of the southern constellation Eridanus, The River. Located over 50 million light years away, the large, distorted spiral NGC 1532 is seen locked in a gravitational struggle with dwarf galaxy NGC 1531, a struggle the smaller galaxy will eventually lose. Seen nearly edge-on, spiral NGC 1532 spans about 100,000 light-years. The merging galaxies are captured in this sharp image from the Dark Energy Camera mounted on the National Science Foundation’s Blanco 4-meter Telescope at Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory in Chile.

"Young Stars, Stellar Jets","High-speed outflows of molecular gas from a pair of actively forming young stars shine in infrared light, revealing themselves in this NIRcam image from the James Webb Space Telescope. Cataloged as HH (Herbig-Haro) 46/47, the young stars are lodged within a dark nebula that is largely opaque when viewed in visible light.  The pair lie at the center of the prominent reddish diffraction spikes in the NIRcam image.  Their energetic stellar jets extend for nearly a light-year, burrowing into the dark interstellar material.

Apollo 11: Catching Some Sun,"Bright sunlight glints as long dark shadows mark this image of the surface of the Moon. It was taken fifty-four years ago, July 20, 1969, by Apollo 11 astronaut Neil Armstrong, the first to walk on the lunar surface. Pictured is the mission's lunar module, the Eagle, and spacesuited lunar module pilot Buzz Aldrin. Aldrin is unfurling a long sheet of foil also known as the Solar Wind Composition Experiment. Exposed facing the Sun, the foil trapped particles streaming outward in the solar wind, catching a sample of material from the Sun itself.

Spiral Aurora over Icelandic Divide,"Admire the beauty but fear the beast. The beauty is the aurora overhead, here taking the form of a great green spiral, seen between picturesque clouds with the bright Moon to the side and stars in the background.  The beast is the wave of charged particles that creates the aurora but might, one day, impair civilization.  In 1859, following notable auroras seen all across the globe, a pulse of charged particles from a coronal mass ejection (CME) associated with a solar flare impacted Earth's magnetosphere so forcefully that it created the Carrington Event. This assault from the Sun compressed the Earth's magnetic field so violently that it created high currents and sparks along telegraph wires, shocking many telegraph operators.  Were a Carrington-class event to impact the Earth today, speculation holds that damage might occur to global power grids and electronics on a scale never yet experienced.

Phobos over Mars,"Why is Phobos so dark?  Phobos, the largest and innermost of the two Martian moons, is the darkest moon in the entire Solar System.  Its unusual orbit and color indicate that it may be a captured asteroid composed of a mixture of ice and dark rock.  The featured assigned-color picture of Phobos near the edge of Mars was captured in late 2021 by ESA's robot spacecraft Mars Express, currently orbiting Mars.  Phobos is a heavily cratered and barren moon, with its largest crater located on the far side.  From images like this, Phobos has been determined to be covered by perhaps a meter of loose dust.  Phobos orbits so close to Mars that from some places it would appear to rise and set twice a day, while from other places it would not be visible at all.  Phobos' orbit around Mars is continually decaying -- it will likely break up with pieces crashing to the Martian surface in about 50 million years.

Monster Solar Prominence,"The monsters that live on the Sun are not like us. They are larger than the Earth and made of gas hotter than in any teapot. They have no eyes, but at times, many tentacles. They float.  Usually, they slowly change shape and just fade back onto the Sun over about a month. Sometimes, though, they suddenly explode and unleash energetic particles into the Solar System that can attack the Earth.  Pictured is a huge solar prominence imaged almost two weeks ago in the light of hydrogen. Captured by a small telescope in Gilbert, Arizona, USA, the monsteresque plume of gas was held aloft by the ever-present but ever-changing magnetic field near the surface of the Sun.

M82: Galaxy with a Supergalactic Wind,"Why is the Cigar Galaxy billowing red smoke?  M82, as this starburst galaxy is also known, was stirred up by a recent pass near large spiral galaxy M81.  This doesn't fully explain the source of the red-glowing outwardly expanding gas and dust, however.  Evidence indicates that this gas and dust is being driven out by the combined emerging particle winds of many stars, together creating a galactic superwind.  The dust particles are thought to originate in M82's interstellar medium and are actually similar in size to particles in cigar smoke.  The featured photographic mosaic highlights a specific color of red light strongly emitted by ionized hydrogen gas, showing detailed filaments of this gas and dust.  The filaments extend for over 10,000 light years.

Beyond the Redstone, the 8 minute long exposure has captured the arcing launch streak of a SpaceX Falcon Heavy rocket. The Falcon's heavy communications satellite payload, at a record setting 9 metric tons, is bound for geosynchronous orbit some 22,000 miles above planet Earth. The historic launch of a Redstone rocket carried astronaut Alan Shepard on a suborbital spaceflight in May 1961 to an altitude of about 116 miles.

Moonrays of August,"A Full Moon rose as the Sun set on August 1. Near perigee, the closest point in its almost moonthly orbit, the brighter than average lunar disk illuminated night skies around planet Earth as the second supermoon of 2023. Seen here above Ragusa, Sicily, cloud banks cast diverging shadows through the supermoonlit skies, creating dramatic lunar crepuscular rays. The next Full Moon in 2023 will also shine on an August night. Rising as the Sun sets on August 30/31, this second Full Moon in a month is known as a Blue Moon. Blue moons occur only once every 2 or 3 years because lunar phases take almost a calendar month (29.5 days) to go through a complete cycle. But August's Blue Moon will also be near perigee, the third supermoon in 2023.","moonrays, august, full, moon, rose, perigee, closest, point, moonthly, orbit, brighter, average, lunar, disk, illuminated, night, planet, earth, second, supermoon, seen, ragusa, cloud, bank, cast, diverging, shadow, supermoonlit, creating, dramatic, crepuscular, next, shine, rising, month, known, blue, occur, year, phase, take, calendar, complete, cycle, third"
NGC 1360: The Robin's Egg Nebula,"This pretty nebula lies some 1,500 light-years away, its shape and color in this telescopic view reminiscent of a robin's egg. The cosmic cloud spans about 3 light-years, nestled securely within the boundaries of the southern constellation Fornax. Recognized as a planetary nebula, egg-shaped NGC 1360 doesn't represent a beginning though. Instead it corresponds to a brief and final phase in the evolution of an aging star. In fact, visible at the center of the nebula, the central star of NGC 1360 is known to be a binary star system likely consisting of two evolved white dwarf stars, less massive but much hotter than the Sun.  Their intense and otherwise invisible ultraviolet radiation has stripped away electrons from the atoms in their mutually surrounding gaseous shroud. The predominant blue-green hue of NGC 1360 seen here is the strong emission produced as electrons recombine with doubly ionized oxygen atoms.","robin, nebula, light-year, shape, color, telescopic, view, reminiscent, cosmic, cloud, span, nestled, boundary, southern, constellation, fornax, recognized, planetary, egg-shaped, represent, beginning, corresponds, brief, final, phase, evolution, aging, star, fact, visible, center, central, known, binary, system, likely, consisting, evolved, white, dwarf, massive, much, hotter, intense, invisible, ultraviolet, radiation, stripped, electron, atom, surrounding, gaseous, shroud, predominant, blue-green, seen, strong, emission, produced, recombine, ionized, oxygen"
SN 1006: A Supernova Ribbon from Hubble,"What created this unusual space ribbon?  The answer: one of the most violent explosions ever witnessed by ancient humans. Back in the year 1006 AD, light reached Earth from a stellar explosion in the constellation of the Wolf (Lupus), creating a ""guest star"" in the sky that appeared brighter than Venus and lasted for over two years. The supernova, now cataloged at SN 1006, occurred about 7,000 light years away and has left a large remnant that continues to expand and fade today.  Pictured here is a small part of that expanding supernova remnant dominated by a thin and outwardly moving shock front that heats and ionizes surrounding ambient gas. The supernova remnant SN 1006 now has a diameter of nearly 60 light years.","supernova, ribbon, hubble, created, unusual, space, answer, violent, explosion, witnessed, ancient, human, year, light, reached, earth, stellar, constellation, wolf, lupus, creating, guest, star, appeared, brighter, venus, lasted, cataloged, occurred, left, large, remnant, continues, expand, fade, today, pictured, small, part, expanding, dominated, thin, moving, shock, front, heat, ionizes, surrounding, ambient, diameter"
"The Pelican Nebula in Gas, Dust, and Stars","The Pelican Nebula is slowly being transformed.  IC 5070 (the official designation) is divided from the larger North America Nebula by a molecular cloud filled with dark dust.  The Pelican, however, receives much study because it is a particularly active mix of star formation and evolving gas clouds.  The featured picture was produced in three specific colors -- light emitted by sulfur, hydrogen, and oxygen --  that can help us to better understand these interactions.  The light from young energetic stars is slowly transforming the cold gas to hot gas, with the advancing boundary between the two, known as an ionization front, visible in bright orange on the right. Particularly dense tentacles of cold gas remain.  Millions of years from now, the Pelican nebula, bounded by dark nebula LDN 935, might no longer be known as the Pelican, as the balance and placement of stars and gas will surely leave something that appears completely different.","pelican, nebula, dust, star, transformed, official, designation, divided, larger, north, america, molecular, cloud, filled, dark, receives, much, study, active, formation, evolving, featured, picture, produced, specific, color, light, emitted, sulfur, hydrogen, oxygen, help, better, understand, interaction, young, energetic, transforming, cold, advancing, boundary, known, ionization, front, visible, bright, orange, dense, tentacle, remain, year, bounded, balance, placement, leave, something, appears, different"
Moon Meets Jupiter,"What's that below the Moon? Jupiter -- and its largest moons.  Many skygazers across planet Earth enjoyed the close conjunction of Earth's Moon passing nearly in front of Jupiter in mid-June. The featured image is a single exposure of the event taken from Morón de la Frontera, Spain. The sunlit lunar crescent on the left is overexposed, while the Moon's night side, on the right, is only faintly illuminated by Earthshine. Lined up diagonally below the Moon, left to right, are Jupiter's bright Galilean satellites: Callisto, Ganymede, Io (hard to see as it is very near to Jupiter), and Europa.  In fact, Callisto, Ganymede, and Io are larger than Earth's Moon, while Europa is only slightly smaller. NASA's robotic spacecraft Juno is currently orbiting Jupiter and made a close pass near Io only a week ago.  If you look up in the night sky tonight, you will again see two of the brightest objects angularly close together -- because tonight is another Moon-Jupiter conjunction.","moon, meet, jupiter, largest, many, skygazers, planet, earth, enjoyed, close, conjunction, passing, front, mid-june, featured, image, single, exposure, event, taken, spain, sunlit, lunar, crescent, left, overexposed, night, side, illuminated, earthshine, lined, right, bright, galilean, satellite, callisto, ganymede, hard, europa, fact, larger, smaller, nasa, robotic, spacecraft, juno, orbiting, made, week, look, tonight, brightest, object, moon-jupiter"
Meteor Shower: Perseids from Perseus,"This is a good week to see meteors.  Comet dust will rain down on planet Earth, streaking through dark skies during peak nights of the annual Perseid Meteor Shower.  The featured composite image was taken during the 2018 Perseids from the Poloniny Dark Sky Park in Slovakia.  The dome of the observatory in the foreground is on the grounds of Kolonica Observatory. Although the comet dust particles travel parallel to each other, the resulting shower meteors clearly seem to radiate from a single point on the sky in the eponymous constellation Perseus.  The radiant effect is due to perspective, as the parallel tracks appear to converge at a distance, like train tracks.  The Perseid Meteor Shower is expected to reach its highest peak on Saturday after midnight.  Since a crescent Moon will rise only very late that night, cloudless skies will be darker than usual, making a high number of faint meteors potentially visible this year.","meteor, shower, perseids, good, week, comet, dust, rain, planet, earth, streaking, dark, peak, night, annual, perseid, featured, composite, image, taken, poloniny, park, slovakia, dome, observatory, foreground, ground, kolonica, particle, travel, resulting, seem, radiate, single, point, eponymous, constellation, perseus, radiant, effect, perspective, parallel, track, appear, converge, distance, train, expected, reach, highest, saturday, midnight, crescent, moon, rise, cloudless, darker, usual, making, high, number, faint, visible, year"
Five Meters over Mars,"On mission sol 872 (Earth date August 3) Ingenuity snapped this sharp image on its 54th flight above the surface of the Red Planet. During the flight the Mars Helicopter hovered about 5 meters, or just over 16 feet, above the Jezero crater floor. Tips of Ingenuity's landing legs peek over the left and right edges in the camera's field of view. Tracks visible near the upper right corner lead to the Perseverance Mars Rover, seen looking on from a distance at the top right edge of the frame. Planned as a brief ""pop-up"" flight, Ingenuity's 54th flight lasted less than 25 seconds. It followed Ingenuity's 53rd flight made on July 22 that resulted in an unscheduled landing.","meter, mission, earth, date, august, ingenuity, snapped, sharp, image, flight, surface, planet, helicopter, hovered, foot, jezero, crater, floor, landing, peek, left, right, edge, camera, field, view, track, visible, upper, corner, lead, perseverance, rover, seen, looking, distance, frame, planned, brief, pop-up, 54th, lasted, less, second, followed, made, july, resulted, unscheduled"
Messier 51 in 255 Hours,"An intriguing pair of interacting galaxies, M51 is the 51st entry in Charles Messier's famous catalog. Perhaps the original spiral nebula, the large galaxy with whirlpool-like spiral structure seen nearly face-on is also cataloged as NGC 5194. Its spiral arms and dust lanes sweep in front of a companion galaxy (right), NGC 5195. Some 31 million light-years distant, within the boundaries of the well-trained constellation Canes Venatici, M51 looks faint and fuzzy to the eye in direct telescopic views. But this remarkably deep image shows off stunning details of the galaxy pair's striking colors and extensive tidal debris. A collaboration of astro-imagers using telescopes on planet Earth combined over 10 days of exposure time to create this definitive galaxy portrait of M51. The image includes 118 hours of narrowband data that also reveals a vast glowing cloud of reddish ionized hydrogen gas discovered in the M51 system.

Ghirigori - Star Scribbles,"It's fun to scribble on the canvas of the sky. You can use a creative photographic technique to cause the light of point-like stars to dance across a digital image by tapping lightly on the telescope while making an exposure. The result will be a squiggly line traced by the star (or two squiggles traced by binary stars) that can reveal the star's color. Colorful lines, dubbed Ghirigori, made from stars found in the northern sky constellations Bootes, Corona Borealis, Ophiucus, and Coma Berenices, are captured in this artistic mosaic. The 25 stars creating the varied and colorful squiggles are identified around the border. Of course, temperature determines the color of a star. While whitish stars tend to be close to the Sun's temperature, stars with bluer hues are hotter, and yellow and red colors are cooler than the Sun.

The Sombrero Galaxy in Infrared,"This floating ring is the size of a galaxy.  In fact, it is a galaxy -- or at least part of one: the photogenic Sombrero Galaxy, one of the largest galaxies in the nearby Virgo Cluster of Galaxies.  The dark band of dust that obscures the mid-section of the Sombrero Galaxy in optical light actually glows brightly in infrared light.  The featured image, digitally sharpened, shows the infrared glow, recently recorded by the orbiting Spitzer Space Telescope, superposed in false-color on an existing image taken by NASA's Hubble Space Telescope in visible light. The Sombrero Galaxy, also known as M104, spans about 50,000 light years across and lies 28 million light years away.

The Ring Nebula from Webb and Hubble,"The Ring Nebula (M57), is more complicated than it appears through a small telescope.  The easily visible central ring is about one light-year across, but this remarkable combined exposure by the James Webb Space Telescope and the Hubble Space Telescope explores this popular nebula with  deep exposures in visible and infrared light. Strings of gas, like eyelashes around a cosmic eye, become evident around the Ring in this digitally enhanced featured image in assigned colors. These long filaments may be caused by shadowing of knots of dense gas in the ring from energetic light emitted within. The Ring Nebula is an elongated planetary nebula, a type of gas cloud created when a Sun-like star evolves to throw off its outer atmosphere to become a white dwarf star.  The central oval in the Ring Nebula lies about 2,500 light-years away toward the musical constellation Lyra.","ring, nebula, webb, hubble, complicated, appears, small, telescope, visible, central, light-year, remarkable, combined, exposure, james, space, explores, popular, deep, infrared, light, string, eyelash, cosmic, become, evident, enhanced, featured, image, assigned, color, filament, caused, shadowing, knot, dense, energetic, emitted, elongated, planetary, type, cloud, created, sun-like, star, evolves, throw, white, dwarf, oval, musical, constellation, lyra"
A Triply Glowing Night Sky over Iceland,"The Sun is not the quiet place it seems.  It expels an unsteady stream of energetic electrons and protons known as the solar wind.  These charged particles deform the Earth's magnetosphere, change paths, and collide with atoms in Earth's atmosphere, causing the generation of light in auroras like that visible in green in the image left.  Earth itself is also geologically active and covered with volcanoes. For example, Fagradalsfjall volcano in Iceland, seen emitting hot gas in orange near the image center. Iceland is one of the most geologically active places on Earth. On the far right is the Svartsengi geothermal power plant which creates the famous human-made Blue Lagoon, shown emitting white gas plumes.

Arp 93: A Cosmic Embrace,"Locked in a cosmic embrace, two large galaxies are merging at the center of this sharp telescopic field of view. The interacting system cataloged as Arp 93 is some 200 million light-years distant toward the constellation Aquarius in planet Earth's sky. Individually the galaxies are identified as NGC 7285 (right) and NGC 7284. Their bright cores are still separated by about 20,000 light-years or so, but a massive tidal stream, a result of their ongoing gravitational interaction, extends over 200,000 light-years toward the bottom of the frame. Interacting galaxies do look peculiar, but are now understood to be common in the Universe. In fact, closer to home, the large spiral Andromeda Galaxy is known to be approaching the Milky Way. Arp 93 may well present an analog of their distant future cosmic embrace.

A Cosmic Zoo in Cepheus,"Sprawling emission nebulae IC 1396 and Sh2-129 mix glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds in this nearly 12 degree wide field of view toward the northern constellation Cepheus the King. Energized by its central star IC 1396 (left), is hundreds of light-years across and some 3,000 light-years distant. The nebula's intriguing dark shapes include a winding dark cloud popularly known as the Elephant's Trunk below and right of center. Tens of light-years long, it holds the raw material for star formation and is known to hide protostars within. Located a similar distance from planet Earth, the bright knots and swept back ridges of emission of Sh2-129 on the right suggest its popular name, the Flying Bat Nebula. Within the Flying Bat, the most recently recognized addition to this royal cosmic zoo is the faint bluish emission from Ou4, the Giant Squid Nebula.

Northern Pluto,"Gaze across the frozen canyons of northern Pluto in this contrast enhanced color scene. The image data used to construct it was acquired in July 2015 by the New Horizons spacecraft as it made the first reconnaissance flight through the remote Pluto system six billion kilometers from the Sun. Now known as Lowell Regio, the region was named for Percival Lowell, founder of the Lowell Observatory. Also famous for his speculation that there were canals on Mars, Lowell started the search that ultimately led to Pluto's discovery in 1930 by Clyde Tombaugh. In this frame Pluto's North Pole is above and left of center. The pale bluish floor of the broad canyon on the left is about 70 kilometers (45 miles) wide, running vertically toward the south. Higher elevations take on a yellowish hue. New Horizon's measurements were used to determine that in addition to nitrogen ice, methane ice is abundant across Lowell Regio. So far, Pluto is the only Solar System world named by an 11-year-old girl.","northern, pluto, gaze, frozen, canyon, contrast, enhanced, color, scene, image, data, used, construct, acquired, horizon, spacecraft, made, first, reconnaissance, flight, remote, system, kilometer, known, regio, region, named, percival, lowell, founder, observatory, famous, speculation, canal, started, search, discovery, clyde, frame, north, pole, left, center, pale, bluish, floor, broad, mile, wide, running, south, higher, elevation, take, yellowish, measurement, determine, addition, nitrogen, methane, abundant, solar, world, 11-year-old, girl"
Ringed Ice Giant Neptune,"Ringed ice giant Neptune lies near the center of this sharp near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope. The dim and distant world is the farthest planet from the Sun, about 30 times farther away than planet Earth. But in the stunning Webb view, the planet's dark and ghostly appearance is due to atmospheric methane that absorbs infrared light. High altitude clouds that reach above most of Neptune's absorbing methane easily stand out in the image though. Coated with frozen nitrogen, Neptune's largest moon Triton is brighter than Neptune in reflected sunlight, seen at the upper left sporting the Webb telescope's characteristic diffraction spikes. Including Triton, seven of Neptune's 14 known moons can be identified in the field of view. Neptune's faint rings are striking in this space-based planetary portrait. Details of the complex ring system are seen here for the first time since Neptune was visited by the Voyager 2 spacecraft in August 1989.","ringed, giant, neptune, center, sharp, near-infrared, image, james, webb, space, telescope, distant, world, farthest, planet, time, farther, earth, stunning, view, dark, atmospheric, methane, absorbs, infrared, light, high, altitude, cloud, reach, absorbing, stand, coated, frozen, nitrogen, largest, moon, triton, brighter, reflected, sunlight, seen, upper, left, sporting, characteristic, diffraction, spike, including, known, identified, field, faint, ring, striking, space-based, planetary, portrait, detail, complex, system, first, visited, spacecraft, august"
A Roll Cloud Over Wisconsin,"What kind of cloud is this?  A type of arcus cloud called a roll cloud.  These rare long clouds may form near advancing cold fronts.   In particular, a downdraft from an advancing storm front can cause moist warm air to rise, cool below its dew point, and so form a cloud.  When this happens uniformly along an extended front, a roll cloud may form.  Roll clouds may actually have air circulating along the long horizontal axis of the cloud.  A roll cloud is not thought to be able to morph into a tornado.  Unlike a similar shelf cloud, a roll cloud is completely detached from their parent  cumulonimbus cloud.  Pictured here, a roll cloud extends far into the distance as a storm approaches in 2007 in Racine, Wisconsin, USA.","roll, cloud, wisconsin, kind, type, arcus, called, rare, long, form, advancing, cold, front, particular, downdraft, storm, cause, moist, rise, cool, point, happens, extended, circulating, horizontal, axis, thought, able, morph, tornado, similar, shelf, detached, parent, cumulonimbus, pictured, extends, distance, approach, racine"
Introducing Comet Nishimura,"Will Comet Nishimura become visible to the unaided eye? Given the unpredictability of comets, no one can say for sure, but it currently seems like a good bet.  The comet was discovered only ten days ago by Hideo Nishimura during 30-second exposures with a standard digital camera.  Since then, C/2023 P1 Nishimura has increased in brightness and its path across the inner Solar System determined.  As the comet dives toward the Sun, it will surely continue to intensify and possibly become a naked-eye object in early September.  A problem is that the comet will also be angularly near the Sun, so it will only be possible to see it near sunset or sunrise.  The comet will get so close to the Sun -- inside the orbit of planet Mercury -- that its nucleus may break up. Pictured, Comet Nishimura was imaged three days ago from June Lake, California, USA while sporting a green coma and a thin tail.","introducing, comet, nishimura, become, visible, unaided, given, unpredictability, sure, seems, good, discovered, hideo, 30-second, exposure, standard, digital, camera, c/2023, increased, brightness, path, inner, solar, system, determined, dive, continue, intensify, naked-eye, object, early, september, problem, possible, sunset, sunrise, close, orbit, planet, mercury, nucleus, break, pictured, imaged, june, lake, california, sporting, green, coma, thin, tail"
The Pistachio Nebula,"This nebula had never been noted before. Newly discovered nebulas are usually angularly small and found by professionals using large telescopes. In contrast, the Pistachio Nebula was discovered by dedicated amateurs and, although faint, is nearly the size of the full Moon.  In modern times, amateurs with even small telescopes can create long exposures over sky areas much larger than most professional telescopes can see.  They can therefore discover both previously unknown areas of extended emission around known objects, as well as entirely unknown objects, like nebulas.  The pictured Pistachio Nebula is shown in oxygen emission (blue) and hydrogen emission (red).  The nature of the hot central star is currently unknown, and the nebula might be labeled a planetary nebula if it turns out to be a white dwarf star.  The featured image is a composite of over 70 hours of exposure taken in early June under the dark skies of Namibia.","pistachio, nebula, noted, discovered, small, found, professional, using, large, telescope, contrast, dedicated, amateur, faint, size, full, moon, modern, time, create, long, exposure, area, larger, unknown, extended, emission, known, object, well, pictured, shown, oxygen, blue, hydrogen, nature, central, star, labeled, planetary, turn, white, dwarf, featured, image, composite, hour, taken, early, june, dark, namibia"
The Meteor and the Galaxy,"It came from outer space. It -- in this case a sand-sized bit of a comet nucleus -- was likely ejected many years ago from Sun-orbiting Comet Swift-Tuttle, but then continued to orbit the Sun alone.  When the Earth crossed through this orbit, the piece of comet debris impacted the atmosphere of our fair planet and was seen as a meteor. This meteor deteriorated, causing gases to be emitted that glowed in colors emitted by its component elements. The featured image was taken last week from Castilla La Mancha, Spain, during the peak night of the Perseids meteor shower.  The picturesque meteor streak happened to appear in the only one of 50 frames that also included the Andromeda galaxy. Stars dot the frame, each much further away than the meteor. Compared to the stars, the Andromeda galaxy (M31) is, again, much further away.","meteor, galaxy, came, space, case, sand-sized, comet, nucleus, ejected, many, year, sun-orbiting, swift-tuttle, continued, orbit, earth, crossed, piece, impacted, fair, planet, seen, deteriorated, causing, emitted, glowed, color, component, element, featured, image, taken, last, week, castilla, spain, peak, night, perseids, shower, picturesque, streak, happened, appear, frame, included, andromeda, star, much, compared"
Meteors along the Milky Way,"Under dark and mostly moonless night skies, many denizens of planet Earth were able to watch this year's Perseid meteor shower. Seen from a grassy hillside from Shiraz, Iran these Perseid meteors streak along the northern summer Milky Way before dawn on Sunday, August 13. Frames used to construct the composited image were captured near the active annual meteor shower's peak between 02:00 AM and 04:30 AM local time. Not in this night skyscape, the shower's radiant in the heroic constellation Perseus is far above the camera's field of view. But fans of northern summer nights can still spot a familiar asterism. Formed by bright stars Deneb, Vega, and Altair, the Summer Triangle spans the luminous band of the Milky Way.","meteor, milky, dark, moonless, night, many, denizen, planet, earth, able, watch, year, perseid, shower, seen, grassy, hillside, shiraz, iran, streak, northern, summer, dawn, sunday, august, frame, used, construct, composited, image, captured, active, annual, peak, local, time, skyscape, radiant, heroic, constellation, perseus, camera, field, view, spot, familiar, asterism, formed, bright, star, deneb, vega, altair, span, luminous, band"
A Season of Saturn,"Ringed planet Saturn will be at its 2023 opposition, opposite the Sun in Earth's skies, on August 27. While that puts the sixth planet from the Sun at its brightest and well-placed for viewing, its beautiful ring system isn't visible to the unaided eye. Still, this sequence of six telescopic images taken a year apart follows both Saturn and rings as seen from inner planet Earth. The gas giant's ring plane tilts from most open in 2018 to approaching edge-on in 2023 (top to bottom). That's summer to nearly the autumn equinox for Saturn's northern hemisphere. In the sharp planetary portraits Saturn's northern hexagon and a large storm system are clearly visible in 2018. In 2023 ice moon Tethys is transiting, casting its shadow across southern hemisphere cloud bands while Saturn's cold blue south pole is emerging from almost a decade of winter darkness.","season, saturn, ringed, planet, opposition, opposite, earth, august, sixth, brightest, well-placed, viewing, beautiful, ring, system, visible, unaided, sequence, telescopic, image, taken, year, follows, seen, inner, giant, plane, tilt, open, approaching, edge-on, bottom, summer, autumn, equinox, northern, sharp, planetary, portrait, hexagon, large, storm, moon, tethys, transiting, casting, shadow, southern, cloud, band, cold, blue, south, pole, emerging, decade, winter, darkness"
Crescents of Venus,"Just as the Moon goes through phases, Venus' visible sunlit hemisphere waxes and wanes. This sequence of telescopic images illustrates the steady changes for Venus during its recent 2023 apparition as our evening star. Gliding along its interior orbit between Earth and Sun, Venus grows larger during that period because it is approaching planet Earth. Its crescent narrows though, as the inner planet swings closer to our line-of-sight to the Sun. Closest to the Earth-Sun line but passing about 8 degrees south of the Sun, on August 13 Venus reached its (non-judgmental) inferior conjunction. And now Venus shines above the eastern horizon in predawn skies, completing its transition to planet Earth's morning star. On August 21, NASA's Parker Solar Probe completed its sixth gravity assist flyby of Venus, using the encounter to maneuver the probe toward its closest approach yet to the Sun.","crescent, venus, moon, phase, visible, sunlit, wane, sequence, telescopic, image, illustrates, steady, change, recent, apparition, evening, star, gliding, interior, orbit, earth, grows, larger, period, approaching, planet, narrow, inner, swing, closer, line-of-sight, closest, earth-sun, line, passing, degree, south, august, reached, non-judgmental, inferior, conjunction, shine, eastern, horizon, predawn, completing, transition, morning, nasa, parker, solar, probe, completed, sixth, gravity, assist, flyby, using, encounter, maneuver, approach"

Star Formation in the Pacman Nebula,"Look through the cosmic cloud cataloged as NGC 281 and you might miss the stars of open cluster IC 1590. Formed within the nebula, that cluster's young, massive stars ultimately power the pervasive nebular glow. The eye-catching shapes looming in the featured portrait of NGC 281 are sculpted dusty columns and dense Bok globules seen in silhouette, eroded by intense, energetic winds and radiation from the hot cluster stars. If they survive long enough, the dusty structures could also be sites of future star formation. Playfully called the Pacman Nebula because of its overall shape, NGC 281 is about 10,000 light-years away in the constellation Cassiopeia. This sharp composite image was made through narrow-band filters. It combines emission from the nebula's hydrogen and oxygen atoms to synthesize red, green, and blue colors.

Unusual Spiral Galaxy M66 from Webb,"Why isn't spiral galaxy M66 symmetric?  Usually, density waves of gas, dust, and newly formed stars circle a spiral galaxy's center and create a nearly symmetric galaxy.  The differences between M66's spiral arms and the apparent displacement of its nucleus are all likely caused by previous close interactions and the tidal gravitational pulls of nearby galaxy neighbors M65 and NGC 3628. The galaxy, featured here in infrared light taken by the James Webb Space Telescope, spans about 100,000 light years, lies about 35 million light years distant, and is the largest galaxy in a group known as the Leo Triplet.

Full Moons of August,"Near perigee, the closest point in its almost moonthly orbit, a Full Moon rose as the Sun set on August 1. Its brighter than average lunar disk was captured in this dramatic moonrise sequence over dense cloud banks along the eastern horizon from Ragusa, Sicily. Illuminating night skies around planet Earth it was the second supermoon of 2023. Yet again near perigee, the third supermoon of 2023 will also shine on an August night. Rising as the Sun sets tonight this second Full Moon in August will be known to some as a Blue Moon, even though scattered sunlight gives the lunar disk a reddened hue. Defined as the second full moon in a calendar month, blue moons occur only once every 2 or 3 years. That's because lunar phases take 29.5 days, almost a calendar month, to go through a complete cycle. Tonight an August Blue Moon will find itself beside bright planet Saturn.","full, moon, august, perigee, closest, point, moonthly, orbit, rose, brighter, average, lunar, disk, captured, dramatic, moonrise, sequence, dense, cloud, bank, eastern, horizon, ragusa, illuminating, night, planet, earth, second, supermoon, near, third, shine, rising, tonight, known, blue, scattered, sunlight, give, reddened, defined, calendar, month, occur, year, phase, take, complete, cycle, find, beside, bright, saturn"
The Crew-7 Nebula,"Not the James Webb Space Telescope's latest view of a distant galactic nebula, this illuminated cloud of gas and dust dazzled early morning spacecoast skygazers on August 26. The snapshot was taken about 2 minutes after the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket on the SpaceX Crew-7 mission, the seventh commercial crew rotation mission for the International Space Station. It captures drifting plumes and exhaust from the separated first and second stage illuminated against the still dark skies. Near the center of the image, within the ragged blueish ring, are two bright points of light. The lower one is the second stage of the rocket carrying 4 humans to space in a Crew Dragon spacecraft.

The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules,"In 1716, English astronomer Edmond Halley noted, ""This is but a little Patch, but it shows itself to the naked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent."" Of course, M13 is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, one of the brightest globular star clusters in the northern sky. Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core, upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away. The remarkable range of brightness recorded in this image follows stars into the dense cluster core.","great, globular, cluster, hercules, english, astronomer, edmond, halley, noted, little, patch, show, naked, serene, moon, absent, course, recognized, brightest, star, northern, sharp, telescopic, view, reveal, spectacular, hundred, distance, light-year, crowd, region, diameter, approaching, core, upwards, contained, cube, side, comparison, closest, remarkable, range, brightness, recorded, image, follows, dense"
NGC 7023: The Iris Nebula,"These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away in the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus. Called the Iris Nebula, NGC 7023 is not the only nebula to evoke the imagery of flowers. Still, this deep telescopic image shows off the Iris Nebula's range of colors and symmetries embedded in surrounding fields of interstellar dust. Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot, young star. The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish photoluminescence as some dust grains effectively convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. Infrared observations indicate that this nebula contains complex carbon molecules known as PAHs. The dusty blue petals of the Iris Nebula span about six light-years.","iris, nebula, cosmic, cloud, blossomed, light-year, fertile, starfields, constellation, cepheus, called, evoke, imagery, flower, deep, telescopic, image, show, range, color, symmetry, embedded, surrounding, field, interstellar, dust, dusty, nebular, material, surround, young, star, dominant, brighter, reflection, blue, characteristic, grain, reflecting, starlight, central, filament, glow, faint, reddish, photoluminescence, convert, invisible, ultraviolet, radiation, visible, light, infrared, observation, indicate, contains, complex, carbon, molecule, known, pahs, petal, span"
Comet Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 Fragments,"Periodic comet 73P/Schwassmann-Wachmann 3 has broken up at least twice. A cosmic souffle of ice and dust left over from the early solar system, this comet was first seen to split into several large pieces during the close-in part of its orbit in 1995.  However, in the 2006 passage, it disintegrated into dozens of fragments that stretched several degrees across the sky. Since comets are relatively fragile, stresses from heat, gravity and outgassing, for example, could be responsible for their tendency to break up in such a spectacular fashion when they near the hot Sun. The Hubble Space Telescope recorded, in 2006, the featured sharp view of prolific Fragment B, itself trailing a multitude of smaller pieces, each with its own cometary coma and tail. The picture spans over 3,000 kilometers at the comet's distance of 32 million kilometers from planet Earth.","comet, schwassmann-wachmann, fragment, periodic, 73p/schwassmann-wachmann, broken, least, cosmic, souffle, dust, left, early, solar, system, seen, split, several, large, piece, close-in, part, orbit, passage, disintegrated, dozen, stretched, degree, fragile, stress, heat, gravity, outgassing, example, responsible, tendency, break, spectacular, fashion, hubble, space, telescope, recorded, featured, sharp, view, prolific, trailing, multitude, smaller, cometary, coma, tail, picture, span, kilometer, distance, planet, earth"
Cygnus: Bubble and Crescent,"As stars die, they create clouds.  Two stellar death clouds of gas and dust can be found toward the high-flying constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) as they drift through rich star fields in the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy. Caught here within the telescopic field of view are the Soap Bubble (lower left) and the Crescent Nebula (upper right). Both were formed at the final phase in the life of a star. Also known as NGC 6888, the Crescent Nebula was shaped as its bright, central massive Wolf-Rayet star, WR 136, shed its outer envelope in a strong stellar wind. Burning through fuel at a prodigious rate, WR 136 is near the end of a short life that should finish in a spectacular supernova explosion.  Discovered in 2013, the Soap Bubble Nebula is likely a planetary nebula, the final shroud of a lower mass, long-lived, Sun-like star destined to become a slowly cooling white dwarf. Both stellar nebulas are about 5,000 light-years distant, with the larger Crescent Nebula spanning about 25 light-years across. Within a few million years, both will likely have dispersed.

Blue Supermoon Beyond Syracuse,"The last full moon was doubly unusual. First of all, it was a blue moon.  A modern definition of a blue moon is a second full moon to occur during one calendar month.  Since there are 13 full moons in 2023, one month has to have two -- and that month was August.  The first full moon was on August 1 and named a Sturgeon Moon. The second reason that the last full moon was unusual was because it was a supermoon.  A modern definition of supermoon is a moon that reaches its full phase when it is relatively close to Earth -- and so appears a bit larger and brighter than average.  Pictured, the blue supermoon of 2023 was imaged hovering far behind a historic castle and lighthouse in Syracuse, Sicily, Italy.

HESS Telescopes Explore the High-Energy Sky,"They may look like modern mechanical dinosaurs, but they are enormous swiveling eyes that watch the sky. The High Energy Stereoscopic System (H.E.S.S.) Observatory is composed of four 12-meter reflecting-mirror telescopes surrounding a larger telescope housing a 28-meter mirror. They are designed to detect strange flickers of blue light -- Cherenkov radiation --emitted when charged particles move slightly faster than the speed of light in air.  This light is emitted when a gamma ray from a distant source strikes a molecule in Earth's atmosphere and starts a charged-particle shower.  H.E.S.S. is sensitive to some of the highest energy photons (TeV) crossing the universe.  Operating since 2003 in Namibia, H.E.S.S. has searched for dark matter and has discovered over 50 sources emitting high energy radiation including supernova remnants and the centers of galaxies that contain supermassive black holes.

The Large Cloud of Magellan,"The 16th century Portuguese navigator Ferdinand Magellan and his crew had plenty of time to study the southern sky during the first circumnavigation of planet Earth. As a result, two fuzzy cloud-like objects easily visible to southern hemisphere skygazers are known as the Clouds of Magellan, now understood to be satellite galaxies of our much larger, spiral Milky Way galaxy. About 160,000 light-years distant in the constellation Dorado, the Large Magellanic Cloud is seen in this sharp galaxy portrait. Spanning about 15,000 light-years or so, it is the most massive of the Milky Way's satellite galaxies and is the home of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A.  The prominent patch above center is 30 Doradus, also known as the magnificent Tarantula Nebula, a giant star-forming region about 1,000 light-years across.","large, cloud, magellan, century, portuguese, navigator, ferdinand, crew, plenty, time, study, southern, first, circumnavigation, planet, earth, result, fuzzy, cloud-like, object, visible, hemisphere, skygazers, known, understood, satellite, galaxy, larger, spiral, milky, light-year, distant, constellation, dorado, magellanic, seen, sharp, portrait, spanning, massive, home, closest, supernova, modern, prominent, patch, center, doradus, magnificent, tarantula, nebula, giant, star-forming, region"

The sharp composite, color image highlights faint details of the region's gas and dust clouds against a backdrop of central Milky Way stars.

Comet Nishimura Grows,"Comet Nishimura is growing. More precisely, the tails C/2023 P1 (Nishimura) are growing as it nears the Sun. Discovered only last month, the comet is already near naked eye brightness as it now moves inside the Earth's orbit.  The comet will be nearest the Earth next week, but nearest the Sun the week after -- on September 17.  Speculation holds that expelled ice and dust from Comet Nishimura's last visit to the inner Solar System may have created the Sigma Hydrids meteor shower which peaks yearly in December.  If so, then this meteor shower may become more active, refreshed with new comet debris. Pictured, Comet Nishimura was captured from Edgewood, New Mexico, USA four nights ago, showing a long ion tail structured by interactions with the Sun's wind. Look for this comet near your eastern horizon just before sunrise for the next few mornings, but very near your western horizon just after sunset next week -- as its coma continues to brighten and its tails continue to grow.

An Annular Solar Eclipse over New Mexico,"What is this person doing?  In 2012, an annular eclipse of the Sun was visible over a narrow path that crossed the northern Pacific Ocean and several western US states.  In an annular solar eclipse, the Moon is too far from the Earth to block out the entire Sun, leaving the Sun peeking out over the Moon's disk in a ring of fire.  To capture this unusual solar event, an industrious photographer drove from Arizona to New Mexico to find just the right vista. After setting up and just as the eclipsed Sun was setting over a ridge about 0.5 kilometers away, a person unknowingly walked right into the shot. Although grateful for the unexpected human element, the photographer never learned the identity of the silhouetted interloper. It appears likely that the person is holding a circular device that would enable them to get their own view of the eclipse. The shot was taken at sunset on 2012 May 20 at 7:36 pm local time from a park near Albuquerque.  Next month, on October 14, a different narrow swath across North and South America will be exposed to a different annular solar eclipse, if the sky is clear. Simultaneously, cloud-free observers almost anywhere on either continent will be able to see a partial solar eclipse.","annular, solar, eclipse, mexico, person, visible, narrow, path, crossed, northern, pacific, ocean, several, western, state, moon, earth, block, entire, leaving, peeking, disk, ring, fire, capture, unusual, event, industrious, photographer, drove, find, right, vista, setting, eclipsed, ridge, kilometer, walked, shot, grateful, unexpected, human, element, learned, identity, silhouetted, interloper, appears, likely, holding, circular, device, enable, view, taken, sunset, local, time, park, albuquerque, next, month, october, different, swath, north, south, america, exposed, clear, cloud-free, observer, continent, able, partial"

Venus, by itself on the right, appears unusually exquisite, surrounded by a colorful atmospheric corona. But what attracts the eye most is the comet. On the left, in this composite image taken just before dawn yesterday morning, is Comet Nishimura.

Galaxy Cluster Abell 370 and Beyond,"Some 4 billion light-years away, massive galaxy cluster Abell 370 is captured in this sharp Hubble Space Telescope snapshot. The cluster of galaxies only appears to be dominated by two giant elliptical galaxies and infested with faint arcs. In reality, the fainter, scattered bluish arcs, along with the dramatic dragon arc below and left of center, are images of galaxies that lie far beyond Abell 370. About twice as distant, their otherwise undetected light is magnified and distorted by the cluster's enormous gravitational mass, overwhelmingly dominated by unseen dark matter. Providing a tantalizing glimpse of galaxies in the early universe, the effect is known as gravitational lensing. A consequence of warped spacetime, lensing was predicted by Einstein almost a century ago. Far beyond the spiky foreground Milky Way star at lower right, Abell 370 is seen toward the constellation Cetus, the Sea Monster. It was the last of six galaxy clusters imaged in the Frontier Fields project.","galaxy, cluster, abell, light-year, massive, captured, sharp, hubble, space, telescope, snapshot, appears, dominated, giant, elliptical, infested, faint, reality, fainter, scattered, bluish, dramatic, dragon, left, center, image, distant, undetected, light, magnified, distorted, enormous, gravitational, mass, unseen, dark, matter, providing, tantalizing, glimpse, early, universe, effect, known, lensing, consequence, warped, spacetime, predicted, century, spiky, foreground, milky, star, lower, right, seen, constellation, cetus, monster, last, imaged, frontier, field, project"
NGC 4632: Galaxy with a Hidden Polar Ring,"Galaxy NGC 4632 hides a secret from optical telescopes.  It is surrounded by a ring of cool hydrogen gas orbiting at 90 degrees to its spiral disk.  Such polar ring galaxies have previously been discovered using starlight.  However, NGC 4632 is among the first in which a radio telescope survey revealed a polar ring.  The featured composite image combines this gas ring, observed with the highly sensitive ASKAP telescope, with optical data from the Subaru telescope.  Using virtual reality, astronomers separated out the gas in the main disk of the galaxy from the ring, and the subtle color gradient traces its orbital motion.  Why do polar rings exist?  They could be material pulled from one galaxy as it gravitationally interacts with a companion.  Or hydrogen gas flows along the filaments of the cosmic web and accretes into a ring around a galaxy, some of which gravitationally contracts into stars.","galaxy, hidden, polar, ring, hide, secret, optical, telescope, surrounded, cool, hydrogen, orbiting, degree, spiral, disk, discovered, using, starlight, first, radio, survey, revealed, featured, composite, image, combine, observed, sensitive, askap, data, subaru, virtual, reality, astronomer, separated, main, subtle, color, gradient, trace, orbital, motion, exist, material, pulled, interacts, companion, flow, filament, cosmic, accretes, contract, star"
NGC 7331 and Beyond,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 7331 is often touted as an analog to our own Milky Way. About 50 million light-years distant in the northern constellation Pegasus, NGC 7331 was recognized early on as a spiral nebula and is actually one of the brighter galaxies not included in Charles Messier's famous 18th century catalog. Since the galaxy's disk is inclined to our line-of-sight, long telescopic exposures often result in images that evokes a strong sense of depth. The effect is further enhanced in this sharp image by galaxies that lie beyond the gorgeous island universe. The most prominent background galaxies are about one tenth the apparent size of NGC 7331 and so lie roughly ten times farther away. Their close alignment on the sky with NGC 7331 occurs just by chance. Lingering above the plane of the Milky Way, this striking visual grouping of galaxies is known to some as the Deer Lick Group.","beautiful, spiral, galaxy, touted, milky, light-year, distant, northern, constellation, pegasus, recognized, early, nebula, brighter, included, charles, famous, 18th, century, catalog, disk, inclined, line-of-sight, long, telescopic, exposure, result, image, evokes, strong, sense, depth, effect, enhanced, sharp, gorgeous, island, universe, prominent, background, tenth, apparent, size, time, close, alignment, occurs, chance, lingering, plane, striking, visual, grouping, known, deer, lick, group"

Venus, at the upper right, shared the early twilight with an old crescent Moon. Seen from this stratospheric perspective, mountain peaks and clouds appear in silhouette along a glowing eastern horizon.

Entertaining an intrepid group of aurora hunters during a geomagnetic storm, alluring northern lights dance across the darkened sky when a stunning fireball meteor explodes. Awestruck, the camera-equipped skygazers captured video and still images of the boreal bolide, at its peak about as bright as a full moon.

Moon Mountains Magnified during Ring of Fire Eclipse,"What are those dark streaks in this composite image of a solar eclipse? They are reversed shadows of mountains at the edge of the Moon.  The center image, captured from Xiamen, China, has the Moon's center directly in front of the Sun's center. The Moon, though, was too far from the Earth to completely block the entire Sun.  Light that streamed around the edges of the Moon is called a  ring of fire. Images at each end of the sequence show sunlight that streamed through lunar valleys.  As the Moon moved further in front of the Sun, left to right, only the higher peaks on the Moon's perimeter could block sunlight.  Therefore, the dark streaks are projected, distorted, reversed, and magnified shadows of mountains at the Moon's edge.  Bright areas are called Baily's Beads. Only people in a narrow swath across Earth's Eastern Hemisphere were able to view this full annular solar eclipse in 2020. Next month, though, a narrow swath crossing both North and South America will be exposed to the next annular solar eclipse. And next April, a total solar eclipse will be visible across North America.

The Red Sprite and the Tree,"The sprite and tree could hardly be more different. To start, the red sprite is an unusual form of lightning, while the tree is a common plant. The sprite is far away -- high in Earth's atmosphere, while the tree is nearby -- only about a football field away.  The sprite is fast -- electrons streaming up and down at near light's speed, while the tree is slow -- wood anchored to the ground. The sprite is bright -- lighting up the sky, while the tree is dim -- shining mostly by reflected light. The sprite was fleeting -- lasting only a small fraction of a second, while the tree is durable -- living now for many years.

HH 211: Jets from a Forming Star,"Do stars always create jets as they form? No one is sure. As a gas cloud gravitationally contracts, it forms a disk that can spin too fast to continue contracting into a protostar.  Theorists hypothesize that this spin can be reduced by expelling jets. This speculation coincides with known Herbig-Haro (HH) objects, young stellar objects seen to emit jets -- sometimes in spectacular fashion. Pictured is Herbig-Haro 211, a young star in formation recently imaged by the Webb Space Telescope (JWST) in infrared light and in great detail.  Along with the two narrow beams of particles, red shock waves can be seen as the outflows impact existing interstellar gas. The jets of HH 211 will likely change shape as they brighten and fade over the next 100,000 years, as research into the details of star formation continues.","forming, star, create, form, sure, cloud, contract, disk, spin, fast, continue, contracting, protostar, theorist, hypothesize, reduced, expelling, speculation, coincides, known, herbig-haro, object, young, stellar, seen, emit, spectacular, fashion, pictured, formation, imaged, webb, space, telescope, jwst, infrared, light, great, detail, narrow, beam, particle, shock, wave, outflow, impact, existing, interstellar, likely, change, shape, fade, next, year, research, continues"
Methane Discovered on Distant Exoplanet,"Where else might life exist?  One of humanity's great outstanding questions, locating planets where extrasolar life might survive took a step forward in 2019 with the discovery of a significant amount of water vapor in the atmosphere of distant exoplanet K2-18b. The planet and its parent star, K2-18, lie about 124 light years away toward the constellation of the Lion (Leo). The exoplanet is significantly larger and more massive than our Earth, but orbits in the habitable zone of its home star. K2-18, although more red than our Sun, shines in K2-18b's sky with a brightness similar to the Sun in Earth's sky.  The 2019 discovery of atmospheric water was made in data from three space telescopes: Hubble, Spitzer, and Kepler, by noting the absorption of water-vapor colors when the planet moved in front of the star.  Now in 2023, further observations by the Webb Space Telescope in infrared light have uncovered evidence of other life-indicating molecules -- including methane.  The featured illustration imagines exoplanet K2-18b on the far right orbited by a moon (center), which together orbit a red dwarf star depicted on the lower left.","methane, discovered, distant, exoplanet, life, exist, humanity, great, outstanding, question, locating, planet, extrasolar, survive, took, step, discovery, significant, amount, water, vapor, k2-18b, parent, star, k2-18, light, year, constellation, lion, larger, massive, earth, orbit, habitable, zone, home, shine, brightness, similar, atmospheric, made, data, space, telescope, hubble, spitzer, kepler, noting, absorption, water-vapor, color, moved, observation, webb, infrared, uncovered, evidence, life-indicating, molecule, including, featured, illustration, imago, orbited, moon, center, dwarf, depicted, lower, left"
Tagging Bennu,"The OSIRIS-REx spacecraft's arm reached out and touched asteroid 101955 Bennu on October 20, 2020, after a careful approach to the small, near-Earth asteroid's boulder-strewn surface. Dubbed a Touch-And-Go (TAG) sampling event, the 30 centimeter wide sampling head (TAGSAM) appears to crush some of the rocks in this close-up recorded by the spacecraft's SamCam. The image was snapped just after surface contact some 321 million kilometers from planet Earth. One second later, the spacecraft fired nitrogen gas from a bottle to blow a substantial amount of Bennu's regolith into the sampling head, collecting the loose surface material. And now, nearly three years later, on Sunday, September 24, that sample of asteroid Bennu is scheduled to arrive on planet Earth. The sample return capsule will be dropped off by the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft as it makes a close flyby of Earth. Twenty minutes after the drop-off, the spacecraft will fire its thrusters to divert past Earth and continue on to orbit near-Earth asteroid 99942 Apophis.","tagging, bennu, osiris-rex, spacecraft, reached, touched, asteroid, careful, approach, small, near-earth, boulder-strewn, surface, dubbed, touch-and-go, sampling, event, centimeter, wide, head, tagsam, appears, crush, rock, close-up, recorded, samcam, image, snapped, contact, kilometer, planet, earth, second, fired, nitrogen, bottle, substantial, amount, regolith, collecting, loose, material, year, sunday, september, sample, scheduled, arrive, return, capsule, dropped, make, close, flyby, twenty, minute, drop-off, fire, thruster, divert, continue, apophis"
Cosmos in Reflection,"During the day, over 12,000 large mirrors reflect sunlight at the 100-megawatt, molten-salt, solar thermal power plant at the western edge of the Gobi desert near Dunhuang, Gansu Province, China. Individual mirror panels turn to track the sun like sunflowers. They conspire to act as a single super mirror reflecting the sunlight toward a fixed position, the power station's central tower. During the night the mirrors stand motionless though. They reflect the light of the countless distant stars, clusters and nebulae of the Milky Way and beyond. This sci-fi night skyscape was created with a camera fixed to a tripod near the edge of the giant mirror matrix on September 15. The camera's combined sequence of digital exposures captures concentric arcs of celestial star trails through the night with star trails in surreal mirrored reflection.","cosmos, reflection, large, mirror, reflect, sunlight, 100-megawatt, molten-salt, solar, thermal, power, plant, western, edge, gobi, desert, dunhuang, gansu, province, china, individual, panel, turn, sunflower, conspire, single, super, reflecting, fixed, position, station, central, tower, night, stand, motionless, light, countless, distant, star, cluster, nebula, milky, sci-fi, skyscape, created, camera, tripod, giant, matrix, combined, sequence, digital, exposure, capture, concentric, celestial, trail, surreal, mirrored"
Afternoon Analemma,"An analemma is that figure-8 curve you get when you mark the position of the Sun at the same time each day for one year. To make this one, a 4x5 pinhole camera was set up looking north in southern New Zealand skies. The shutter was briefly opened each clear day in the afternoon at 4pm local time exposing the same photosensitized glass plate for the year spanning September 23, 2022 to September 19, 2023. On two days, the winter and summer solstices, the shutter was opened again 15 minutes after the main exposure and remained open until sunset to create the sun trails at the bottom and top of the curve. The equinox dates correspond to positions in the middle of the curve, not the crossover point. Of course, the curve itself is inverted compared to an analemma traced from the northern hemisphere. And while fall begins today at the Autumnal Equinox for the northern hemisphere, it's the Spring Equinox in the south.","afternoon, analemma, figure-8, curve, mark, position, time, year, make, pinhole, camera, looking, north, southern, zealand, shutter, briefly, opened, clear, local, exposing, photosensitized, glass, plate, spanning, september, winter, summer, solstice, minute, main, exposure, remained, open, sunset, create, trail, bottom, equinox, date, correspond, crossover, point, course, inverted, compared, traced, northern, fall, begin, today, autumnal, spring, south"
A Ring of Fire Sunrise Solar Eclipse,"What's rising above the horizon behind those clouds? It's the Sun.  Most sunrises don't look like this, though, because most sunrises don't include the Moon. In the early morning of 2013 May 10, however, from Western Australia, the Moon was between the Earth and the rising Sun.  At times, it would be hard for the uninformed to understand what was happening.  In an annular eclipse, the Moon is too far from the Earth to block the entire Sun, and at most leaves a ring of fire where sunlight pours out around every edge of the Moon.  The featured time-lapse video also recorded the eclipse through the high refraction of the Earth's atmosphere just above the horizon, making the unusual rising Sun and Moon appear also flattened.  As the video continues, the Sun continues to rise, while the Sun and Moon begin to separate.  The next annular solar eclipse will occur in less than three weeks.  On Saturday, October 14, a ring of fire will be visible through clear skies from a thin swath crossing both North and South America.

Arp 142: The Hummingbird Galaxy,"What's happening to this spiral galaxy? Just a few hundred million years ago, NGC 2936, the upper of the two large galaxies shown at the bottom, was likely a normal spiral galaxy -- spinning, creating stars -- and minding its own business. But then it got too close to the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 2937, just below, and took a turn. Sometimes dubbed the Hummingbird Galaxy for its iconic shape, NGC 2936 is not only being deflected but also being distorted by the close gravitational interaction. Behind filaments of dark interstellar dust, bright blue stars form the nose of the hummingbird, while the center of the spiral appears as an eye.  Alternatively, the galaxy pair, together known as Arp 142, look to some like Porpoise or a penguin protecting an egg. The featured re-processed image showing Arp 142 in great detail was taken recently by the Hubble Space Telescope. Arp 142 lies about 300 million light years away toward the constellation of the Water Snake (Hydra). In a billion years or so the two galaxies will likely merge into one larger galaxy.","hummingbird, galaxy, happening, spiral, year, upper, large, shown, likely, normal, spinning, creating, star, minding, business, massive, elliptical, took, turn, dubbed, iconic, shape, deflected, distorted, close, gravitational, interaction, filament, dark, interstellar, dust, bright, blue, form, nose, center, appears, pair, known, look, porpoise, penguin, protecting, featured, re-processed, image, showing, great, detail, taken, hubble, space, telescope, light, constellation, water, snake, hydra, merge, larger"
IC 4592: The Blue Horsehead Reflection Nebula,"Do you see the horse's head?   What you are seeing is not the famous Horsehead nebula toward Orion, but rather a fainter nebula that only takes on a familiar form with deeper imaging.  The main part of the here-imaged molecular cloud complex is  reflection nebula IC 4592.  Reflection nebulas are made up of very fine dust that normally appears dark but can look quite blue when reflecting the visible light of energetic nearby stars.  In this case, the source of much of the reflected light is a star at the eye of the horse.  That star is part of Nu Scorpii, one of the brighter star systems toward the constellation of the Scorpion (Scorpius).   A second reflection nebula dubbed IC 4601 is visible surrounding two stars above and to the right of the image center.","blue, horsehead, reflection, nebula, horse, head, seeing, famous, orion, fainter, take, familiar, form, deeper, imaging, main, part, here-imaged, molecular, cloud, complex, made, fine, dust, appears, dark, look, reflecting, visible, light, energetic, nearby, star, case, source, reflected, scorpii, brighter, system, constellation, scorpion, scorpius, second, dubbed, surrounding, right, image, center"
STEVE and Milky Way Cross over Rural Road,"Not every road ends in a STEVE. A week ago, a sky enthusiast's journey began with a goal: to photograph an aurora over Lake Huron. Driving through rural Ontario, Canada, the forecasted sky show started unexpectedly early, causing the photographer to stop before arriving at the scenic Great Lake. Aurora images were taken toward the north -- but over land, not sea. While waiting for a second round of auroras, a peculiar band of light was noticed to the west.  Slowly, the photographer and friends realized that this western band was likely an unusual type of aurora: a Strong Thermal Emission Velocity Enhancement (STEVE). Moreover, this STEVE was putting on quite a show: appearing intertwined with the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy while intersecting the horizon just near the end of the country road. After capturing this cosmic X on camera, the photographer paused to appreciate the unexpected awesomeness of finding extraordinary beauty in an ordinary setting.

The Deep Lagoon,"Ridges of glowing interstellar gas and dark dust clouds inhabit the turbulent, cosmic depths of the Lagoon Nebula. Also known as M8, The bright star forming region is about 5,000 light-years distant. It makes for a popular stop on telescopic tours of the constellation Sagittarius toward the center of our Milky Way Galaxy. Dominated by the telltale red emission of ionized hydrogen atoms recombining with stripped electrons, this deep telescopic view of the Lagoon's central reaches is about 40 light-years across. The bright hourglass shape near the center of the frame is gas ionized and sculpted by energetic radiation and extreme stellar winds from a massive young star.","deep, lagoon, ridge, glowing, interstellar, dark, dust, cloud, inhabit, turbulent, cosmic, depth, nebula, known, bright, star, forming, region, light-year, distant, make, popular, stop, telescopic, tour, constellation, sagittarius, center, milky, galaxy, dominated, telltale, emission, ionized, hydrogen, atom, recombining, stripped, view, central, reach, hourglass, shape, frame, sculpted, energetic, radiation, extreme, stellar, wind, massive, young"
Back from Bennu,"Back from asteroid 101955 Bennu, a 110-pound, 31-inch wide sample return capsule rests in a desert on planet Earth in this photo, taken at the Department of Defense Utah Test and Training Range near Salt Lake City last Sunday, September 24. Dropped off by the OSIRIS-Rex spacecraft, the capsule looks charred from the extreme temperatures experienced during its blistering descent through Earth's dense atmosphere. OSIRIS-Rex began its home-ward journey from Bennu in May of 2021. Delivered to NASA’s Johnson Space Center in Houston on September 25, the capsule's canister is expected to contain an uncontaminated sample of about a half pound (250 grams) of Bennu's loosely packed regolith. Working in a new laboratory designed for the OSIRIS-REx mission, scientists and engineers will complete the canister disassembly process, and plan to unveil the sample of the near-Earth asteroid in a broadcast event on October 11.","bennu, asteroid, 110-pound, 31-inch, wide, sample, return, capsule, rest, desert, planet, earth, photo, taken, department, defense, utah, test, training, range, salt, lake, city, last, sunday, september, dropped, osiris-rex, spacecraft, look, charred, extreme, temperature, experienced, blistering, descent, dense, began, home-ward, journey, delivered, johnson, space, center, houston, canister, expected, contain, uncontaminated, half, pound, gram, packed, regolith, working, laboratory, designed, mission, scientist, engineer, complete, process, plan, unveil, near-earth, broadcast, event, october"
A Harvest Moon over Tuscany,"For northern hemisphere dwellers, September's Full Moon was the Harvest Moon. Reflecting warm hues at sunset, it rises behind cypress trees huddled on a hill top in Tuscany, Italy in this telephoto view from September 28.  Famed in festival, story, and song, Harvest Moon is just the traditional name of the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox.  According to lore the name is a fitting one. Despite the diminishing daylight hours as the growing season drew to a close, farmers could harvest crops by the light of a full moon shining on from dusk to dawn. This Harvest Moon was also known to some as a supermoon, a term becoming a traditional name for a full moon near perigee. It was the fourth and final supermoon for 2023.","harvest, moon, tuscany, dweller, september, full, reflecting, warm, sunset, rise, cypress, tree, huddled, hill, italy, telephoto, view, famed, festival, story, song, traditional, name, nearest, autumnal, equinox, according, fitting, diminishing, daylight, hour, growing, season, drew, close, farmer, crop, light, shining, dusk, dawn, known, supermoon, term, becoming, perigee, fourth, final"
A Desert Eclipse,"A good place to see a ring-of-fire eclipse, it seemed, would be from a desert. In a desert, there should be relatively few obscuring clouds and trees.  Therefore late December of 2019, a group of photographers traveled to the United Arab Emirates and Rub al-Khali, the largest continuous sand desert in world, to capture clear images of an unusual eclipse that would be passing over.  A ring-of-fire eclipse is an annular eclipse that occurs when the Moon is far enough away on its elliptical orbit around the Earth so that it appears too small, angularly, to cover the entire Sun. At the maximum of an annular eclipse, the edges of the Sun can be seen all around the edges of the Moon, so that the Moon appears to be a dark spot that covers most -- but not all -- of the Sun. This particular eclipse, they knew, would peak soon after sunrise.  After seeking out such a dry and barren place, it turned out that some of the most interesting eclipse images actually included a tree in the foreground, because, in addition to the sand dunes, the tree gave the surreal background a contrasting sense of normalcy, scale, and texture.  On Saturday, October 14, a new ring of fire will be visible through clear skies from a thin swath crossing both North and South America.","desert, eclipse, good, place, ring-of-fire, seemed, obscuring, cloud, late, december, group, traveled, united, arab, emirate, largest, continuous, sand, world, capture, clear, image, unusual, passing, annular, occurs, elliptical, orbit, earth, appears, small, cover, entire, maximum, edge, seen, moon, dark, spot, particular, knew, peak, sunrise, seeking, barren, turned, interesting, included, tree, foreground, addition, dune, gave, surreal, background, contrasting, sense, scale, texture, saturday, october, ring, fire, visible, thin, swath, crossing, north, south, america"
Sprite Lightning in High Definition,"Sometimes lightning occurs out near space.  One such lightning type is red sprite lightning, which has only been photographed and studied on Earth over the past 25 years.  The origins of all types of lightning remain topics for research, and scientists are still trying to figure out why red sprite lightning occurs at all.  Research has shown that following a powerful positive cloud-to-ground lightning strike, red sprites may start as 100-meter balls of ionized air that shoot down from about 80-km high at 10 percent the speed of light. They are quickly followed by a group of upward streaking ionized balls. Featured here is an extraordinarily high-resolution image of a group of red sprites. This image is a single frame lasting only 1/25th of a second from a video taken above Castelnaud Castle in Dordogne, France, about three weeks ago. The sprites quickly vanished -- no sprites were visible even on the very next video frame.","sprite, lightning, high, definition, space, type, photographed, studied, earth, year, origin, remain, topic, research, scientist, trying, figure, occurs, shown, following, powerful, positive, cloud-to-ground, strike, start, ball, ionized, shoot, 80-km, percent, speed, light, followed, group, streaking, featured, high-resolution, image, single, frame, lasting, second, video, taken, castelnaud, castle, dordogne, france, week, vanished, visible, next"
MyCn 18: The Engraved Hourglass Planetary Nebula,"Do you see the hourglass shape -- or does it see you?  If you can picture it, the rings of MyCn 18 trace the outline of an hourglass -- although one with an unusual eye in its center.  Either way, the sands of time are running out for the central star of this hourglass-shaped planetary nebula. With its nuclear fuel exhausted, this brief, spectacular, closing phase of a Sun-like star's life occurs as its outer layers are ejected - its core becoming a cooling, fading white dwarf. In 1995, astronomers used the Hubble Space Telescope (HST) to make a series of images of planetary nebulae, including the one featured here.  Pictured, delicate rings of colorful glowing gas (nitrogen-red, hydrogen-green, and oxygen-blue) outline the tenuous walls of the hourglass. The unprecedented sharpness of the Hubble images has revealed surprising details of the nebula ejection process that are helping to resolve the outstanding mysteries of the complex shapes and symmetries of planetary nebulas like MyCn 18.","mycn, engraved, hourglass, planetary, nebula, shape, picture, ring, trace, outline, unusual, center, sand, time, running, central, star, hourglass-shaped, nuclear, fuel, exhausted, brief, spectacular, closing, phase, sun-like, life, occurs, outer, layer, ejected, core, becoming, cooling, fading, white, dwarf, astronomer, used, hubble, space, telescope, make, series, image, including, featured, pictured, delicate, colorful, glowing, nitrogen-red, hydrogen-green, oxygen-blue, tenuous, wall, unprecedented, sharpness, revealed, surprising, detail, ejection, process, helping, resolve, outstanding, mystery, complex, symmetry"
IC 2118: The Witch Head Nebula,"Does this nebula look like the head of a witch? The nebula is known popularly as the Witch Head Nebula because, it is said, the nebula's shape resembles a Halloween-style caricature of a witch's head. Exactly how, though, can be a topic of imaginative speculation.  What is clear is that IC 2118 is about 50 light-years across and made of gas and dust that points to -- because it has been partly eroded by -- the nearby star Rigel. One of the brighter stars in the constellation Orion, Rigel lies below the bottom of the featured image. The blue color of the Witch Head Nebula and is caused not only by Rigel's intense blue starlight but because the dust grains scatter blue light more efficiently than red.  The same physical process causes Earth's daytime sky to appear blue, although the scatterers in planet Earth's atmosphere are molecules of nitrogen and oxygen.","witch, head, nebula, look, known, said, shape, resembles, halloween-style, caricature, topic, imaginative, speculation, clear, light-year, made, dust, point, eroded, nearby, star, rigel, brighter, constellation, orion, bottom, featured, image, blue, color, caused, intense, starlight, grain, scatter, light, physical, process, cause, earth, daytime, appear, scatterers, planet, atmosphere, molecule, nitrogen, oxygen"
Ring of Fire over Monument Valley,"Tracking along a narrow path, the shadow of a new moon will race across North, Central, and South America, on October 14. When viewed from the shadow path the apparent size of the lunar disk will not quite completely cover the Sun though. Instead, the moon in silhouette will appear during the minutes of totality surrounded by a fiery ring, an annular solar eclipse more dramatically known as a ring of fire eclipse. This striking time lapse sequence from May of 2012 illustrates the stages of a ring of fire eclipse. From before eclipse start until sunset, they are seen over the iconic buttes of planet Earth's Monument Valley. Remarkably, the October 14 ring of fire eclipse will also be visible over Monument Valley, beginning after sunrise in the eastern sky.","ring, fire, monument, valley, tracking, narrow, path, shadow, moon, race, north, central, south, viewed, apparent, size, lunar, disk, cover, silhouette, appear, minute, totality, surrounded, fiery, annular, solar, eclipse, known, striking, time, lapse, sequence, illustrates, stage, start, sunset, seen, iconic, butte, planet, earth, october, visible, beginning, sunrise, eastern"
Edwin Hubble Discovers the Universe,"How big is our universe? This question, among others, was debated by two leading astronomers in 1920 in what has since become known as astronomy's Great Debate.  Many astronomers then believed that our Milky Way Galaxy was the entire universe.  Many others, though, believed that our galaxy was just one of many.  In the Great Debate, each argument was detailed, but no consensus was reached.  The answer came over three years later with the detected variation of single spot in the Andromeda Nebula, as shown on the original glass discovery plate digitally reproduced here. When Edwin Hubble compared images, he noticed that this spot varied, and on October 6, 1923 wrote ""VAR!"" on the plate.  The best explanation, Hubble knew, was that this spot was the image of a variable star that was very far away. So M31 was really the Andromeda Galaxy -- a galaxy possibly similar to our own.  Annotated 100 years ago, the featured image may not be pretty, but the variable spot on it opened a window through which humanity gazed knowingly, for the first time, into a surprisingly vast cosmos.","edwin, hubble, discovers, universe, question, others, debated, leading, astronomer, become, known, astronomy, great, debate, many, believed, milky, galaxy, entire, argument, detailed, consensus, reached, answer, came, year, detected, variation, single, spot, andromeda, shown, original, glass, discovery, plate, reproduced, compared, image, noticed, varied, wrote, best, explanation, knew, variable, star, similar, annotated, featured, pretty, opened, window, humanity, gazed, first, time, vast, cosmos"
The Once and Future Stars of Andromeda,"This picture of Andromeda shows not only where stars are now, but where stars will be. The big, beautiful Andromeda Galaxy, M31, is a spiral galaxy a mere 2.5 million light-years away.  Image data from space-based and ground-based observatories have been combined here to produce this intriguing composite view of Andromeda at wavelengths both inside and outside normally visible light. The visible light shows where M31's stars are now, highlighted in white and blue hues and imaged by the Hubble, Subaru, and Mayall telescopes.  The infrared light shows where M31's future stars will soon form, highlighted in orange hues and imaged by NASA's Spitzer Space Telescope.  The infrared light tracks enormous lanes of dust, warmed by stars, sweeping along Andromeda's spiral arms.  This dust is a tracer of the galaxy's vast interstellar gas, raw material for future star formation.  Of course, the new stars will likely form over the next hundred million years or so. That's well before Andromeda merges with our Milky Way Galaxy in about 5 billion years.","future, star, andromeda, picture, show, beautiful, galaxy, spiral, light-year, image, data, space-based, ground-based, observatory, combined, produce, intriguing, composite, view, wavelength, outside, visible, light, highlighted, white, blue, imaged, hubble, subaru, mayall, telescope, infrared, orange, nasa, spitzer, space, enormous, lane, dust, warmed, sweeping, tracer, vast, interstellar, material, formation, course, likely, form, next, year, well, merges, milky"
"Plane, Clouds, Moon, Spots, Sun","What's that in front of the Sun?  The closest object is an airplane, visible just below the Sun's center and caught purely by chance.  Next out are numerous clouds in Earth's atmosphere, creating a series of darkened horizontal streaks. Farther out is Earth's Moon, seen as the large dark circular bite on the upper right. Just above the airplane and just below the Sun's surface are sunspots. The main sunspot group captured here, AR 2192, was in 2014 one of the largest ever recorded and had been crackling and bursting with flares since it came around the edge of the Sun a week before. This show of solar silhouettes was unfortunately short-lived.  Within a few seconds the plane flew away. Within a few minutes the clouds drifted off. Within a few hours the partial solar eclipse of the Sun by the Moon was over. Fortunately, when it comes to the Sun, even unexpected  alignments are surprisingly frequent. Perhaps one will be imaged this Saturday when a new partial solar eclipse will be visible from much of North and South America.

A Distorted Sunrise Eclipse,"Yes, but have you ever seen a sunrise like this?  Here, after initial cloudiness, the Sun appeared to rise in two pieces and during a partial eclipse in 2019, causing the photographer to describe it as the most stunning sunrise of his life.  The dark circle near the top of the atmospherically-reddened Sun is the Moon -- but so is the dark peak just below it.  This is because along the way, the Earth's atmosphere had a layer of unusually warm air over the sea which acted like a gigantic lens and created a second image.  For a normal sunrise or sunset, this rare phenomenon of atmospheric optics is known as the Etruscan vase effect. The featured picture was captured in December 2019 from Al Wakrah, Qatar.  Some observers in a narrow band of Earth to the east were able to see a full annular solar eclipse -- where the Moon appears completely surrounded by the background Sun in a ring of fire.  The next solar eclipse, also an annular eclipse for well-placed observers, will occur this coming Saturday.

Hidden Orion from Webb,"The Great Nebula in Orion has hidden stars.   To the unaided eye in visible light, it appears as a small fuzzy patch in the constellation of Orion. But this image was taken by the Webb Space Telescope in a representative-color composite of red and very near infrared light.  It confirms with impressive detail that the  Orion Nebula is a busy neighborhood of young stars, hot gas, and dark dust.  The rollover image shows the same image in representative colors further into the near infrared. The power behind much of the Orion Nebula (M42) is the Trapezium - a cluster of bright stars near the nebula's center.  The diffuse and filamentary glow surrounding the bright stars is mostly heated interstellar dust.  Detailed inspection of these images shows an unexpectedly large number of Jupiter-Mass Binary Objects (JuMBOs), pairs of Jupiter-mass objects which might give a clue to how stars are forming.  The whole Orion Nebula cloud complex, which includes the Horsehead Nebula, will slowly disperse over the next few million years.

NGC 1097: Spiral Galaxy with Supernova,"What's happening in the lower arm of this spiral galaxy? A supernova. Last month, supernova SN 2023rve was discovered with UAE's Al-Khatim Observatory and later found to be consistent with the death explosion of a massive star, possibly leaving behind a black hole. Spiral galaxy NGC 1097 is a relatively close 45 million light years away and visible with a small telescope toward the southern constellation of the Furnace (Fornax).  The galaxy is notable not only for its picturesque spiral arms, but also for faint jets consistent with ancient star streams left over from a galactic collision -- possibly with the small galaxy seen between its arms on the lower left. The featured image highlights the new supernova by blinking between two exposures taken several months apart. Finding supernovas in nearby galaxies can be important in determining the scale and expansion rate of our entire universe -- a topic currently of unexpected tension and much debate.

Mu Cephei,"Mu Cephei is a very large star. An M-class supergiant some 1500 times the size of the Sun, it is one of the largest stars visible to the unaided eye, and even one of the largest in the entire Galaxy. If it replaced the Sun in our fair Solar System, Mu Cephei would easily engulf Mars and Jupiter. Historically known as Herschel's Garnet Star, Mu Cephei is extremely red. Approximately 2800 light-years distant, the supergiant is seen near the edge of reddish emission nebula IC 1396 toward the royal northern constellation Cepheus in this telescopic view. Much cooler and hence redder than the Sun, this supergiant's light is further reddened by absorption and scattering due to intervening dust within the Milky Way. A well-studied variable star understood to be in a late phase of stellar evolution, Mu Cephei is a massive star too, destined to ultimately explode as a core-collapse supernova.","cephei, large, star, m-class, supergiant, time, size, largest, visible, unaided, entire, galaxy, replaced, fair, solar, system, engulf, jupiter, known, herschel, garnet, light-year, distant, seen, edge, reddish, emission, nebula, royal, northern, constellation, cepheus, telescopic, view, much, cooler, hence, redder, light, reddened, absorption, scattering, intervening, dust, milky, well-studied, variable, understood, late, phase, stellar, evolution, massive, destined, explode, core-collapse, supernova"
Hydrogen Clouds of M33,"Gorgeous spiral galaxy Messier 33 seems to have more than its fair share of glowing hydrogen gas. A prominent member of the local group of galaxies, M33 is also known as the Triangulum Galaxy and lies a mere 3 million light-years away.  The galaxy's central 30,000 light-years or so are shown in this sharp galaxy portrait. The portrait features M33's reddish ionized hydrogen clouds or HII regions. Sprawling along loose spiral arms that wind toward the core, M33's giant HII regions are some of the largest known stellar nurseries, sites of the formation of short-lived but very massive stars.

Circular Sun Halo,"Want to see a ring around the Sun? It's easy to do in daytime skies around the world. Created by randomly oriented ice crystals in thin high cirrus clouds, circular 22 degree halos are visible much more often than rainbows. This one was captured by smart phone photography on May 29, 2021 near Rome, Italy. Carefully blocking the Sun, for example with a finger tip, is usually all that it takes to reveal the common bright halo ring. The halo's characteristic angular radius is about equal to the span of your hand, thumb to little finger, at the end of your outstretched arm.  Want to see a ring of fire eclipse? That's harder. The spectacular annular phase of today's (October 14) solar eclipse, known as a ring of fire, is briefly visible only when standing along the Moon's narrow shadow track that passes over limited parts of North, Central, and South America. The solar eclipse is partial though, when seen from broader regions throughout the Americas.

An Eclipse Tree,"Yes, but can your tree do this?  If you look closely at the ground in the featured image, you will see many images of yesterday's solar eclipse -- created by a tree. Gaps between tree leaves act like pinhole lenses and each create a small image of the partially eclipsed Sun visible in the other direction.  The image was taken in Burleson, Texas, USA. Yesterday, people across the Americas were treated to a partial eclipse of the Sun, when the Moon moves in front of part of the Sun. People in a narrow band of Earth were treated to an annular eclipse, also called a ring-of-fire eclipse, when the Moon becomes completely engulfed by the Sun and sunlight streams around all of the Moon's edges. In answer to the lede question, your tree not only can do this, but will do it every time that a visible solar eclipse passes overhead.  Next April 8, a deeper, total solar eclipse will move across North America.

Eclipse Rings,"She knew everything but the question. She was well aware that there would be a complete annular eclipse of the Sun visible from their driving destination: Lake Abert in Oregon.  She knew that the next ring-of-fire eclipse would occur in the USA only in 16 more years, making this a rare photographic opportunity.  She was comfortable with the plan: that she and her boyfriend would appear in front of the eclipse in silhouette, sometimes alone, and sometimes together.  She knew that the annular phase of this eclipse would last only a few minutes and she helped in the many hours of planning.  She could see their friend who set up the camera about 400 meters away at the bottom of a ridge.  What she didn't know was the question she would be asked. But she did know the answer: ""yes"".

"PDS 70: Disk, Planets, and Moons","It's not the big ring that's attracting the most attention. Although the big planet-forming ring around the star PDS 70 is clearly imaged and itself quite interesting. It's also not the planet on the right, just inside the big disk, that’s being talked about the most.  Although the planet PDS 70c is a newly formed and, interestingly, similar in size and mass to Jupiter. It's the fuzzy patch around the planet PDS 70c that's causing the commotion. That fuzzy patch is thought to be a dusty disk that is now forming into moons -- and that had never been seen before. The featured image was taken in 2021 by the Atacama Large Millimeter Array (ALMA) of 66 radio telescopes in the high Atacama Desert of northern Chile.  Based on ALMA data, astronomers infer that the moon-forming exoplanetary disk has a radius similar to our Earth's orbit, and may one day form three or so Luna-sized moons -- not very different from our Jupiter's four.","disk, planet, moon, ring, attracting, attention, planet-forming, star, imaged, interesting, talked, formed, similar, size, mass, jupiter, fuzzy, patch, causing, commotion, thought, dusty, forming, seen, featured, image, taken, atacama, large, millimeter, array, alma, radio, telescope, high, desert, northern, chile, based, data, astronomer, infer, moon-forming, exoplanetary, radius, earth, orbit, form, luna-sized, different"
Dust and the Western Veil Nebula,"It's so big it is easy to miss. The entire Veil Nebula spans six times the diameter of the full moon, but is so dim you need binoculars to see it. The nebula was created about 15,000 years ago when a star in the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus) exploded. The spectacular explosion would have appeared brighter than even Venus for a week - but there is no known record of it.  Pictured is the western edge of the still-expanding gas cloud. Notable gas filaments include the Witch's Broom Nebula on the upper left near the bright foreground star 52 Cygni, and Fleming's Triangular Wisp (formerly known as Pickering's Triangle) running diagonally up the image middle.  What is rarely imaged -- but seen in the featured long exposure across many color bands -- is the reflecting brown dust that runs vertically up the image left, dust likely created in the cool atmospheres of massive stars.","dust, western, veil, nebula, easy, miss, entire, span, time, full, moon, need, binoculars, created, year, star, constellation, swan, cygnus, exploded, spectacular, explosion, appeared, venus, week, known, record, pictured, edge, still-expanding, cloud, notable, filament, include, witch, broom, upper, left, near, bright, foreground, cygni, fleming, triangular, wisp, pickering, triangle, running, image, middle, imaged, seen, featured, long, exposure, many, color, band, reflecting, brown, cool, massive"
A Sunrise at Sunset Point,"This timelapse series captured on October 14 is set against the sunrise view from Sunset Point, Bryce Canyon, planet Earth. Of course on that date the New Moon caught up with the Sun in the canyon's morning skies. Local temperatures fell as the Moon's shadow swept across the high altitude scene and the brilliant morning sunlight became a more subdued yellow hue cast over the reddish rocky landscape. In the timelapse series, images were taken at 2 minute intervals. The camera and solar filter were fixed to a tripod to follow the phases of the annular solar eclipse.

Galaxies and a Comet,"Galaxies abound in this sharp telescopic image recorded on October 12 in dark skies over June Lake, California. The celestial scene spans nearly 2 degrees within the boundaries of the well-trained northern constellation Canes Venatici. Prominent at the upper left 23.5 million light-years distant is big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 4258, known to some as Messier 106. Eye-catching edge-on spiral NGC 4217 is above and right of center about 60 million light-years away. Just passing through the pretty field of view is comet C/2023 H2 Lemmon, discovered last April in image data from the Mount Lemmon Survey. Here the comet sports more of a lime green coma though, along with a faint, narrow ion tail stretching toward the top of the frame. This visitor to the inner Solar System is presently less than 7 light-minutes away and still difficult to spot with binoculars, but it's growing brighter. Comet C/2023 H2 Lemmon will reach perihelion, its closest point to the Sun, on October 29 and perigee, its closest to our fair planet, on November 10 as it transitions from morning to evening northern skies.","galaxy, comet, sharp, telescopic, image, recorded, dark, june, lake, california, celestial, scene, span, degree, boundary, well-trained, northern, constellation, cane, prominent, upper, left, light-year, distant, beautiful, spiral, known, messier, eye-catching, edge-on, right, center, passing, pretty, field, view, c/2023, lemmon, discovered, last, april, data, mount, survey, sport, lime, green, coma, along, faint, narrow, tail, stretching, frame, visitor, inner, solar, system, light-minutes, difficult, spot, binoculars, growing, brighter, reach, perihelion, closest, point, october, perigee, fair, planet, transition, morning, evening"
Quarter Moons,"Half way between New Moon and Full Moon is the Moon's first quarter phase. That's a quarter of the way around its moonthly orbit. At the first quarter phase, half the Moon's visible side is illuminated by sunlight. For the Moon's third quarter phase, half way between Full Moon and New Moon, sunlight illuminates the other half of the visible lunar disk. At both first and third quarter phases, the terminator, or shadow line separating the lunar night and day, runs down the middle. Near the terminator, long shadows bring lunar craters and mountains in to sharp relief, making the quarter phases a good time to observe the Moon. But in case you missed some, all the quarter phases of the Moon and their calendar dates during 2022 can be found in this well-planned array of telephoto images. Of course, you can observe a first quarter Moon tonight.

Ghost Aurora over Canada,"What does this aurora look like to you? While braving the cold to watch the skies above northern Canada early one morning in 2013, a most unusual aurora appeared.  The aurora definitely appeared to be shaped like something, but what? Two ghostly possibilities recorded by the astrophotographer were ""witch"" and ""goddess of dawn"", but please feel free to suggest your own Halloween-enhanced impressions. Regardless of fantastical pareidolic interpretations, the pictured aurora had a typical green color and was surely caused by the scientifically commonplace action of high-energy particles from space interacting with oxygen in Earth's upper atmosphere.

Moon Io from Spacecraft Juno,"There goes another one!  Volcanoes on Jupiter's moon Io keep erupting. To investigate, NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft has begun a series of visits to this very strange moon. Io is about the size of Earth's moon, but because of gravitational flexing by Jupiter and other moons, Io's interior gets heated and its surface has become covered with volcanoes.  The featured image is from last week's flyby, passing within 12,000 kilometers above the dangerously active world. The surface of Io is covered with sulfur and frozen sulfur dioxide, making it appear yellow, orange and brown. As hoped, Juno flew by just as a volcano was erupting -- with its faint plume visible near the top of the featured image.  Studying Io's volcanoes and plumes helps humanity better understand how Jupiter's complex system of moons, rings, and auroras interact. Juno is scheduled to make two flybys of Io during the coming months that are almost 10 times closer: one in December and another in February 2024.

Arp 87: Merging Galaxies from Hubble,"This dance is to the death.  As these two large galaxies duel, a cosmic bridge of stars, gas, and dust currently stretches over 75,000 light-years and joins them.  The bridge itself is strong evidence that these two immense star systems have passed close to each other and experienced violent tides induced by mutual gravity. As further evidence, the face-on spiral galaxy on the right, also known as NGC 3808A, exhibits many young blue star clusters produced in a burst of star formation. The twisted edge-on spiral on the left (NGC 3808B) seems to be wrapped in the material bridging the galaxies and surrounded by a curious polar ring. Together, the system is known as Arp 87. While such interactions are drawn out over billions of years, repeated close passages will ultimately create one merged galaxy. Although this scenario does look unusual, galactic mergers are thought to be common, with Arp 87 representing a stage in this inevitable process. The Arp 87 dancing pair are about 300 million light-years distant toward the constellation of the Lion (Leo). The prominent edge-on spiral galaxy at the far left appears to be a more distant background galaxy and not involved in the on-going merger.","merging, galaxy, hubble, dance, death, large, duel, cosmic, bridge, star, dust, stretch, light-year, join, strong, evidence, immense, system, passed, experienced, violent, tide, induced, mutual, gravity, face-on, spiral, right, known, exhibit, many, young, blue, cluster, produced, burst, formation, twisted, edge-on, left, seems, wrapped, material, bridging, surrounded, curious, polar, ring, interaction, drawn, year, repeated, close, passage, create, merged, scenario, look, unusual, galactic, merger, thought, common, representing, stage, inevitable, process, dancing, pair, distant, constellation, lion, prominent, appears, background, involved, on-going"
Gone in 60 Seconds: A Green Flash Sunset,"In 60 seconds, this setting Sun will turn green. Actually, the top of the Sun already appears not only green, but wavey -- along with all of its edges. The Sun itself is unchanged -- both effects are caused by looking along hot and cold layers in Earth's atmosphere.  The unusual color is known as a green flash and occurs because these atmospheric layers not only shift background images but disperse colors into slightly different directions, like a prism.  The featured video was captured earlier this month off the coast of Hawaii, USA. After waiting those 60 seconds, at the video's end, the upper part of the Sun seems to hover alone in space, while turning not only green, but blue.  Then suddenly, the Sun appears to shrink to nothing -- only to return tomorrow.","gone, second, green, flash, sunset, setting, turn, appears, wavey, edge, unchanged, effect, caused, looking, cold, layer, earth, atmosphere, unusual, color, known, occurs, atmospheric, shift, background, image, disperse, different, direction, prism, featured, video, captured, month, coast, hawaii, waiting, upper, part, seems, space, turning, blue, shrink, nothing, return, tomorrow"
Orionids in Taurus,"History's first known periodic comet, Comet Halley (1P/Halley), returns to the inner Solar System every 76 years or so. The famous comet made its last appearance to the naked-eye in 1986. But dusty debris from Comet Halley can be seen raining through planet Earth's skies twice a year during two annual meteor showers, the Eta Aquarids in May and the Orionids in October. In fact, an unhurried series of exposures captured these two bright meteors, vaporizing bits of Halley dust, during the early morning hours of October 23 against a starry background along the Taurus molecular cloud. Impacting the atmosphere at about 66 kilometers per second their greenish streaks point back to the shower's radiant just north of Orion's bright star Betelgeuse off the lower left side of the frame. The familiar Pleiades star cluster anchors the dusty celestial scene at the right.","orionids, taurus, history, first, known, periodic, comet, halley, return, inner, solar, system, year, famous, made, last, appearance, naked-eye, dusty, debris, seen, raining, planet, earth, annual, meteor, shower, aquarids, october, fact, unhurried, series, exposure, captured, bright, vaporizing, early, morning, hour, starry, background, molecular, cloud, impacting, kilometer, second, greenish, streak, point, radiant, north, orion, star, betelgeuse, left, side, frame, familiar, pleiades, cluster, anchor, celestial, scene, right"
Encke and the Tadpoles,"History's second known periodic comet is Comet Encke (2P/Encke). As it swings through the inner Solar System, Encke's orbit takes it from an aphelion, its greatest distance from the Sun, inside the orbit of Jupiter to a perihelion just inside the orbit of Mercury. Returning to its perihelion every 3.3 years, Encke has the shortest period of the Solar System's major comets. Comet Encke is also associated with (at least) two annual meteor showers on planet Earth, the North and South Taurids. Both showers are active in late October and early November. Their two separate radiants lie near bright star Aldebaran in the head-strong constellation Taurus. A faint comet, Encke was captured in this telescopic field of view imaged on the morning of August 24. Then, Encke's pretty greenish coma was close on the sky to the young, embedded star cluster and light-years long, tadpole-shaped star-forming clouds in emission nebula IC 410. Now near bright star Spica in Virgo Comet Encke passed its 2023 perihelion only five days ago, on October 22.","encke, tadpole, history, second, known, periodic, comet, swing, inner, solar, system, orbit, take, aphelion, greatest, distance, jupiter, perihelion, mercury, returning, year, shortest, period, major, associated, least, annual, meteor, shower, planet, earth, north, south, taurids, active, late, october, early, separate, radiants, bright, star, aldebaran, head-strong, constellation, taurus, faint, captured, telescopic, field, view, imaged, morning, august, pretty, greenish, coma, young, embedded, light-year, long, tadpole-shaped, star-forming, cloud, emission, spica, virgo, passed"
The Ghosts of Gamma Cas,"Gamma Cassiopeiae shines high in northern autumn evening skies. It's the brightest spiky star in this telescopic field of view toward the constellation Cassiopeia. Gamma Cas shares the ethereal-looking scene with ghostly interstellar clouds of gas and dust, IC 59 (top left) and IC 63.  About 600 light-years distant, the clouds aren't actually ghosts. They are slowly disappearing though, eroding under the influence of energetic radiation from hot and luminous gamma Cas. Gamma Cas is physically located only 3 to 4 light-years from the nebulae. Slightly closer to gamma Cas, IC 63 is dominated by red H-alpha light emitted as hydrogen atoms ionized by the star's ultraviolet radiation recombine with electrons. Farther from the star, IC 59 shows proportionally less H-alpha emission but more of the characteristic blue tint of dust reflected star light. The cosmic stage spans over 1 degree or 10 light-years at the estimated distance of gamma Cas and friends.","ghost, gamma, cassiopeiae, shine, high, northern, autumn, evening, brightest, spiky, star, telescopic, field, view, constellation, cassiopeia, share, ethereal-looking, scene, interstellar, cloud, dust, left, light-year, distant, disappearing, eroding, influence, energetic, radiation, luminous, located, nebula, dominated, h-alpha, light, emitted, hydrogen, atom, ionized, ultraviolet, recombine, electron, show, emission, characteristic, blue, tint, reflected, cosmic, stage, span, degree, estimated, distance, friend"
A Partial Lunar Eclipse,"What's happened to the Moon?  Within the last day, part of the Moon moved through the Earth's shadow.  This happens about once or twice a year, but not every month since the Moon's orbit around the Earth is slightly tilted.  Pictured here, the face of a full Hunter's Moon is shown twice from Italy during this partial lunar eclipse.  On the left, most of the Moon appears overexposed except for the eclipsed bottom right, which shows some familiar lunar surface details. In contrast, on the right, most of the (same) Moon appears normally exposed, with the exception of the bottom right, which now appears dark. All lunar eclipses are visible from the half of the Earth facing the Moon at the time of the eclipse, but this eclipse was visible specifically from Europe, Africa, Asia, and Australia, clouds permitting.

Halloween and the Wizard Nebula,"Halloween's origin is ancient and astronomical.  Since the fifth century BC, Halloween has been celebrated as a cross-quarter day, a day halfway between an equinox (equal day / equal night) and a solstice (minimum day / maximum night in the northern hemisphere).  With a modern calendar however, even though Halloween occurs today, the real cross-quarter day will occur next week.  Another cross-quarter day is Groundhog Day. Halloween's modern celebration retains historic roots in dressing to scare away the spirits of the dead.  Perhaps a fitting tribute to this ancient holiday is this closeup view of the Wizard Nebula (NGC 7380).  Visually, the interplay of stars, gas, and dust has created a shape that appears to some like a fictional ancient sorcerer. Although the nebula may last only a few million years, some of the stars being conjured from the gas by the great gravitational powers may outlive our Sun.","halloween, wizard, nebula, origin, ancient, astronomical, fifth, century, celebrated, cross-quarter, halfway, equinox, equal, night, solstice, minimum, maximum, modern, calendar, occurs, today, real, next, week, groundhog, celebration, retains, historic, root, dressing, scare, spirit, dead, fitting, tribute, holiday, closeup, view, interplay, star, dust, created, shape, appears, fictional, sorcerer, last, year, conjured, great, gravitational, power, outlive"
Annular Solar Eclipse over Utah,"Part of the Sun disappeared earlier this month, but few people were worried. The missing part, which included the center from some locations, just went behind the Moon in what is known as an annular solar eclipse.  Featured here is an eclipse sequence taken as the Moon was overtaking the rising Sun in the sky. The foreground hill is Factory Butte in Utah, USA. The rays flaring out from the Sun are not real -- they result from camera aperture diffraction and are known as sunstar. The Moon is real, but appears only in silhouette in this ring-of-fire eclipse. As stunning as this eclipse sequence is, it was considered just practice by the astrophotographer.  The reason?

The Fornax Cluster of Galaxies,"Named for the southern constellation toward which most of its galaxies can be found, the Fornax Cluster is one of the closest clusters of galaxies. About 62 million light-years away, it's over 20 times more distant than our neighboring Andromeda Galaxy, but only about 10 percent farther along than the better known and more populated Virgo Galaxy Cluster. Seen across this three degree wide field-of-view, almost every yellowish splotch on the image is an elliptical galaxy in the Fornax cluster.

Jupiter by Moonlight,"That bright beacon you've seen rising in the east just after sunset is Jupiter. Climbing high in midnight skies, our Solar System's ruling gas giant was at its 2023 opposition, opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky, on November 2. But only a few days earlier, on October 28, the Moon was at its own opposition. Then both Full Moon and Jupiter could share this telephoto field of view. The celestial scene is composed from two exposures, one long and one short, blended to record bright planet and even brighter Moon during that evening's partial lunar eclipse.

Creature Aurora Over Norway,"It was Halloween and the sky looked like a creature. Exactly which creature, the astrophotographer was unsure (but possibly you can suggest one). Exactly what caused this  eerie apparition in 2013 was sure: one of the best auroral displays that year. This spectacular aurora had an unusually high degree of detail. Pictured here, the vivid green and purple  auroral colors are caused by high atmospheric oxygen and nitrogen reacting to a burst of incoming electrons.  Birch trees in Tromsø, Norway formed an also eerie foreground. Frequently, new photogenic auroras accompany new geomagnetic storms.

Red Aurora over Italy,"What was that red glow on the horizon last night? Aurora. Our unusually active Sun produced a surface explosion a few days ago that sent out a burst of electrons, protons, and more massive charged nuclei. This coronal mass ejection (CME) triggered auroras here on Earth that are being reported unusually far south in Earth's northern hemisphere.  For example, this was the first time that the astrophotographer captured aurora from her home country of Italy. Additionally, many images from these auroras appear quite red in color.  In the featured image, the town of Comelico Superiore in the Italian Alps is visible in the foreground, with the central band of our Milky Way galaxy seen rising from the lower left.

A Martian Dust Devil Spins By,"It moved across the surface of Mars -- what was it? A dust devil. Such spinning columns of rising air are heated by the warm surface and are also common in warm and dry areas on planet Earth.  Typically lasting only a few minutes, dust devils become visible as they pick up loose red-colored dust, leaving the darker and heavier sand beneath intact.  Dust devils not only look cool -- they can leave visible trails, and have been credited with unexpected cleanings of the surfaces of solar panels. The images in the featured AI-interpolated video were captured in early August by the Perseverance rover currently searching for signs of ancient life in Jezero Crater. The six-second time-lapse video encapsulates a real duration of just over one minute.  Visible in the distance, the spinning dust devil was estimated to be passing by at about 20 kilometers per hour and extend up about 2 kilometers high.

Perseus Galaxy Cluster from Euclid,"There's a new space telescope in the sky: Euclid. Equipped with two large panoramic cameras, Euclid captures light from the visible to the near-infrared.  It took five hours of observing for Euclid's 1.2-meter diameter primary mirror  to capture, through its sharp optics, the 1000+ galaxies in the Perseus cluster, which lies 250 million light years away.  More than 100,000 galaxies are visible in the background, some as far away as 10 billion light years. The revolutionary nature of Euclid lies in the combination of its wide field of view (twice the area of the full moon), its high angular resolution (thanks to its 620 Megapixel camera), and its infrared vision, which captures both images and spectra.  Euclid's initial surveys, covering a third of the sky and recording over 2 billion galaxies, will enable a study of how dark matter and dark energy have shaped our universe.","perseus, galaxy, cluster, euclid, space, telescope, equipped, large, panoramic, camera, capture, light, visible, near-infrared, took, hour, observing, 1.2-meter, diameter, primary, mirror, sharp, optic, year, background, revolutionary, nature, combination, wide, field, view, area, full, moon, high, angular, resolution, thanks, megapixel, infrared, vision, image, spectrum, initial, survey, covering, third, recording, enable, study, dark, matter, energy, shaped, universe"
M1: The Crab Nebula,"The Crab Nebula is cataloged as M1, the first object on Charles Messier's famous 18th century list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab is now known to be a supernova remnant, debris from the death explosion of a massive star witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. This sharp image from the James Webb Space Telescope’s NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) and MIRI (Mid-Infrared Instrument) explores the eerie glow and fragmented strands of the still expanding cloud of interstellar debris in infrared light. One of the most exotic objects known to modern astronomers, the Crab Pulsar, a neutron star spinning 30 times a second, is visible as a bright spot near the nebula's center. Like a cosmic dynamo, this collapsed remnant of the stellar core powers the Crab's emission across the electromagnetic spectrum. Spanning about 12 light-years, the Crab Nebula is a mere 6,500 light-years away in the head-strong constellation Taurus.

UHZ1: Distant Galaxy and Black Hole,"Dominated by dark matter, massive cluster of galaxies Abell 2744 is known to some as Pandora's Cluster. It lies 3.5 billion light-years away toward the constellation Sculptor. Using the galaxy cluster's enormous mass as a gravitational lens to warp spacetime and magnify even more distant objects directly behind it, astronomers have found a background galaxy, UHZ1, at a remarkable redshift of Z=10.1. That puts UHZ1 far beyond Abell 2744, at a distance of 13.2 billion light-years, seen when our universe was about 3 percent of its current age. UHZ1 is identified in the insets of this composited image combining X-rays (purple hues) from the spacebased Chandra X-ray Observatory and infrared light from the James Webb Space Telescope. The X-ray emission from UHZ1 detected in the Chandra data is the telltale signature of a growing supermassive black hole at the center of the ultra high redshift galaxy.  That makes UHZ1's growing black hole the most distant black hole ever detected in X-rays, a result that now hints at how and when the first supermassive black holes in the universe formed.","uhz1, distant, galaxy, black, hole, dominated, dark, matter, massive, cluster, abell, known, pandora, light-year, constellation, sculptor, using, enormous, mass, gravitational, lens, warp, spacetime, magnify, object, astronomer, found, remarkable, redshift, z=10.1, distance, seen, universe, percent, current, identified, inset, composited, image, combining, x-ray, purple, spacebased, chandra, observatory, infrared, light, james, webb, space, telescope, emission, detected, data, telltale, signature, growing, supermassive, center, ultra, high, make, result, hint, formed"
The SAR Arc and the Milky Way,"This broad, luminous red arc was a surprising visitor to partly cloudy evening skies over northern France. Captured extending toward the zenith in a west-to-east mosaic of images from November 5, the faint atmospheric ribbon of light is an example of a Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arc. The rare night sky phenomenon was also spotted at unusually low latitudes around world, along with more dynamic auroral displays during an intense geomagnetic storm. SAR arcs and their relation to auroral emission have been explored by citizen science and satellite investigations. From altitudes substantially above the normal auroral glow, the deep red SAR emission is thought to be caused by strong heating due to currents flowing in planet Earth's inner magnetosphere. Beyond this SAR, the Milky Way arcs above the cloud banks along the horizon, a regular visitor to night skies over northern France.","milky, broad, luminous, surprising, visitor, cloudy, evening, northern, france, captured, extending, zenith, west-to-east, mosaic, image, november, faint, atmospheric, ribbon, light, example, stable, auroral, rare, night, phenomenon, spotted, latitude, world, dynamic, display, intense, geomagnetic, storm, relation, emission, explored, citizen, science, satellite, investigation, altitude, normal, glow, thought, caused, strong, heating, current, flowing, planet, earth, inner, cloud, bank, horizon, regular"
Gibbous Moon beyond Swedish Mountain,"This is a gibbous Moon. More Earthlings are familiar with a full moon, when the entire face of Luna is lit by the Sun, and a crescent moon, when only a sliver of the Moon's face is lit.  When more than half of the Moon is illuminated, though, but still short of full illumination, the phase is called gibbous.  Rarely seen in television and movies, gibbous moons are quite common in the actual night sky. The featured image was taken in Jämtland, Sweden near the end of 2018 October. That gibbous moon turned, in a few days, into a crescent moon, and then a new moon, then back to a crescent, and a few days past that, back to gibbous.  Setting up to capture a picturesque gibbous moonscape, the photographer was quite surprised to find an airplane, surely well in the foreground, appearing to fly past it.

Three Planets Rock,"In the fading darkness before dawn, a tilted triangle appeared to balance atop a rock formation off the southern tip of Sicily.  Making up the points of the triangle are three of the four brightest objects visible in Earth’s sky: Jupiter, Venus and the Moon.  Though a thin waning crescent, most of the moon’s disk is visible due to earthshine.  Captured in this image on 2022 April 27, Venus (center) and Jupiter (left) are roughly three degrees apart --  and were headed toward a close conjunction.

M1: The Incredible Expanding Crab,"Cataloged as M1, the Crab Nebula is the first on Charles Messier's famous list of things which are not comets. In fact, the Crab Nebula is now known to be a supernova remnant, an expanding cloud of debris from the death explosion of a massive star. The violent birth of the Crab was witnessed by astronomers in the year 1054. Roughly 10 light-years across, the nebula is still expanding at a rate of about 1,500 kilometers per second. You can see the expansion by comparing these sharp images from the Hubble Space Telescope and James Webb Space Telescope. The Crab's dynamic, fragmented filaments were captured in visible light by Hubble in 2005 and Webb in infrared light in 2023.

In the foreground are Orion's Orbital Maneuvering System engine and auxillary engines, at the bottom of the European Service Module. Beyond one of the module's 7-meter long extended solar array wings lies the spacecraft's beautiful home world. Making close flybys of the lunar surface and reaching a retrograde orbit 70,000 kilometers beyond the Moon, the uncrewed Artemis I mission lasted over 25 days, testing capabilities to enable human exploration of the Moon and Mars.

"Space Station, Solar Prominences, Sun","That's no sunspot. It's the International Space Station (ISS) caught passing in front of the Sun. Sunspots, individually, have a dark central umbra, a lighter surrounding penumbra, and no Dragon capsules attached.  By contrast, the ISS is a complex and multi-spired mechanism, one of the largest and most complicated spacecraft ever created by humanity.  Also, sunspots circle the Sun, whereas the ISS orbits the Earth.  Transiting the Sun is not very unusual for the ISS, which orbits the Earth about every 90 minutes, but getting one's location, timing and equipment just right for a great image is rare.  The featured picture combined three images all taken in 2021 from the same location and at nearly the same time. One image -- overexposed -- captured the faint prominences seen across the top of the Sun, a second image -- underexposed -- captured the complex texture of the Sun's chromosphere, while the third image -- the hardest to get -- captured the space station as it shot across the Sun in a fraction of a second.

Fleming's Triangular Wisp,"These chaotic and tangled filaments of shocked, glowing gas are spread across planet Earth's sky toward the constellation of Cygnus as part of the Veil Nebula. The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant, an expanding cloud born of the death explosion of a massive star. Light from the original supernova explosion likely reached Earth over 5,000 years ago. The glowing filaments are really more like long ripples in a sheet seen almost edge on, remarkably well separated into the glow of ionized hydrogen atoms shown in red and oxygen in blue hues. Also known as the Cygnus Loop and cataloged as NGC 6979, the Veil Nebula now spans about 6 times the diameter of the full Moon. The length of the wisp corresponds to about 30 light years, given its estimated distance of 2,400 light years.

On the night of November 9 the nadir-centered 360 degree mosaic was captured by digital camera from the Kirkjufell mountain area of western Iceland. Curtains of shimmering Aurora Borealis or Northern Lights provide the pale greenish illumination. The intense auroral display was caused by solar activity that rocked Earth's magnetosphere in early November and produced strong geomagnetic storms. Kirkjufell mountain itself stands at the top of the stereographic projection's circular horizon.

LBN 86: The Eagle Ray Nebula,"This eagle ray glides across a cosmic sea.  Officially cataloged as SH2-63 and LBN 86, the dark nebula is composed of gas and dust that just happens to appear shaped like a common ocean fish.  The interstellar dust nebula appears light brown as it blocks and reddens visible light emitted behind it. Dark nebulas glow primarily in infrared light, but also reflect visible light from surrounding stars. The dust in dark nebulas is usually sub-millimeter chunks of carbon, silicon, and oxygen, frequently coated with frozen carbon monoxide and nitrogen.  Dark nebulas are also known as molecular clouds because they also contain relatively high amounts of molecular hydrogen and larger molecules. Previously unnamed, the here dubbed Eagle Ray Nebula is normally quite dim but has been imaged clearly over 20-hours through dark skies in Chile.

Ganymede from Juno,"What does the largest moon in the Solar System look like?  Jupiter's moon Ganymede, larger than even Mercury and Pluto, has an icy surface speckled with bright young craters overlying a mixture of older, darker, more cratered terrain laced with grooves and ridges.  The cause of the grooved terrain remains a topic of research, with a leading hypothesis relating it to shifting ice plates.  Ganymede is thought to have an ocean layer that contains more water than Earth -- and might contain life.  Like Earth's Moon, Ganymede keeps the same face towards its central planet, in this case Jupiter.  The featured image was captured in 2021 by NASA's robotic Juno spacecraft when it passed by the immense moon.  The close pass reduced Juno's orbital period around Jupiter from 53 days to 43 days.

A Landspout Tornado over Kansas,"Could there be a tornado inside another tornado? In general, no.  OK, but could there be a tornado inside a wider dust devil? No again, for one reason because tornados comes down from the sky, but dust devils rise up from the ground. What is pictured is a landspout, an unusual type of tornado known to occur on the edge of a violent thunderstorm. The featured landspout was imaged and identified in Kansas, USA, in June 2019 by an experienced storm chaser.  The real tornado is in the center, and the outer sheath was possibly created by large dust particles thrown out from the central tornado.

Over 430,000 kilometers from Earth in a distant retrograde orbit, Orion surpassed the record for most distant spacecraft designed to carry humans. That record was previously set in 1970 during the Apollo 13 mission to the Moon. Both Earth and Moon are in the same field of view in this video frame from Orion on Artemis I mission flight day 13. The planet and its large natural satellite even appear about the same apparent size from the uncrewed spacecraft's perspective.","flight, artemis, mission, orion, spacecraft, reached, maximum, distance, home, world, kilometer, earth, distant, retrograde, orbit, surpassed, record, designed, carry, human, apollo, moon, field, view, video, frame, planet, large, natural, satellite, appear, apparent, size, uncrewed, perspective"
Milky Way Rising,"The core of the Milky Way is rising beyond the Chilean mountain-top La Silla Observatory in this deep night skyscape. Seen toward the constellation Sagittarius, our home galaxy's center is flanked on the left, by the European Southern Observatory's New Technology Telescope which pioneered the use of active optics to accurately control the shape of large telescope mirrors. To the right stands the ESO 3.6-meter Telescope, home of the exoplanet hunting HARPS and NIRPS spectrographs. Between them, the galaxy's central bulge is filled with obscuring clouds of interstellar dust, bright stars, clusters, and nebulae. Prominent reddish hydrogen emission from the star-forming Lagoon Nebula, M8, is near center. The Trifid Nebula, M20, combines blue light of a dusty reflection nebula with reddish emission just left of the cosmic Lagoon. Both are popular stops on telescopic tours of the galactic center. The composited image is a stack of separate exposures for ground and sky made in April 2023, all captured consecutively with the same framing and camera equipment.","milky, rising, core, chilean, mountain-top, silla, observatory, deep, night, skyscape, seen, constellation, sagittarius, home, galaxy, center, flanked, left, european, southern, technology, telescope, pioneered, active, optic, control, shape, large, mirror, right, stand, 3.6-meter, exoplanet, hunting, harp, nirps, spectrograph, central, bulge, filled, obscuring, cloud, interstellar, dust, bright, star, cluster, nebula, prominent, reddish, hydrogen, emission, star-forming, lagoon, trifid, combine, blue, light, dusty, reflection, cosmic, popular, stop, telescopic, tour, galactic, composited, image, stack, separate, exposure, ground, made, april, captured, framing, camera, equipment"
Startrails over Beijing Ancient Observatory,"You can take a subway ride to visit this observatory in Beijing, China but you won't find any telescopes there. Starting in the 1400s astronomers erected devices at the Beijing Ancient Observatory site to enable them to accurately measure and track the positions of naked-eye stars and planets. Some of the large, ornate astronomical instruments are still standing. You can even see stars from the star observation platform today, but now only the very brightest celestial beacons are visible against the city lights. In this time series of exposures from a camera fixed to a tripod to record graceful arcing startrails, the brightest trail is actually the Moon. Its broad arc is seen behind the ancient observatory's brass armillary sphere. Compare this picture from the Beijing Ancient Observatory taken in September 2023 to one taken in 1895.","startrails, beijing, ancient, observatory, take, subway, ride, visit, china, find, telescope, starting, astronomer, erected, device, site, enable, measure, track, position, naked-eye, star, planet, large, ornate, astronomical, instrument, standing, observation, platform, today, brightest, celestial, beacon, visible, city, light, time, series, exposure, camera, fixed, tripod, record, graceful, arcing, trail, broad, seen, brass, armillary, compare, picture, taken, september"
Moon Setting Behind Teide Volcano,"These people are not in danger. What is coming down from the left is just the Moon, far in the distance. Luna appears so large here because she is being photographed through a telescopic lens.  What is moving is mostly the Earth, whose spin causes the Moon to slowly disappear behind Mount Teide, a volcano in the Canary Islands off the northwest coast of Africa. The people pictured are 16 kilometers away and  many are facing the camera because they are watching the Sun rise behind the photographer. It is not a coincidence that a full moon rises just when the Sun sets because the Sun is always on the opposite side of the sky from a full moon. The featured video was made in 2018 during the full Milk Moon.  The video is not time-lapse -- this was really how fast the Moon was setting.","moon, setting, teide, volcano, people, danger, coming, left, distance, luna, appears, large, photographed, telescopic, lens, moving, spin, cause, disappear, mount, canary, island, northwest, coast, africa, pictured, kilometer, many, facing, camera, watching, rise, photographer, coincidence, full, opposite, side, featured, video, made, milk, time-lapse, fast"
Plane Crossing Crescent Moon,"No, the Moon is not a bow, and no, it did not shoot out a plane like an arrow. What is pictured is a chance superposition.  The plane's contrail would normally appear white, but the large volume of air toward the rising Sun preferentially knocked away blue light, not only making the sky blue, but giving the reflected trail a bright red hue.  Far in the distance, well behind the plane, the crescent Moon also appears slightly reddened. Captured early last month from Bolton, UK, the featured image was taken so soon after sunrise that the plane was sunlit from below, as was its contrail.  Within minutes, unfortunately, the impromptu sky show ended.  The plane moved out of sight.  The Moon kept rising but became harder to see through a brightening sky.  And the contrail gradually dispersed.","plane, crossing, crescent, moon, shoot, arrow, pictured, chance, superposition, contrail, appear, white, large, volume, rising, knocked, blue, light, making, giving, reflected, trail, bright, appears, reddened, captured, early, last, month, bolton, featured, image, taken, sunrise, sunlit, minute, impromptu, show, ended, moved, sight, kept, became, brightening, dispersed"
Energetic Particle Strikes the Earth,"It was one of the most energetic particles ever known to strike the Earth -- but where did it come from?  Dubbed Amaterasu after the Shinto sun goddess, this particle, as do all cosmic rays that strike the Earth's atmosphere, caused an air shower of electrons, protons, and other elementary particles to spray down onto the Earth below. In the featured illustration, a cosmic ray air shower is pictured striking the Telescope Array in Utah, USA, which recorded the Amaterasu event in 2021 May.  Cosmic ray air showers are common enough that you likely have been in a particle spray yourself, although you likely wouldn't have noticed.  The origin of this energetic particle, likely the nucleus of an atom, remains a mystery in two ways. First, it is not known how any single particle or atomic nucleus can practically acquire so much energy, and second, attempts to trace the particle back to where it originated did not indicate any likely potential source.

Stars Versus Dust in the Carina Nebula,"It's stars versus dust in the Carina Nebula and the stars are winning. More precisely, the energetic light and winds from massive newly formed stars are evaporating and dispersing the dusty stellar nurseries in which they formed. Located in the Carina Nebula and inside a region known informally as Mystic Mountain, these pillars' appearance is dominated by opaque brown dust even though it is composed mostly of clear hydrogen gas. Even though some of the dust pillars look like torches, their ends are not on fire -- rather, they are illuminated by nearby stars.  About 7,500 light-years distant, the featured image was taken with the Hubble Space Telescope and highlights an interior region of Carina known as HH1066 which spans nearly a  light year. Within a few million years, the stars will likely win out completely and the dust torches will completely evaporate.","star, versus, dust, carina, nebula, winning, energetic, light, massive, formed, evaporating, dispersing, dusty, stellar, nursery, located, region, known, mystic, mountain, pillar, appearance, dominated, opaque, brown, composed, clear, hydrogen, look, torch, fire, illuminated, nearby, light-year, distant, featured, image, taken, hubble, space, telescope, highlight, interior, hh1066, span, year, likely, evaporate"
Orion and the Ocean of Storms,"On December 5, 2022, a camera on board the uncrewed Orion spacecraft captured this view as Orion approached its return powered flyby of the Moon.  Beyond one of Orion's extended solar arrays lies dark, smooth, terrain along the western edge of the Oceanus Procellarum. Prominent on the lunar nearside Oceanus Procellarum, the Ocean of Storms, is the largest of the Moon's lava-flooded maria. The lunar terminator, shadow line between lunar night and day, runs along the left of this frame. The 41 kilometer diameter crater Marius is top center, with ray crater Kepler peeking in at the edge, just right of the solar array wing. Kepler's bright rays extend to the north and west, reaching the dark-floored Marius. By December 11, 2022 the Orion spacecraft had reached its home world. The historic Artemis 1 mission ended with Orion's successful splashdown in planet Earth's water-flooded Pacific Ocean.","orion, ocean, storm, december, camera, board, uncrewed, spacecraft, captured, view, approached, return, powered, flyby, moon, extended, solar, array, dark, smooth, terrain, western, edge, procellarum, prominent, lunar, oceanus, largest, lava-flooded, maria, terminator, shadow, line, night, left, frame, kilometer, diameter, crater, marius, center, kepler, peeking, wing, bright, extend, north, west, reaching, dark-floored, reached, home, world, historic, artemis, mission, ended, successful, splashdown, planet, earth, water-flooded, pacific"
Vega and Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks,"On December 4, periodic Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks shared this telescopic field of view with Vega, alpha star of the northern constellation Lyra. Fifth brightest star in planet Earth's night, Vega is some 25 light-years distant while the much fainter comet was about 21 light-minutes away. In recent months, outbursts have caused dramatic increases in brightness for Pons-Brooks though. Nicknamed the Devil Comet for its hornlike appearance, fans of interstellar spaceflight have also suggested the distorted shape of this large comet's central coma looks like the Millenium Falcon. A Halley-type comet, 12P/Pons-Brooks last visited the inner Solar System in 1954. Its next perihelion passage or closest approach to the Sun will be April 21, 2024. That's just two weeks after the April 8 total solar eclipse path crosses North America. But, highly inclined to the Solar System's ecliptic plane, the orbit of periodic Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks will never cross the orbit of planet Earth.","vega, comet, 12p/pons-brooks, december, periodic, shared, telescopic, field, view, alpha, star, northern, constellation, lyra, fifth, brightest, planet, earth, night, light-year, distant, much, fainter, light-minutes, recent, month, caused, dramatic, increase, brightness, pons-brooks, nicknamed, devil, hornlike, appearance, interstellar, spaceflight, suggested, distorted, shape, large, central, coma, look, millenium, falcon, halley-type, last, visited, inner, solar, system, next, perihelion, passage, closest, approach, april, week, total, eclipse, path, cross, north, inclined, ecliptic, plane, orbit"
Pic du Pleiades,"Near dawn on November 19 the Pleiades stood in still dark skies over the French Pyrenees. But just before sunrise a serendipitous moment was captured in this single 3 second exposure; a bright meteor streak appeared to pierce the heart of the galactic star cluster. From the camera's perspective, star cluster and meteor were poised directly above the mountain top observatory on the Pic du Midi de Bigorre. And though astronomers might consider the Pleiades to be relatively close by, the grain of dust vaporizing as it plowed through planet Earth's upper atmosphere actually missed the cluster's tight grouping of young stars by about 400 light-years. While recording a night sky timelapse series, the camera and telephoto lens were fixed to a tripod on the Tour-de-France-cycled slopes of the Col du Tourmalet about 5 kilometers from the Pic du Midi.","pleiades, dawn, stood, dark, french, pyrenees, sunrise, serendipitous, moment, captured, single, second, exposure, bright, meteor, streak, appeared, pierce, heart, galactic, star, cluster, camera, perspective, poised, mountain, observatory, midi, astronomer, consider, close, grain, dust, vaporizing, plowed, planet, earth, upper, atmosphere, missed, tight, grouping, young, light-year, recording, night, timelapse, series, telephoto, lens, fixed, tripod, tour-de-france-cycled, slope, tourmalet, kilometer"
Big Dipper over Pyramid Mountain,"When did you first learn to identify this group of stars? Although they are familiar to many people around the world, different cultures have associated this asterism with different icons and folklore. Known in the USA as the Big Dipper, the stars are part of a constellation designated by the International Astronomical Union in 1922 as the Great Bear (Ursa Major).  The recognized star names of these stars are (left to right) Alkaid, Mizar/Alcor, Alioth, Megrez, Phecda, Merak, and Dubhe.  Of course, stars in any given constellation are unlikely to be physically related. But surprisingly, most of the Big Dipper stars do seem to be headed in the same direction as they plough through space, a property they share with other stars spread out over an even larger area across the sky.  Their measured common motion suggests that they all belong to a loose, nearby star cluster, thought to be on average only about 75 light-years away and up to 30 light-years across. The cluster is more properly known as the Ursa Major Moving Group. The featured image captured the iconic stars in 2017 above Pyramid Mountain in Alberta, Canada.

Solar Minimum versus Solar Maximum,"The surface of our Sun is constantly changing.  Some years it is quiet, showing relatively few sunspots and active regions. Other years it is churning, showing many sunspots and throwing frequent Coronal Mass Ejections (CMEs) and flares. Reacting to magnetism, our Sun's surface goes through periods of relative calm, called Solar Minimum and relative unrest, called Solar Maximum, every 11 years. The featured video shows on the left a month in late 2019 when the Sun was near Solar Minimum, while on the right a month in 2014 when near Solar Maximum.  The video was taken by NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory in far ultraviolet light. Our Sun is progressing again toward Solar Maximum in 2025, but displaying even now a surface with a surprisingly high amount of activity.

Aurora and Milky Way over Norway,"What are these two giant arches across the sky? Perhaps the more familiar one, on the left, is the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy. This grand disk of stars and nebulas here appears to encircle much of the southern sky. Visible below the stellar arch is the rusty-orange planet Mars and the extended Andromeda galaxy. But this night had more!  For a few minutes during this cold arctic night, a second giant arch appeared  encircling part of the northern sky: an aurora. Auroras are much closer than stars as they are composed of glowing air high in Earth's atmosphere.  Visible outside the green auroral arch is the group of stars popularly known as the Big Dipper.  The featured digital composite of 20 images was captured in mid-November 2022 over the Lofoten Islands in Norway.

Deep Field: The Heart Nebula,"What excites the Heart Nebula? First, the large emission nebula on the left, catalogued as IC 1805, looks somewhat like a human heart.  The nebula glows brightly in red light emitted by its most prominent element, hydrogen, but this long-exposure image was also blended with light emitted by silicon (yellow) and oxygen (blue).  In the center of the Heart Nebula are young stars from the open star cluster Melotte 15 that are eroding away several picturesque dust pillars with their atom-exciting energetic light and winds. The Heart Nebula is located about 7,500 light years away toward the constellation of Cassiopeia.  At the bottom right of the Heart Nebula is the companion Fishhead Nebula.  This wide and deep image clearly shows, though, that glowing gas surrounds the Heart Nebula in all directions.

Supernova Remnant Cassiopeia A,"Massive stars in our Milky Way Galaxy live spectacular lives.  Collapsing from vast cosmic clouds, their nuclear furnaces ignite and create heavy elements in their cores. After only a few million years for the most massive stars, the enriched material is blasted back into interstellar space where star formation can begin anew. The expanding debris cloud known as Cassiopeia A is an example of this final phase of the stellar life cycle. Light from the supernova explosion that created this remnant would have been first seen in planet Earth's sky about 350 years ago, although it took that light 11,000 years to reach us. This sharp NIRCam image from the James Webb Space Telescope shows the still hot filaments and knots in the supernova remnant. The whitish, smoke-like outer shell of the expanding blast wave is about 20 light-years across.

Betelgeuse Eclipsed,"Asteroid 319 Leona cast a shadow across planet Earth on December 12, as it passed in front of bright star Betelgeuse. But to see everyone's favorite red giant star fade this time, you had to stand near the center line of the narrow shadow path starting in central Mexico and extending eastward across southern Florida, the Atlantic Ocean, southern Europe, and Eurasia. The geocentric celestial event was captured in these two panels taken at Almodovar del Rio, Spain from before (left) and during the asteroid-star occultation. In both panels Betelgeuse is seen above and left, at the shoulder of the familiar constellation Orion. Its brightness diminishes noticeably during the exceedingly rare occultation when, for several seconds, the giant star was briefly eclipsed by a roughly 60 kilometer diameter main-belt asteroid.","betelgeuse, eclipsed, asteroid, leona, cast, shadow, planet, earth, december, passed, front, bright, star, everyone, favorite, giant, fade, time, stand, center, line, narrow, path, starting, central, mexico, extending, southern, florida, atlantic, ocean, europe, eurasia, geocentric, celestial, event, captured, panel, taken, almodovar, spain, left, asteroid-star, occultation, seen, shoulder, familiar, constellation, orion, brightness, diminishes, rare, several, second, briefly, kilometer, diameter, main-belt"
Crescent Enceladus,"Peering from the shadows, the Saturn-facing hemisphere of tantalizing inner moon Enceladus poses in this Cassini spacecraft image. North is up in the dramatic scene captured during November 2016 as Cassini's camera was pointed in a nearly sunward direction about 130,000 kilometers from the moon's bright crescent. In fact, the distant world reflects over 90 percent of the sunlight it receives, giving its surface about the same reflectivity as fresh snow. A mere 500 kilometers in diameter, Enceladus is a surprisingly active moon. Data and images collected during Cassini's flybys have revealed water vapor and ice grains spewing from south polar geysers and evidence of an ocean of liquid water hidden beneath the moon's icy crust.","crescent, enceladus, peering, shadow, saturn-facing, hemisphere, tantalizing, inner, moon, pose, cassini, spacecraft, image, north, dramatic, scene, captured, november, camera, pointed, sunward, direction, kilometer, bright, fact, distant, world, reflects, percent, sunlight, receives, giving, surface, reflectivity, fresh, snow, diameter, active, data, collected, flybys, revealed, water, vapor, grain, spewing, south, polar, geyser, evidence, ocean, liquid, hidden, beneath, crust"
Geminids over China's Nianhu Lake,"Where are all of these meteors coming from?  In terms of direction on the sky, the pointed answer is the constellation of Gemini.  That is why the major meteor shower in December is known as the Geminids -- because shower meteors all appear to come from a radiant toward Gemini. Three dimensionally, however, sand-sized debris expelled from the unusual asteroid 3200 Phaethon follows a well-defined orbit about our Sun, and the part of the orbit that approaches Earth is superposed in front of the constellation of Gemini. Therefore, when Earth crosses this orbit, the radiant point of falling debris appears in Gemini. Featured here is a composite of many images taken a few days ago through dark skies from Nianhu Lake in China. Over 100 bright meteor streaks from the Geminids meteor shower are visible.

The Same Color Illusion,"Are squares A and B the same color? They are! To verify this, either run your cursor over the image or click here to see them connected.  The featured illusion, an example of the same color illusion, illustrates that purely human perceptions in science may be ambiguous or inaccurate, even such a seemingly direct perception as relative color.  Similar illusions exist on the sky, such as the size of the Moon near the horizon, or the apparent shapes of astronomical objects.  The advent of automated, reproducible measuring devices such as CCDs have made science in general and astronomy in particular less prone to, but not free of, human-biased illusions.

NGC 1499: The California Nebula,"Could Queen Calafia's mythical island exist in space? Perhaps not, but by chance the outline of this molecular space cloud echoes the outline of the state of California, USA. Our Sun has its home within the Milky Way's Orion Arm, only about 1,000 light-years from the California Nebula. Also known as NGC 1499, the classic emission nebula is around 100 light-years long. On the featured image, the most prominent glow of the California Nebula is the red light characteristic of hydrogen atoms recombining with long lost electrons, stripped away (ionized) by energetic starlight. The star most likely providing the energetic starlight that ionizes much of the nebular gas is the bright, hot, bluish Xi Persei just to the right of the nebula.  A regular target for astrophotographers, the California Nebula can be spotted with a wide-field telescope under a dark sky toward the constellation of Perseus, not far from the Pleiades.

Ice Halos over Bavaria,"What's causing those unusual sky arcs? Ice crystals.  While crossing a field of fresh snow near Füssen, Bavaria, Germany, earlier this month, the photographer noticed that he had entered an ice fog.  For suspended water to freeze into an ice fog requires quite cold temperatures, and indeed the air temperature on this day was measured at well below zero.  The ice fog reflected light from the Sun setting behind St. Coleman Church.  The result was one of the greatest spectacles the photographer has ever seen. First, the spots in the featured picture are not background stars but suspended ice and snow. Next, two prominent ice halos are visible: the 22-degree halo and the 46-degree halo. Multiple arcs are also visible, including, from top to bottom, antisolar (subsun), circumzenithal, Parry, tangent, and parhelic (horizontal). Finally, the balloon shaped curve connecting the top arc to the Sun is the rarest of all: it is the heliac arc, created by reflection from the sides of hexagonally shaped ice crystals suspended in a horizontal orientation.","halo, bavaria, causing, unusual, crystal, crossing, field, fresh, snow, füssen, germany, earlier, month, noticed, entered, suspended, water, freeze, requires, cold, temperature, measured, reflected, light, setting, coleman, church, result, greatest, spectacle, photographer, seen, first, spot, featured, picture, background, star, prominent, visible, 22-degree, 46-degree, multiple, including, bottom, antisolar, subsun, circumzenithal, parry, tangent, parhelic, horizontal, balloon, shaped, curve, connecting, rarest, heliac, created, reflection, side, orientation"
Three Galaxies and a Comet,"Distant galaxies abound in this one degree wide field of view toward the southern constellation Grus (The Crane). But the three spiral galaxies at the lower right are quite striking. In fact, all three galaxies are grouped about 70 million light years away and sometimes known as the Grus Triplet. They share the pretty telescopic frame, recorded on December 13, with the comet designated C/2020 V2 ZTF. Now outbound from the inner Solar System and swinging below the ecliptic plane in a hyperbolic orbit, the comet was about 29 light-minutes from our fair planet in this image. And though this comet ZTF was brighter when it was closest to the Sun last May and closest to Earth in September of 2023, it still shines in telescopes pointed toward southern night skies, remaining almost as bright as the Grus Triplet galaxies.","galaxy, comet, distant, degree, wide, field, view, southern, constellation, grus, crane, spiral, lower, right, striking, fact, grouped, light, year, known, triplet, share, pretty, telescopic, frame, recorded, designated, c/2020, inner, solar, system, swinging, ecliptic, plane, hyperbolic, orbit, light-minutes, fair, planet, image, brighter, closest, last, earth, september, shine, telescope, pointed, night, remaining, bright"
183 Days in the Sun,"A single 183 day exposure with a pinhole camera and photographic paper resulted in this long-duration solargraph. Recorded from solstice to solstice, June 21 to December 21, in 2022, it follows the Sun's daily arcing path through planet Earth's skies from Mertola, Portugal. On June 21, the Sun's highest point and longest arc represents the longest day and the astronomical beginning of summer in the northern hemisphere. The solstice date with the fewest hours of daylight is at the beginning of winter in the north, corresponding to the Sun's shortest and lowest arc in the 2022 solargraph. For 2023, the northern winter solstice was on December 22 at 3:27 UTC.

A December Summer Night,"Colours of a serene evening sky are captured in this 8 minute exposure, made near this December's solstice from New Zealand, southern hemisphere, planet Earth. Looking south, star trails form the short concentric arcs around the rotating planet's south celestial pole positioned just off the top of the frame. At top and left of center are trails of the Southern Cross stars and a dark smudge from the Milky Way's Coalsack Nebula. Alpha and Beta Centauri make the brighter yellow and blue tinted trails, reflected below in the waters of Hoopers Inlet in the Pacific coast of the South Island's Otago Peninsula. On that short December summer night, aurora australis also gave luminous, green and reddish hues to the sky above the hills. Aurora shine as atoms and molecules in the upper atmosphere are excited by collisions with energetic particles. An upper atmospheric glow distinct from the aurora, a pale greenish airglow caused by a cascade of chemical reactions excited by sunlight, can be traced in diagonal bands at top left.","december, summer, night, colour, serene, evening, captured, minute, exposure, made, solstice, zealand, southern, hemisphere, planet, earth, looking, south, star, trail, form, short, concentric, rotating, celestial, pole, positioned, frame, left, center, cross, dark, smudge, milky, coalsack, nebula, alpha, beta, centauri, make, brighter, yellow, blue, tinted, reflected, water, hoopers, inlet, pacific, coast, island, otago, peninsula, aurora, australis, gave, luminous, green, reddish, hill, shine, atom, molecule, excited, collision, energetic, particle, upper, atmospheric, glow, distinct, pale, greenish, airglow, caused, cascade, chemical, reaction, sunlight, traced, diagonal, band"
NGC 2440: Cocoon of a New White Dwarf,"What's that in the center?  Like a butterfly, a white dwarf star begins its life by casting off a cocoon of gas that enclosed its former self.  In this analogy, however, the Sun would be a caterpillar and the ejected shell of gas would become the prettiest cocoon of all.  In the featured cocoon, the planetary nebula designated NGC 2440 contains one of the hottest white dwarf stars known.  The white dwarf can be seen as the bright orange dot near the image center.  Our Sun will eventually become a white dwarf butterfly, but not for another 5 billion years.","cocoon, white, dwarf, center, butterfly, star, begin, life, casting, enclosed, former, self, analogy, caterpillar, ejected, shell, become, prettiest, featured, planetary, nebula, designated, contains, hottest, known, seen, bright, orange, image, year"
"Cathedral, Mountain, Moon","Single shots like this require planning.  The first step is to realize that such an amazing triple-alignment actually takes place. The second step is to find the best location to photograph it. But it was the third step: being there at exactly the right time -- and when the sky was clear -- that was the hardest. Five times over six years the photographer tried and found bad weather.  Finally, just ten days ago, the weather was perfect, and a photographic dream was realized. Taken in Piemonte, Italy, the cathedral in the foreground is the Basilica of Superga, the mountain in the middle is Monviso, and, well, you know which moon is in the background. Here, even though the setting Moon was captured in a crescent phase, the exposure was long enough for doubly reflected Earthlight, called the da Vinci glow, to illuminate the entire top of the Moon.

IC 443: The Jellyfish Nebula,"Why is this jellyfish swimming in a sea of stars? Drifting near bright star Eta Geminorum, seen at the right, the Jellyfish Nebula extends its tentacles from the bright arcing ridge of emission left of center.  In fact, the cosmic jellyfish is part of bubble-shaped supernova remnant IC 443, the expanding debris cloud from a massive star that exploded.  Light from the explosion first reached planet Earth over 30,000 years ago.  Like its cousin in astronomical waters, the Crab Nebula supernova remnant IC 443 is known to harbor a neutron star -- the remnant of the collapsed stellar core.  The Jellyfish Nebula is about 5,000 light-years away.  At that distance, the featured image would span about 140 light-years across.

Rainbow Aurora over Icelandic Waterfall,"Yes, but can your aurora do this? First, yes, auroras can look like rainbows even though they are completely different phenomena. Auroras are caused by Sun-created particles being channeled into Earth's atmosphere by Earth's magnetic field, and create colors by exciting atoms at different heights. Conversely, rainbows are created by sunlight backscattering off falling raindrops, and different colors are refracted by slightly different angles.  Unfortunately, auroras can’t create waterfalls, but if you plan well and are lucky enough, you can photograph them together. The featured picture is composed of several images taken on the same night last November near the Skógafoss waterfall in Iceland. The planning centered on capturing the central band of our Milky Way galaxy over the picturesque cascade. By luck, a spectacular aurora soon appeared just below the curving arch of the Milky Way. Far in the background, the Pleiades star cluster and the Andromeda galaxy can be found.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

Jupiter and the Geminid,"For a brief moment, this brilliant fireball meteor outshone Jupiter in planet Earth's night. The serendipitous image was captured while hunting meteors under cold Canadian skies with a camera in timelapse mode on December 14, near the peak of the Geminid meteor shower. The Geminid meteor shower, asteroid 3200 Phaethon's annual gift, always arrives in December. Dust shed along the orbit of the mysterious asteroid causes the meteor streaks, as the vaporizing grains plow through our fair planet's upper atmosphere at 22 kilometers per second. Of course Geminid shower meteors appear to radiate from a point in the constellation of the Twins. That's below and left of this frame.

Shakespeare in Space,"In 1986, Voyager 2 became the only spacecraft to explore ice giant planet Uranus close up. Still, this newly released image from the NIRCam (Near-Infrared Camera) on the James Webb Space Telescope offers a detailed look at the distant world. The tilted outer planet rotates on its axis once in about 17 hours. Its north pole is presently pointed near our line of sight, offering direct views of its northern hemisphere and a faint but extensive system of rings. Of the giant planet's 27 known moons, 14 are annotated in the image. Mixed with fuzzy background galaxies, the brighter moons show hints of Webb's characteristic diffraction spikes. And though these worlds of the outer Solar System were unknown in Shakespearean times, all but two of the 27 Uranian moons are named for characters in the English bard's plays.","shakespeare, space, voyager, became, spacecraft, explore, giant, planet, uranus, released, image, nircam, near-infrared, camera, james, webb, telescope, offer, detailed, look, distant, world, tilted, outer, rotates, axis, hour, north, pole, pointed, near, line, sight, offering, direct, view, northern, faint, extensive, system, ring, known, moon, annotated, mixed, fuzzy, background, galaxy, brighter, show, hint, characteristic, diffraction, solar, unknown, shakespearean, time, uranian, named, character, english, bard, play"
The Persistence of Moonlight,"Known to some in the northern hemisphere as December's Cold Moon or the Long Night Moon, the last full moon of 2023 is rising in this surreal mountain and skyscape. The Daliesque scene was captured in a single exposure with a camera and long telephoto lens near Monte Grappa, Italy. The full moon is not melting, though. Its stretched and distorted appearance near the horizon is caused as refraction along the line of sight changes and creates shifting images or mirages of the bright lunar disk. The changes in atmospheric refraction correspond to atmospheric layers with sharply different temperatures and densities. Other effects of atmospheric refraction produced by the long sight-line to this full moon rising include the thin red rim seen faintly on the distorted lower edge of the Moon and a thin green rim along the top.","persistence, moonlight, known, hemisphere, december, cold, moon, night, last, full, rising, surreal, mountain, skyscape, daliesque, scene, captured, single, exposure, camera, telephoto, lens, monte, grappa, italy, melting, stretched, distorted, appearance, horizon, caused, refraction, line, sight, change, creates, shifting, image, mirage, bright, lunar, disk, atmospheric, correspond, layer, different, temperature, density, effect, produced, sight-line, include, thin, seen, lower, edge, green"
Illustris: A Simulation of the Universe,"How did we get here? Click play, sit back, and watch.  A computer simulation of the evolution of the universe provides insight into how galaxies formed and perspectives into humanity's place in the universe.  The Illustris project exhausted 20 million CPU hours in 2014 following 12 billion resolution elements spanning a cube 35 million light years on a side as it evolved over 13 billion years. The simulation tracks matter into the formation of a wide variety of galaxy types. As the virtual universe evolves, some of the matter expanding with the universe soon gravitationally condenses to form filaments, galaxies, and clusters of galaxies. The featured video takes the perspective of a virtual camera circling part of this changing universe, first showing the evolution of dark matter, then hydrogen gas coded by temperature (0:45), then heavy elements such as helium and carbon (1:30), and then back to dark matter (2:07). On the lower left the time since the Big Bang is listed, while on the lower right the type of matter being shown is listed.  Explosions (0:50) depict galaxy-center supermassive black holes expelling bubbles of hot gas.

NGC 1232: A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy,"Galaxies are fascinating not only for what is visible, but for what is invisible. Grand spiral galaxy NGC 1232, captured in detail by one of the Very Large Telescopes, is a good example.  The visible is dominated by millions of bright stars and dark dust, caught up in a gravitational swirl of spiral arms revolving about the center. Open clusters containing bright blue stars can be seen sprinkled along these spiral arms, while dark lanes of dense interstellar dust can be seen sprinkled between them. Less visible, but detectable, are billions of dim normal stars and vast tracts of interstellar gas, together wielding such high mass that they dominate the dynamics of the inner galaxy.  Leading theories indicate that even greater amounts of matter are invisible, in a form we don't yet know. This pervasive dark matter is postulated, in part, to explain the motions of the visible matter in the outer regions of galaxies.

Rocket Transits Rippling Moon,"Can a rocket make the Moon ripple? No, but it can make a background moon appear wavy.  The rocket, in this case, was a SpaceX Falcon Heavy that blasted off from NASA's Kennedy Space Center last week. In the featured launch picture, the rocket's exhaust plume glows beyond its projection onto the distant, rising, and nearly full moon.  Oddly, the Moon's lower edge shows unusual drip-like ripples. The Moon itself, far in the distance, was really unchanged.  The physical cause of these apparent ripples was pockets of relatively hot or rarefied air deflecting moonlight less strongly than pockets of relatively cool or compressed air: refraction. Although the shot was planned, the timing of the launch had to be just right for the rocket to be transiting the Moon during this single exposure.","rocket, transit, rippling, moon, make, ripple, background, appear, wavy, case, spacex, falcon, heavy, blasted, kennedy, space, center, last, week, featured, launch, picture, exhaust, plume, glow, projection, distant, rising, full, lower, edge, show, unusual, drip-like, distance, unchanged, physical, cause, apparent, pocket, rarefied, deflecting, moonlight, less, cool, compressed, refraction, shot, planned, timing, transiting, single, exposure"
A SAR Arc from New Zealand,"What is that unusual red halo surrounding this aurora?  It is a Stable Auroral Red (SAR) arc. SAR arcs are rare and have only been acknowledged and studied since 1954.  The featured wide-angle photograph, capturing nearly an entire SAR arc surrounding more common green and red aurora, was taken earlier this month from Poolburn, New Zealand, during an especially energetic geomagnetic storm. Why SAR arcs form remains a topic of research, but is likely related to Earth's protective magnetic field, a field created by molten iron flowing deep inside the Earth.  This magnetic field usually redirects incoming charged particles from the Sun's wind toward the Earth's poles. However, it also traps a ring of ions closer to the equator, where they can gain energy from the magnetosphere during high solar activity. The energetic electrons in this ion ring can collide with and excite oxygen higher in Earth's ionosphere than typical auroras, causing the oxygen to glow red. Ongoing research has uncovered evidence that a red SAR arc can even transform into a purple and green STEVE.","zealand, unusual, halo, surrounding, aurora, stable, auroral, rare, acknowledged, studied, featured, wide-angle, photograph, capturing, entire, common, green, taken, month, poolburn, energetic, geomagnetic, storm, form, remains, topic, research, related, earth, protective, magnetic, field, created, molten, iron, flowing, deep, redirects, incoming, charged, particle, wind, pole, trap, ring, closer, equator, gain, energy, high, solar, activity, electron, collide, oxygen, higher, ionosphere, typical, causing, glow, ongoing, uncovered, evidence, transform, purple, steve"
Zeta Oph: Runaway Star,"Like a ship plowing through cosmic seas, runaway star Zeta Ophiuchi produces the arcing interstellar bow wave or bow shock seen in this stunning infrared portrait. In the false-color view, bluish Zeta Oph, a star about 20 times more massive than the Sun, lies near the center of the frame, moving toward the left at 24 kilometers per second. Its strong stellar wind precedes it, compressing and heating the dusty interstellar material and shaping the curved shock front. What set this star in motion? Zeta Oph was likely once a member of a binary star system, its companion star was more massive and hence shorter lived. When the companion exploded as a supernova catastrophically losing mass, Zeta Oph was flung out of the system.  About 460 light-years away, Zeta Oph is 65,000 times more luminous than the Sun and would be one of the brighter stars in the sky if it weren't surrounded by obscuring dust. The image spans about 1.5 degrees or 12 light-years at the estimated distance of Zeta Ophiuchi. In January 2020, NASA placed the Spitzer Space Telescope in safe mode, ending its 16 successful years of exploring the cosmos.","zeta, runaway, star, ship, plowing, cosmic, ophiuchi, produce, arcing, interstellar, wave, shock, seen, stunning, infrared, portrait, false-color, view, bluish, time, massive, center, frame, moving, kilometer, second, strong, stellar, wind, precedes, compressing, heating, dusty, material, shaping, curved, front, motion, likely, member, binary, system, companion, hence, shorter, lived, exploded, supernova, losing, mass, flung, light-year, luminous, brighter, surrounded, obscuring, dust, image, span, degree, estimated, distance, january, nasa, placed, spitzer, space, telescope, safe, mode, ending, successful, year, exploring, cosmos"
Trapezium: At the Heart of Orion,"Near the center of this sharp cosmic portrait, at the heart of the Orion Nebula, are four hot, massive stars known as the Trapezium. Gathered within a region about 1.5 light-years in radius, they dominate the core of the dense Orion Nebula Star Cluster. Ultraviolet ionizing radiation from the Trapezium stars, mostly from the brightest star Theta-1 Orionis C powers the complex star forming region's entire visible glow. About three million years old, the Orion Nebula Cluster was even more compact in its younger years and a dynamical study indicates that runaway stellar collisions at an earlier age may have formed a black hole with more than 100 times the mass of the Sun. The presence of a black hole within the cluster could explain the observed high velocities of the Trapezium stars. The Orion Nebula's distance of some 1,500 light-years would make it one of the closest known black holes to planet Earth.","trapezium, heart, orion, center, sharp, cosmic, portrait, massive, star, known, gathered, region, light-year, radius, dominate, core, dense, cluster, ultraviolet, ionizing, radiation, brightest, theta-1, orionis, power, complex, forming, entire, visible, glow, year, nebula, compact, younger, dynamical, study, indicates, stellar, collision, formed, black, hole, time, mass, presence, explain, observed, high, velocity, distance, make, closest, planet, earth"
The Snows of Churyumov-Gerasimenko,"You couldn't really be caught in this blizzard while standing by a cliff on periodic comet 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko. Orbiting the comet in June of 2016, the Rosetta spacecraft's narrow angle camera did record streaks of dust and ice particles similar to snow as they drifted across the field of view close to the camera and above the comet's surface. Still, some of the bright specks in the scene are likely due to a rain of energetic charged particles or cosmic rays hitting the camera, and the dense background of stars in the direction of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). In the video, the background stars are easy to spot trailing from top to bottom. The stunning movie was constructed from 33 consecutive images taken over 25 minutes while Rosetta cruised some 13 kilometers from the comet's nucleus. In September 2016, the nucleus became the final resting place for the Rosetta spacecraft after its mission was ended with a successful controlled impact on 67P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko.","snow, churyumov-gerasimenko, caught, blizzard, standing, cliff, periodic, comet, 67p/churyumov-gerasimenko, orbiting, june, rosetta, spacecraft, narrow, angle, camera, record, streak, dust, particle, similar, drifted, field, view, close, surface, bright, speck, scene, likely, rain, energetic, charged, cosmic, hitting, dense, background, star, direction, constellation, canis, major, video, easy, spot, trailing, bottom, stunning, movie, constructed, consecutive, image, taken, minute, cruised, kilometer, nucleus, september, became, final, resting, place, mission, ended, successful, controlled, impact"
The Cat's Eye Nebula in Optical and X-ray,"To some it looks like a cat's eye. To others, perhaps like a giant cosmic conch shell.  It is actually one of the brightest and most highly detailed planetary nebula known, composed of gas expelled in the brief yet glorious phase near the end of life of a Sun-like star. This nebula's dying central star may have produced the outer circular concentric shells by shrugging off outer layers in a series of regular convulsions. The formation of the beautiful, complex-yet-symmetric inner structures, however, is not well understood. The featured image is a composite of a digitally sharpened Hubble Space Telescope image with X-ray light captured by the orbiting Chandra Observatory.  The exquisite floating space statue spans over half a light-year across.

The Phases of Venus,"Venus goes through phases.  Just like our Moon, Venus can appear as a full circular disk, a thin crescent, or anything in between.  Venus, frequently the brightest object in the post-sunset or pre-sunrise sky, appears so small, however, that it usually requires binoculars or a small telescope to clearly see its current phase.  The featured time-lapse sequence was taken over the course of six months in 2015 from Surgères, Charente-Maritime, France, and shows not only how Venus changes phase, but changes angular size as well. When Venus is on the far side of the Sun from the Earth, it appears angularly smallest and nearest to full phase, while when Venus and Earth are on the same side of the Sun, Venus appears larger, but as a crescent.

Thor's Helmet,"Thor not only has his own day (Thursday), but a helmet in the heavens.  Popularly called Thor's Helmet, NGC 2359 is a hat-shaped cosmic cloud with wing-like appendages. Heroically sized even for a Norse god, Thor's Helmet is about 30 light-years across. In fact, the cosmic head-covering is more like an interstellar bubble, blown with a fast wind from the bright, massive star near the bubble's center. Known as a Wolf-Rayet star, the central star is an extremely hot giant thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova stage of evolution. NGC 2359 is located about 15,000 light-years away toward the constellation of the Great Overdog. This remarkably sharp image is a mixed cocktail of data from  narrowband filters, capturing not only natural looking stars but details of the nebula's filamentary structures.

"The Light, the Dark, and the Dusty","This colorful skyscape spans about three full moons across nebula rich starfields along the plane of our Milky Way Galaxy toward the royal northern constellation Cepheus. Near the edge of the region's massive molecular cloud some 2,400 light-years away, bright reddish emission region Sharpless (Sh)2-155 is at the center of the frame, also known as the Cave Nebula. About 10 light-years across the cosmic cave's bright walls of gas are ionized by ultraviolet light from the hot young stars around it. Dusty bluish reflection nebulae, like vdB 155 at the left, and dense obscuring clouds of dust also abound on the interstellar canvas.

Quadrantids of the North,"Named for a forgotten constellation, the Quadrantid Meteor Shower puts on an annual show for planet Earth's northern hemisphere skygazers. The shower's radiant on the sky lies within the old, astronomically obsolete constellation Quadrans Muralis. That location is not far from the Big Dipper asterism, known to some as the Plough, at the boundaries of the modern constellations Bootes and Draco. The Big Dipper ""handle"" stars are near the upper right corner in this frame, with the meteor shower radiant just below. North star Polaris is toward the top left. Pointing back toward the radiant, Quadrantid meteors streak through the night in this skyscape from Jangsu, South Korea.

Good Morning Moon,"Yesterday, the Moon was New. But on January 9, early morning risers around planet Earth were treated to the sight of an old Moon, low in the east as the sky grew bright before dawn. Above the city of Saarburg in Rhineland-Palatinate, western Germany, this simple snapshot found the waning Moon's sunlit crescent just before sunrise. But also never wandering far from the Sun in Earth's sky, inner planets Venus and Mercury shared the cold morning skyview.

Circling the Sun,"rth's orbit around the Sun is not a circle, it's an ellipse. The point along its elliptical orbit where our fair planet is closest to the Sun is called perihelion. This year, perihelion was on January 2 at 01:00 UTC, with the Earth about 3 million miles closer to the Sun than it was at aphelion (last July 6), the farthest point in its elliptical orbit. Of course, distance from the Sun doesn't determine the seasons, and it doesn't the determine size of Sun halos. Easier to see with the Sun hidden behind a tall tree trunk, this beautiful ice halo forms a 22 degree-wide circle around the Sun, recorded while strolling through the countryside near Heroldstatt, Germany. The Sun halo's 22 degree angular diameter is determined by the six-sided geometry of water ice crystals drifting high in planet Earth's atmosphere.","circling, orbit, circle, ellipse, point, elliptical, fair, planet, closest, called, perihelion, year, january, earth, mile, closer, aphelion, last, july, farthest, course, distance, determine, season, size, halo, easier, hidden, tall, tree, trunk, beautiful, form, degree-wide, recorded, strolling, countryside, heroldstatt, germany, degree, angular, diameter, determined, six-sided, geometry, water, crystal, drifting, high, atmosphere"
Dragon Aurora over Iceland,"Have you ever seen a dragon in the sky? Although real flying dragons don't exist, a huge dragon-shaped aurora developed in the sky over Iceland in 2019.  The aurora was caused by a hole in the Sun's corona that expelled charged particles into a solar wind that followed a changing interplanetary magnetic field to Earth's magnetosphere.  As some of those particles then struck Earth's atmosphere, they excited atoms which subsequently emitted light: aurora. This iconic display was so enthralling that the photographer's mother ran out to see it and was captured in the foreground.  Our active Sun continues to show an unusually high number of prominences, filaments, sunspots, and large active regions as solar maximum approaches in 2025.","dragon, aurora, iceland, seen, real, flying, exist, huge, dragon-shaped, developed, caused, hole, corona, expelled, charged, particle, solar, wind, followed, changing, interplanetary, magnetic, field, earth, magnetosphere, struck, atmosphere, excited, emitted, light, iconic, display, enthralling, photographer, mother, captured, active, continues, show, high, number, prominence, filament, sunspot, large, region, maximum, approach"
Star Cluster IC 348 from Webb,"Sometimes, it's the stars that are the hardest to see that are the most interesting. IC 348 is a young star cluster that illuminates surrounding filamentary dust.  The stringy and winding dust appears pink in this recently released infrared image from the Webb Space Telescope. In visible light, this dust reflects mostly blue light, giving the surrounding material the familiar blue hue of a reflection nebula.  Besides bright stars, several cool objects have been located in IC 348, visible because they glow brighter in infrared light.  These objects are hypothesized to be low mass brown dwarfs.  Evidence for this includes the detection of an unidentified atmospheric chemical, likely a hydrocarbon, seen previously in the atmosphere of Saturn. These objects appear to have masses slightly greater than known planets, only a few times greater than Jupiter.  Together, these indicate that this young star cluster contains something noteworthy -- young planet-mass brown dwarfs that float free, not orbiting any other star.","star, cluster, webb, interesting, young, illuminates, surrounding, filamentary, dust, stringy, winding, appears, pink, released, infrared, image, space, telescope, visible, light, reflects, blue, giving, material, familiar, reflection, nebula, bright, several, cool, object, located, glow, brighter, hypothesized, mass, brown, dwarf, evidence, includes, detection, unidentified, atmospheric, chemical, likely, hydrocarbon, seen, saturn, appear, greater, known, planet, time, jupiter, indicate, contains, something, noteworthy, planet-mass, float, free, orbiting"
The Orion You Can Almost See,"Do you recognize this constellation?  Although it is one of the most recognizable star groupings on the sky, this is a more full Orion than you can see -- an Orion only revealed with long exposure digital camera imaging and post- processing.  Here the cool red giant Betelgeuse takes on a strong orange tint as the brightest star on the upper left.  Orion's hot blue stars are numerous, with supergiant Rigel balancing Betelgeuse on the lower right, and Bellatrix at the upper right. Lined up in Orion's belt are three stars all about 1,500 light-years away, born from the constellation's well-studied interstellar clouds. Just below Orion's belt is a bright but fuzzy patch that might also look familiar -- the stellar nursery known as Orion's Nebula.

America and the Sea of Serenity,"Get out your red/blue glasses and check out this stereo view of another world. The scene was recorded by Apollo 17 mission commander Eugene Cernan on December 11, 1972, one orbit before descending to land on the Moon. The stereo anaglyph was assembled from two photographs (AS17-147-22465, AS17-147-22466) captured from his vantage point on board the Lunar Module Challenger as he and Dr. Harrison Schmitt flew over Apollo 17's landing site in the Taurus-Littrow Valley. The broad, sunlit face of the mountain dubbed South Massif rises near the center of the frame, above the dark floor of Taurus-Littrow to its left. Piloted by Ron Evans, the Command Module America is visible in orbit in the foreground against the South Massif's peak. Beyond the mountains, toward the lunar limb, lies the Moon's Mare Serenitatis. Four astronauts will venture around the Moon and back again on the Artemis II mission, scheduled for launch no earlier than September 2025.","serenity, red/blue, glass, check, stereo, view, world, scene, recorded, mission, commander, eugene, cernan, orbit, descending, land, moon, anaglyph, assembled, photograph, as17-147-22465, as17-147-22466, captured, vantage, point, board, lunar, module, challenger, harrison, schmitt, flew, landing, site, taurus-littrow, valley, broad, sunlit, face, mountain, dubbed, south, massif, rise, center, frame, dark, floor, left, piloted, evans, command, america, visible, foreground, peak, limb, mare, astronaut, venture, artemis, scheduled, launch, september"
Northern Lights from the Stratosphere,"Northern lights shine in this night skyview from planet Earth's stratosphere, captured on January 15. The single, 5 second exposure was made with a hand-held camera on board an aircraft above Winnipeg, Canada. During the exposure, terrestrial lights below leave colorful trails along the direction of motion of the speeding aircraft. Above the more distant horizon, energetic particles accelerated along Earth's magnetic field at the planet's polar regions excite atomic oxygen to create the shimmering display of Aurora Borealis. The aurora's characteristic greenish hue is generated at altitudes of 100-300 kilometers and red at even higher altitudes and lower atmospheric densities. The luminous glow of faint stars along the plane of our Milky Way galaxy arcs through the night, while the Andromeda galaxy extends this northern skyview to extragalactic space. A diffuse hint of Andromeda, the closest large spiral to the Milky Way, can just be seen to the upper left.","northern, light, stratosphere, shine, night, skyview, planet, earth, captured, january, single, second, exposure, made, hand-held, camera, board, aircraft, canada, terrestrial, leave, colorful, trail, direction, motion, speeding, distant, horizon, energetic, particle, accelerated, magnetic, field, polar, region, atomic, oxygen, create, shimmering, display, aurora, characteristic, greenish, generated, altitude, 100-300, kilometer, higher, atmospheric, density, luminous, glow, faint, star, plane, milky, galaxy, andromeda, extends, extragalactic, space, diffuse, hint, closest, large, spiral, seen, upper, left"
Jupiter over 2 Hours and 30 Minutes,"Jupiter, our Solar System's ruling gas giant, is also the fastest spinning planet, rotating once in less than 10 hours. The gas giant doesn't rotate like a solid body though. A day on Jupiter is about 9 hours and 56 minutes long at the poles, decreasing to 9 hours and 50 minutes near the equator. The giant planet's fast rotation creates strong jet streams, separating its clouds into planet girdling bands of dark belts and bright zones. You can easily follow Jupiter's rapid rotation in this sharp sequence of images from the night of January 15, all taken with a camera and small telescope outside of Paris, France. Located just south of the equator, the giant planet's giant storm system, also known as the Great Red Spot, can be seen moving left to right with the planet's rotation. From lower left to upper right, the sequence spans about 2 hours and 30 minutes.","jupiter, hour, minute, solar, system, ruling, giant, fastest, spinning, planet, rotating, less, rotate, solid, body, long, pole, decreasing, equator, fast, rotation, creates, strong, stream, separating, cloud, girdling, band, dark, belt, bright, follow, rapid, sharp, sequence, image, night, january, taken, camera, small, telescope, paris, france, located, south, storm, known, great, spot, seen, moving, right, left, upper, span"
Falcon Heavy Boostback Burn,"The December 28 night launch of a Falcon Heavy rocket from Kennedy Space Center in Florida marked the fifth launch for the rocket's reusable side boosters. About 2 minutes 20 seconds into the flight, the two side boosters separated from the rocket's core stage. Starting just after booster separation, this three minute long exposure captures the pair's remarkable boostback burns, maneuvers executed prior to their return to landing zones on planet Earth. While no attempt was made to recover the Falcon Heavy's core stage, both side boosters landed successfully and can be flown again. The four previous flights for these side boosters included last October's launch of NASA's asteroid-bound Psyche mission. Their next planned flight is on the Europa Clipper mission scheduled for launch in October 2024.","falcon, heavy, boostback, burn, night, launch, rocket, kennedy, space, center, florida, marked, fifth, reusable, side, booster, minute, second, flight, separated, core, stage, starting, separation, long, exposure, capture, pair, remarkable, maneuver, executed, prior, return, landing, planet, earth, attempt, made, recover, landed, flown, previous, included, last, october, nasa, asteroid-bound, psyche, mission, planned, europa, clipper, scheduled"
The Upper Michigan Blizzard of 1938,"Yes, but can your blizzard do this? In the Upper Peninsula of Michigan's Storm of the Century in 1938, some snow drifts reached the level of utility poles. Nearly a meter of new and unexpected snow fell over two days in a storm that started 86 years ago this week.  As snow fell and gale-force winds piled snow to surreal heights, many roads became not only impassable but unplowable; people became stranded, cars, school buses and a train became mired, and even a dangerous fire raged. Two people were killed and some students were forced to spend several consecutive days at school.  The featured image was taken by a local resident soon after the storm. Although all of this snow eventually melted, repeated snow storms like this help build lasting glaciers in snowy regions of our planet Earth.","upper, blizzard, peninsula, michigan, storm, century, snow, drift, reached, level, utility, pole, unexpected, fell, started, year, week, gale-force, wind, piled, surreal, height, many, road, became, impassable, unplowable, people, stranded, school, train, mired, dangerous, fire, raged, killed, student, forced, spend, several, consecutive, featured, image, taken, local, resident, melted, repeated, help, build, lasting, glacier, snowy, region, planet, earth"
Shadows of Mountain and Moon,"Can the Moon and a mountain really cast similar shadows? Yes, but the division between light and dark does not have to be aligned. Pictured, a quarter moon was captured above the mountain Grivola in Italy in early October of 2022.  The Sun is to the right of the featured picturesque landscape, illuminating the right side of the Moon in a similar way that it illuminates the right side of the mountain. This lunar phase is called ""quarter"", in part, because the lit fraction visible from Earth is one quarter of the entire lunar surface.  Digital post-processing of this single exposure gave both  gigantic objects more prominence. Capturing the terminator of this quarter moon in close alignment with nearly vertical mountain ridge required careful timing because the Earth rotates once a day.","shadow, mountain, moon, cast, similar, division, light, dark, aligned, pictured, quarter, captured, grivola, italy, early, october, right, featured, picturesque, landscape, illuminating, side, illuminates, lunar, phase, called, part, fraction, visible, earth, entire, surface, digital, post-processing, single, exposure, gave, gigantic, object, prominence, capturing, terminator, close, alignment, vertical, ridge, required, careful, timing, rotates"
Deep Nebulas: From Seagull to California,"How well do you know the night sky? OK, but how well can you identify famous sky objects in a very deep image? Either way, here is a test: see if you can find some well-known night-sky icons in a deep image filled with faint nebulosity.  This image contains the Pleiades star cluster, Barnard's Loop, Horsehead Nebula, Orion Nebula, Rosette Nebula, Cone Nebula, Rigel, Jellyfish Nebula, Monkey Head Nebula, Flaming Star Nebula, Tadpole Nebula, Aldebaran, Simeis 147, Seagull Nebula and the California Nebula. To find their real locations, here is an annotated image version.  The reason this task might be difficult is similar to the reason it is initially hard to identify familiar constellations in a very dark sky: the tapestry of our night sky has an extremely deep hidden complexity.  The featured composite reveals some of this complexity in a mosaic of 28 images taken over 800 hours from dark skies over Arizona, USA.","deep, nebula, seagull, california, know, night, famous, object, image, test, well-known, night-sky, icon, filled, faint, nebulosity, contains, pleiades, star, cluster, barnard, loop, horsehead, orion, rosette, cone, rigel, jellyfish, monkey, head, flaming, tadpole, aldebaran, find, real, location, annotated, version, reason, task, difficult, similar, hard, identify, familiar, constellation, dark, tapestry, hidden, complexity, featured, composite, reveals, mosaic, taken, hour, arizona"
Earth and Moon from Beyond,"What do the Earth and Moon look like from beyond the Moon? Although frequently photographed together, the familiar duo was captured with this unusual perspective in late 2022 by the robotic Orion spacecraft of NASA's Artemis I mission as it looped around Earth's most massive satellite and looked back toward its home world. Since our Earth is about four times the diameter of the Moon, the satellite’s seemingly large size was caused by the capsule being closer to the smaller body. Artemis II, the next launch in NASA’s Artemis series, is currently scheduled to take people around the Moon in 2025, while Artemis III is planned to return humans to lunar surface in late 2026. Last week,  JAXA's robotic SLIM spacecraft, launched from Japan, landed on the Moon and released two hopping rovers.

Jyväskylä in the Sky,"You might not immediately recognize this street map of a neighborhood in Jyväskylä, Finland, planet Earth. But that's probably because the map was projected into the night sky and captured with an allsky camera on January 16. The temperature recorded on that northern winter night was around minus 20 degrees Celsius. As ice crystals formed in the atmosphere overhead, street lights spilling illumination into the sky above produced visible light pillars, their ethereal appearance due to specular reflections from the fluttering crystals' flat surfaces. Of course, the projected light pillars trace a map of the brightly lit local streets, though reversed right to left in the upward looking camera's view. This light pillar street map was seen to hover for hours in the Jyväskylä night.","jyväskylä, recognize, street, neighborhood, finland, planet, earth, projected, night, captured, allsky, camera, january, temperature, recorded, northern, winter, degree, celsius, crystal, formed, overhead, light, spilling, illumination, produced, visible, pillar, ethereal, appearance, specular, reflection, fluttering, flat, surface, course, trace, local, reversed, right, left, upward, looking, view, seen, hour"
Epsilon Tauri: Star with Planet,"silon Tauri lies 146 light-years away. A K-type red giant star, epsilon Tau is cooler than the Sun, but with about 13 times the solar radius it shines with nearly 100 times the solar luminosity. A member of the Hyades open star cluster the giant star is known by the proper name Ain, and along with brighter giant star Aldebaran, forms the eyes of Taurus the Bull. Surrounded by dusty, dark clouds in Taurus, epsilon Tau is also known to have a planet. Discovered by radial velocity measurements in 2006, epsilon Tauri b is a gas giant planet larger than Jupiter with an orbital period of 1.6 years. And though the exoplanet can't be seen directly, on a dark night its parent star epsilon Tauri is easily visible to the unaided eye.","epsilon, tauri, star, planet, silon, light-year, k-type, giant, cooler, time, solar, radius, shine, luminosity, member, hyades, open, cluster, known, proper, name, brighter, aldebaran, form, taurus, bull, surrounded, dusty, dark, cloud, discovered, radial, velocity, measurement, larger, jupiter, orbital, period, year, exoplanet, seen, night, parent, visible, unaided"
Full Observatory Moon,"A popular name for January's full moon in the northern hemisphere is the Full Wolf Moon. As the new year's first full moon, it rises over Las Campanas Observatory in this dramatic Earth-and-moonscape. Peering from the foreground like astronomical eyes are the observatory's twin 6.5 meter diameter Magellan telescopes. The snapshot was captured with telephoto lens across rugged terrain in the Chilean Atacama Desert, taken at a distance of about 9 miles from the observatory and about 240,000 miles from the lunar surface. Of course the first full moon of the lunar new year, known to some as the Full Snow Moon, will rise on February 24.","full, observatory, moon, popular, name, january, northern, wolf, year, first, rise, campana, dramatic, earth-and-moonscape, peering, foreground, astronomical, twin, meter, diameter, magellan, telescope, snapshot, captured, telephoto, lens, rugged, terrain, chilean, atacama, desert, taken, distance, mile, lunar, surface, course, known, snow, february"
Pluto in True Color,"What color is Pluto, really? It took some effort to figure out.  Even given all of the images sent back to Earth when the robotic New Horizons spacecraft sped past Pluto in 2015, processing these multi-spectral frames to approximate what the human eye would see was challenging. The result featured here, released three years after the raw data was acquired by New Horizons, is the highest resolution true color image of Pluto ever taken. Visible in the image is the light-colored, heart-shaped, Tombaugh Regio, with the unexpectedly smooth Sputnik Planitia, made of frozen nitrogen, filling its western lobe. New Horizons found the dwarf planet to have a surprisingly complex surface composed of many regions having perceptibly different hues.  In total, though, Pluto is mostly brown, with much of its muted color originating from small amounts of surface methane energized by ultraviolet light from the Sun.

The Pleiades: Seven Dusty Sisters,"The well-known Pleiades star cluster is slowly destroying part of a passing cloud of gas and dust. The Pleiades is the brightest open cluster of stars on Earth's sky and can be seen from almost any northerly location with the unaided eye.  Over the past 100,000 years, a field of gas and dust is moving by chance right through the Pleiades star cluster and is causing a strong reaction between the stars and dust. The passing cloud might be part of the Radcliffe wave, a newly discovered structure of gas and dust connecting several regions of star formation in the nearby part of our Milky Way galaxy.  Pressure from the stars' light significantly repels the dust in the surrounding blue reflection nebula, with smaller dust particles being repelled more strongly.  A short-term result is that parts of the dust cloud have become filamentary and stratified. The featured deep image incorporates nearly 9 hours of exposure and was captured from Utah Desert Remote Observatory in Utah, USA, last year.","pleiades, dusty, sister, well-known, star, cluster, destroying, part, passing, cloud, dust, brightest, open, earth, seen, northerly, location, unaided, year, field, moving, chance, causing, strong, reaction, radcliffe, wave, discovered, structure, connecting, several, region, formation, nearby, milky, galaxy, pressure, light, repels, surrounding, blue, reflection, smaller, particle, repelled, short-term, result, become, filamentary, stratified, featured, deep, image, incorporates, hour, exposure, captured, utah, desert, remote, observatory, last"
SLIM Lands on the Moon,"New landers are on the Moon. Nearly two weeks ago, Japan's Smart Lander for Investigating Moon (SLIM) released two rovers as it descended, before its main lander touched down itself. The larger of the two rovers can hop like a frog, while the smaller rover is about the size of a baseball and can move after pulling itself apart like a transformer. The main lander, nicknamed Moon Sniper, is seen in the featured image taken by the smaller rover. Inspection of the image shows that Moon Sniper's thrusters are facing up, meaning that the lander is upside down from its descent configuration and on its side from its intended landing configuration.  One result is that Moon Sniper's solar panels are not in the expected orientation, so that powering the lander had to be curtailed and adapted.  SLIM's lander has already succeeded as a technology demonstration, its main mission, but was not designed to withstand the lunar night -- which starts tomorrow.","slim, land, moon, lander, week, japan, smart, investigating, released, rover, descended, main, touched, larger, frog, smaller, size, baseball, move, pulling, transformer, nicknamed, sniper, seen, featured, image, taken, inspection, show, thruster, facing, meaning, upside, descent, configuration, side, intended, landing, result, solar, panel, expected, orientation, powering, curtailed, adapted, succeeded, technology, demonstration, mission, designed, lunar, night, start, tomorrow"
Camera Orion Rising,"What does Orion rising look like to a camera? During this time of the year, the famous constellation is visible to the southeast just after sunset. From most Earthly locations, Orion's familiar star pattern, highlighted by the three-stars-in-a-row belt stars, rises sideways. An entire section of the night sky that includes Orion was photographed rising above Śnieżka, a mountain on the border between Poland and the Czech Republic.  The long duration exposure sequence brings up many faint features including the Orion and Flame Nebulas, both encompassed by the curving Barnard's Loop. The featured wide-angle camera composite also captured night sky icons including the blue Pleiades star cluster at the image top and the red Rosette Nebula to the left of Orion. Famous stars in the frame include Procyon, Betelgeuse, Rigel and Aldebaran.

NGC 1365: Majestic Island Universe,"Barred spiral galaxy NGC 1365 is truly a majestic island universe some 200,000 light-years across. Located a mere 60 million light-years away toward the faint but heated constellation Fornax, NGC 1365 is a dominant member of the well-studied Fornax Cluster of galaxies. This sharp color image shows the intense, reddish star forming regions near the ends of the galaxy's central bar and along its spiral arms. Seen in fine detail, obscuring dust lanes cut across the galaxy's bright core. At the core lies a supermassive black hole.

NGC 1893 and the Tadpoles of IC 410,"This cosmic view shows off an otherwise faint emission nebula IC 410, captured under clear Netherlands skies with telescope and narrowband filters. Above and right of center you can spot two remarkable inhabitants of the interstellar pond of gas and dust, known as the tadpoles of IC 410. Partly obscured by foreground dust, the nebula itself surrounds NGC 1893, a young galactic cluster of stars. Formed in the interstellar cloud a mere 4 million years ago, the intensely hot, bright cluster stars energize the glowing gas. Globules composed of denser cooler gas and dust, the tadpoles are around 10 light-years long and are likely sites of ongoing star formation. Sculpted by stellar winds and radiation their heads are outlined by bright ridges of ionized gas while their tails trail away from the cluster's central young stars.

Apollo 14: A View from Antares,"Apollo 14's Lunar Module Antares landed on the Moon on February 5, 1971. Toward the end of the stay astronaut Ed Mitchell snapped a series of photos of the lunar surface while looking out a window, assembled into this detailed mosaic by Apollo Lunar Surface Journal editor Eric Jones. The view looks across the Fra Mauro highlands to the northwest of the landing site after the Apollo 14 astronauts had completed their second and final walk on the Moon. Prominent in the foreground is their Modular Equipment Transporter, a two-wheeled, rickshaw-like device used to carry tools and samples. Near the horizon at top center is a 1.5 meter wide boulder dubbed Turtle rock. In the shallow crater below Turtle rock is the long white handle of a sampling instrument, thrown there javelin-style by Mitchell.

The Cone Nebula from Hubble,"Stars are forming in the gigantic dust pillar called the Cone Nebula. Cones, pillars, and majestic flowing shapes abound in stellar nurseries where natal clouds of gas and dust are buffeted by energetic winds from newborn stars. The Cone Nebula, a well-known example, lies within the bright galactic star-forming region NGC 2264. The Cone was captured in unprecedented detail in this close-up composite of several observations from the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. While the Cone Nebula, about 2,500 light-years away in Monoceros, is around 7 light-years long, the region pictured here surrounding the cone's blunted head is a mere 2.5 light-years across. In our neck of the galaxy that distance is just over half way from our Sun to its nearest stellar neighbors in the Alpha Centauri star system. The massive star NGC 2264 IRS, seen by Hubble's infrared camera in 1997, is the likely source of the wind sculpting the Cone Nebula and lies off the top of the image.

In the Core of the Carina Nebula,"What's happening in the core of the Carina Nebula?  Stars are forming, dying, and leaving an impressive tapestry of dark dusty filaments.  The entire Carina Nebula, cataloged as NGC 3372, spans over 300 light years and lies about 8,500 light-years away in the constellation of Carina. The nebula is composed predominantly of hydrogen gas, which emits the pervasive red and orange glows seen mostly in the center of this highly detailed featured image.  The blue glow around the edges is created primarily by a trace amount of glowing oxygen. Young and massive stars located in the nebula's center expel dust when they explode in supernovas.  Eta Carinae, the most energetic star in the nebula's center, was one of the brightest stars in the sky in the 1830s, but then faded dramatically.

NGC 1566: A Spiral Galaxy from Webb and Hubble,"What's different about this galaxy? Very little, which makes the Spanish Dancer galaxy, NGC 1566, one of the most typical and photogenic spirals on the sky. There is something different about this galaxy image, though, because it is a diagonal combination of two images: one by the Hubble Space Telescope on the upper left, and the other by the James Webb Space Telescope on the lower right.  The Hubble image was taken in ultraviolet light and highlights the locations of bright blue stars and dark dust along the galaxy's impressive spiral arms. In contrast, the Webb image was taken in infrared light and highlights where the same dust emits more light than it absorbed. In the rollover image, the other two sides of these images are revealed. Blinking between the two images shows which stars are particularly hot because they glow brighter in ultraviolet light, and the difference between seemingly empty space and infrared-glowing dust.

The Heart Shaped Antennae Galaxies,"Are these two galaxies really attracted to each other? Yes, gravitationally, and the result appears as an enormous iconic heart -- at least for now. Pictured is the pair of galaxies cataloged as NGC 4038 and NGC 4039,known as the Antennae Galaxies.  Because they are only 60 million light years away, close by intergalactic standards, the pair is one of the best studied interacting galaxies on the night sky. Their strong attraction began about a billion years ago when they passed unusually close to each other.  As the two galaxies interact, their stars rarely collide, but new stars are formed when their interstellar gases crash together.  Some new stars have already formed, for example, in the long antennae seen extending out from the sides of the dancing duo. By the time the galaxy merger is complete, likely over a billion years from now, billions of new stars may have formed.

Globular Star Cluster 47 Tuc,"Globular star cluster 47 Tucanae is a jewel of the southern sky. Also known as NGC 104, it roams the halo of our Milky Way Galaxy along with some 200 other globular star clusters. The second brightest globular cluster (after Omega Centauri) as seen from planet Earth, 47 Tuc lies about 13,000 light-years away. It can be spotted with the naked-eye close on the sky to the Small Magellanic Cloud in the constellation of the Toucan. The dense cluster is made up of hundreds of thousands of stars in a volume only about 120 light-years across. Red giant stars on the outskirts of the cluster are easy to pick out as yellowish stars in this sharp telescopic portrait.

When Roses Aren't Red,"Not all roses are red of course, but they can still be very pretty. Likewise, the beautiful Rosette Nebula and other star forming regions are often shown in astronomical images with a predominately red hue, in part because the dominant emission in the nebula is from hydrogen atoms. Hydrogen's strongest optical emission line, known as H-alpha, is in the red region of the spectrum. But the beauty of an emission nebula need not be appreciated in red light alone. Other atoms in the nebula are also excited by energetic starlight and produce narrow emission lines as well. In this close-up view of the Rosette Nebula, narrowband images are mapped into broadband colors to show emission from Sulfur atoms in red, Hydrogen in green, and Oxygen in blue. In fact, the scheme of mapping these narrow atomic emission lines (SHO) into the broader colors (RGB) is adopted in many Hubble images of emission nebulae.

The Shadow of Ingenuity's Damaged Rotor Blade,"On January 18, 2024, during its 72nd flight in the thin Martian atmosphere, autonomous Mars Helicopter Ingenuity rose to an altitude of 12 meters (40 feet) and hovered for 4.5 seconds above the Red Planet.  Ingenuity's 72nd landing was a rough one though. During descent it lost contact with the Perseverance rover about 1 meter above the Martian surface. Ingenuity was able to transmit this image after contact was re-established, showing the shadow of one of its rotor blades likely damaged during landing. And so, after wildly exceeding expectations during over 1,000 days of exploring Mars, the history-making Ingenuity has ended its flight operations. Nicknamed Ginny, Mars Helicopter Ingenuity became the first aircraft to achieve powered, controlled flight on another planet on April 19, 2021. Before launch, a small piece of material from the lower-left wing of the Wright Brothers Flyer 1, the first aircraft to achieve powered, controlled flight on planet Earth, was fixed to the underside of Ingenuity's solar panel.","shadow, ingenuity, damaged, rotor, blade, january, flight, thin, martian, autonomous, helicopter, rose, altitude, meter, foot, hovered, second, planet, landing, rough, descent, lost, contact, perseverance, rover, surface, able, transmit, image, re-established, showing, exceeding, expectation, exploring, history-making, ended, operation, nicknamed, ginny, became, first, aircraft, powered, controlled, april, launch, small, piece, material, lower-left, wing, wright, brother, flyer, earth, fixed, underside, solar, panel"
Rocket Plume Shadow Points to the Moon,"Why would the shadow of a rocket's launch plume point toward the Moon?  In early 2001 during a launch of the space shuttle Atlantis, the Sun, Earth, Moon, and rocket were all properly aligned for this photogenic coincidence.  First, for the space shuttle's plume to cast a long shadow, the time of day must be either near sunrise or sunset.  Only then will the shadow be its longest and extend all the way to the horizon.  Finally, during a Full Moon, the Sun and Moon are on opposite sides of the sky.  Just after sunset, for example, the Sun is slightly below the horizon, and, in the other direction, the Moon is slightly above the horizon.  Therefore, as Atlantis blasted off, just after sunset, its shadow projected away from the Sun toward the opposite horizon, where the Full Moon happened to be.

HFG1 & Abell 6: Planetary Nebulae,"Planetary nebulae like Heckathorn-Fesen-Gull 1 (HFG1) and Abell 6 in the constellation Cassiopeia are remnants from the last phase of a medium sized star like our Sun.  In spite of their shapes, planetary nebulae have nothing in common with actual planets.  Located in the bottom left part of the featured photo, HFG1 was created by the binary star system V664 Cas, which consists of a white dwarf star and a red giant star. Both stars orbit their center of mass over about half an Earth day.  Traveling with the entire nebula at a speed about 300 times faster than the fastest train on Earth, V664 Cas generates a bluish arc shaped shock wave. The wave interacts most strongly with the surrounding interstellar medium in the areas where the arc is brightest. After roughly 10,000 years, planetary nebulae become invisible due to a lack of ultraviolet light being emitted by the stars that create them.  Displaying beautiful shapes and structures, planetary nebulae are highly desired objects for astrophotographers.","hfg1, planetary, nebula, heckathorn-fesen-gull, constellation, cassiopeia, remnant, last, phase, medium, sized, star, spite, shape, nothing, common, actual, planet, located, bottom, left, part, featured, photo, created, binary, system, v664, consists, white, dwarf, giant, orbit, center, mass, half, earth, traveling, entire, speed, time, fastest, train, generates, bluish, shaped, shock, wave, interacts, surrounding, interstellar, area, brightest, year, become, invisible, lack, ultraviolet, light, emitted, create, displaying, beautiful, structure, desired, object, astrophotographers"
A January Wolf Moon,"Did you see the full moon last month? During every month, on average, a full moon occurs in the skies over planet Earth. This is because the Moon takes a month to complete another orbit around our home planet, goes through all of its phases, and once again has its entire Earth-facing half lit by reflected sunlight.  Many indigenous cultures give each full moon a name, and this past full moon's names include the Ice Moon, the Stay at Home Moon, and the Quiet Moon. Occurring in January on the modern western calendar, several cultures have also named the most recent full moon the Wolf Moon, in honor of the famous howling animal. Featured here above the Italian Alps mountains, this past Wolf Moon was captured in combined long and short exposure images.  The image is striking because, to some, the surrounding clouds appear as a wolf's mouth ready to swallow the Wolf Moon, while others see the Moon as a wolf's eye.","january, wolf, moon, full, last, month, average, occurs, planet, earth, take, complete, orbit, home, phase, entire, earth-facing, half, reflected, sunlight, many, indigenous, culture, give, name, include, stay, quiet, occurring, modern, western, calendar, several, named, recent, honor, famous, howling, animal, featured, italian, mountain, captured, combined, short, exposure, image, striking, surrounding, cloud, appear, mouth, ready, swallow, others"
Rosette Deep Field,"Can you find the Rosette Nebula? The large, red, and flowery-looking nebula on the upper left may seem the obvious choice, but that is actually just diffuse hydrogen emission surrounding the Cone and Fox Fur Nebulas. The famous Rosette Nebula is really located on the lower right and connected to the other nebulas by irregular filaments.  Because the featured image of Rosetta's field is so wide and deep, it seems to contain other flowers.  Designated NGC 2237, the center of the Rosette nebula is populated by the bright blue stars of open cluster NGC 2244, whose winds and energetic light are evacuating the nebula's center.  The Rosette Nebula is about 5,000 light years distant and, just by itself, spans about three times the diameter of a full moon.

NGC 253: Dusty Island Universe,"Shiny NGC 253 is one of the brightest spiral galaxies visible, and also one of the dustiest.  Some call it the Silver Coin Galaxy for its appearance in small telescopes, or just the Sculptor Galaxy for its location within the boundaries of the southern constellation Sculptor.  Discovered in 1783 by mathematician and astronomer Caroline Herschel, the dusty island universe lies a mere 10 million light-years away. About 70 thousand light-years across, NGC 253 is the largest member of the Sculptor Group of Galaxies, the nearest to our own Local Group of Galaxies.  In addition to its spiral dust lanes, tendrils of dust seem to be rising from its galactic disk laced with young star clusters and star forming regions in this colorful galaxy portrait. The high dust content accompanies frantic star formation, earning NGC 253 the designation of a starburst galaxy. NGC 253 is also known to be a strong source of high-energy x-rays and gamma rays, likely due to massive black holes near the galaxy's center.","dusty, island, universe, shiny, brightest, spiral, galaxy, visible, dustiest, call, silver, coin, appearance, small, telescope, sculptor, location, boundary, southern, constellation, discovered, mathematician, astronomer, caroline, herschel, light-year, largest, member, group, local, addition, dust, lane, tendril, seem, rising, galactic, disk, laced, young, star, cluster, forming, region, colorful, portrait, high, content, accompanies, frantic, formation, earning, designation, known, strong, source, high-energy, x-ray, gamma, likely, massive, black, hole, center"
Structure in the Tail of Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks,"Heading for its next perihelion passage on April 21, Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is growing brighter. The greenish coma of this periodic Halley-type comet has become relatively easy to observe in small telescopes. But the bluish ion tail now streaming from the active comet's coma and buffeted by the solar wind, is faint and difficult to follow. Still, in this image stacked exposures made on the night of February 11 reveal the fainter tail's detailed structures. The frame spans over two degrees across a background of faint stars and background galaxies toward the northern constellation Lacerta. Of course Comet 12P's April 21 perihelion passage will be only two weeks after the April 8 total solar eclipse, putting the comet in planet Earth's sky along with a totally eclipsed Sun.","structure, tail, comet, heading, next, perihelion, passage, april, 12p/pons-brooks, growing, brighter, greenish, coma, periodic, halley-type, become, easy, observe, small, telescope, bluish, streaming, active, buffeted, solar, wind, faint, difficult, follow, image, stacked, exposure, made, night, february, reveal, fainter, detailed, frame, span, degree, background, star, galaxy, northern, constellation, lacerta, course, week, total, eclipse, putting, planet, earth, eclipsed"
Meteor over the Bay of Naples,"A cosmic dust grain plowing through the upper atmosphere much faster than a falling leaf created this brilliant meteor streak. In a serendipitous moment, the sublime night sky view was captured from the resort island of Capri, in the Bay of Naples, on the evening of February 8. Looking across the bay, the camera faces northeast toward the lights of Naples and surrounding cities. Pointing toward the horizon, the meteor streak by chance ends above the silhouette of Mount Vesuvius. One of planet Earth's most famous volcanos, an eruption of Mount Vesuvius destroyed the city of Pompeii in 79 AD.","meteor, naples, cosmic, dust, grain, plowing, upper, much, falling, leaf, created, brilliant, streak, serendipitous, moment, sublime, night, view, captured, resort, island, capri, evening, february, looking, camera, face, light, surrounding, city, pointing, horizon, chance, silhouette, mount, vesuvius, planet, earth, famous, volcano, eruption, destroyed, pompeii"
Hoag's Object: A Nearly Perfect Ring Galaxy,"Is this one galaxy or two?  This question came to light in 1950 when astronomer Arthur Hoag chanced upon this unusual extragalactic object.  On the outside is a ring dominated by bright blue stars, while near the center lies a ball of much redder stars that are likely much older.  Between the two is a gap that appears almost completely dark.  How Hoag's Object formed, including its nearly perfectly round ring of stars and gas, remains unknown.  Genesis hypotheses include a galaxy collision billions of years ago and the gravitational effect of a central bar that has since vanished. The featured photo was taken by the Hubble Space Telescope and reprocessed using an artificially intelligent de-noising algorithm.  Observations in radio waves indicate that Hoag's Object has not accreted a smaller galaxy in the past billion years.  Hoag's Object spans about 100,000 light years and lies about 600 million light years away toward the constellation of the Snake (Serpens).  Many galaxies far in the distance are visible toward the right, while coincidentally, visible in the gap at about seven o'clock, is another but more distant ring galaxy.","hoag, object, perfect, ring, galaxy, question, came, light, astronomer, arthur, chanced, unusual, extragalactic, dominated, bright, blue, star, center, much, redder, older, appears, dark, formed, including, round, remains, unknown, genesis, hypothesis, include, collision, year, gravitational, effect, central, vanished, featured, photo, taken, hubble, space, telescope, reprocessed, using, intelligent, de-noising, algorithm, observation, radio, wave, indicate, accreted, smaller, span, constellation, snake, serpens, many, distance, visible, right, o'clock, distant"
Looking Sideways from the Parker Solar Probe,"What's happening near the Sun?  To help find out, NASA launched the robotic Parker Solar Probe (PSP) to investigate regions closer to the Sun than ever before. The PSP's looping orbit brings it nearer to the Sun each time around -- every few months. The featured time-lapse video shows the view looking sideways from behind PSP's Sun shield during its 16th approach to the Sun last year -- from well within the orbit of Mercury.  The PSP's Wide Field Imager for Solar Probe (WISPR) cameras took the images over eleven days, but they are digitally compressed here into about one minute video.  The waving of the solar corona is visible, as is a coronal mass ejection, with stars, planets, and even the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy streaming by in the background as the PSP orbits the Sun. PSP has found the solar neighborhood to be surprisingly complex and to include switchbacks -- times when the Sun's magnetic field briefly reverses itself.","looking, sideways, parker, solar, probe, happening, help, find, nasa, launched, robotic, investigate, region, looping, orbit, brings, nearer, time, month, featured, time-lapse, video, show, view, shield, approach, last, year, mercury, wide, field, imager, wispr, camera, took, image, compressed, minute, waving, corona, visible, coronal, mass, ejection, star, planet, central, band, milky, galaxy, streaming, background, found, neighborhood, complex, include, switchbacks, magnetic, briefly, revers"
AM1054: Stars Form as Galaxies Collide,"When galaxies collide, how many stars are born?  For AM1054-325, featured here in a recently released image by the Hubble Space Telescope, the answer is millions. Instead of stars being destroyed as galaxy AM1054-325 and a nearby galaxy circle each other, their gravity and motion has ignited stellar creation.  Star formation occurs rapidly in the gaseous debris stretching from AM1054-325’s yellowish body due to the other galaxy’s gravitational pull.  Hydrogen gas surrounding newborn stars glows pink.  Bright infant stars shine blue and cluster together in compact nurseries of thousands to millions of stars. AM1054-325 possesses over 100 of these intense-blue, dot-like star clusters, some appearing like a string of pearls.  Analyzing ultraviolet light helped determine that most of these stars are less than 10 million years old: stellar babies.  Many of these nurseries may grow up to be globular star clusters, while the bundle of young stars at the bottom tip may even detach and form a small galaxy.","am1054, star, form, galaxy, collide, many, born, am1054-325, featured, released, image, hubble, space, telescope, destroyed, nearby, circle, gravity, motion, ignited, stellar, creation, formation, occurs, gaseous, debris, stretching, yellowish, body, gravitational, pull, hydrogen, surrounding, newborn, glow, pink, bright, infant, shine, blue, cluster, compact, nursery, possesses, intense-blue, dot-like, appearing, string, pearl, analyzing, ultraviolet, light, helped, determine, less, year, baby, grow, globular, bundle, young, bottom, detach, small"
Seagull Nebula over Pinnacles' Peak,"The bird is bigger than the peak.  Nicknamed for its avian shape, the Seagull Nebula is an emission nebula on the night sky that is vast, spanning an angle over five times the diameter of the full moon and over 200 light years.  The head of the nebula is catalogued as IC 2177, and the star cluster under its right wing is catalogued as NGC 2343. Consisting of mostly red-glowing hydrogen gas, the Seagull Nebula incorporates some dust lanes and is forming stars.  The peak over which this Seagull seems to soar occurs at Pinnacles National Park in California, USA.

A View Toward M106,"Big, bright, beautiful spiral, Messier 106 dominates this cosmic vista. The nearly two degree wide telescopic field of view looks toward the well-trained constellation Canes Venatici, near the handle of the Big Dipper. Also known as NGC 4258, M106 is about 80,000 light-years across and 23.5 million light-years away, the largest member of the Canes II galaxy group. For a far far away galaxy, the distance to M106 is well-known in part because it can be directly measured by tracking this galaxy's remarkable maser, or microwave laser emission. Very rare but naturally occurring, the maser emission is produced by water molecules in molecular clouds orbiting its active galactic nucleus. Another prominent spiral galaxy on the scene, viewed nearly edge-on, is NGC 4217 below and right of M106. The distance to NGC 4217 is much less well-known, estimated to be about 60 million light-years, but the bright spiky stars are in the foreground, well inside our own Milky Way galaxy.","view, m106, bright, beautiful, spiral, messier, dominates, cosmic, vista, degree, wide, telescopic, field, look, well-trained, constellation, cane, venatici, handle, dipper, known, light-year, largest, member, galaxy, group, distance, well-known, part, measured, tracking, remarkable, maser, microwave, laser, emission, rare, occurring, produced, water, molecule, molecular, cloud, orbiting, active, galactic, nucleus, prominent, scene, viewed, edge-on, right, estimated, spiky, star, milky"
The Pencil Nebula Supernova Shock Wave,"This supernova shock wave plows through interstellar space at over 500,000 kilometers per hour. Centered and moving upward in the sharply detailed color composite its thin, bright, braided filaments are actually long ripples in a cosmic sheet of glowing gas seen almost edge-on. Discovered in the 1840s by Sir John Herschel, the narrow-looking nebula is sometimes known as Herschel's Ray. Cataloged as NGC 2736, its pointed appearance suggests its modern popular name, the Pencil Nebula. The Pencil Nebula is about 800 light-years away. Nearly 5 light-years long it represents only a small part of the Vela supernova remnant though. The enormous Vela remnant itself is around 100 light-years in diameter, the expanding debris cloud of a star that was seen to explode about 11,000 years ago. Initially, the section of the shock wave seen as the Pencil nebula was moving at millions of kilometers per hour but has slowed considerably, sweeping up surrounding interstellar material.","pencil, supernova, shock, wave, interstellar, space, kilometer, hour, centered, moving, detailed, color, composite, thin, bright, braided, filament, ripple, cosmic, sheet, glowing, seen, edge-on, discovered, john, herschel, narrow-looking, nebula, known, cataloged, pointed, appearance, suggests, modern, popular, name, light-year, long, represents, small, part, vela, remnant, enormous, diameter, expanding, debris, cloud, star, year, section, slowed, sweeping, surrounding, material"
Odysseus to the Moon,"Intuitive Machines' robotic lander Odysseus has accomplished the first U.S. landing on the Moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Launched on a SpaceX rocket on February 15, the phone booth sized lander reached lunar orbit on the 21st and touched down on the lunar surface at 6:23 pm ET on February 22nd. Its landing region is about 300 kilometers north of the Moon's south pole, near a crater designated Malapert A. Resting on its side, the lander is presently collecting solar power and transmitting data back to the Intuitive Machines' mission control center in Houston. The mission marks the first commercial uncrewed landing on the Moon. Prior to landing, Odysseus’ camera captured this extreme wide angle image (landing legs visible at right) as it flew over Schomberger crater some 200 kilometers from its landing site.

A Phoenix Aurora over Iceland,"All of the other aurora watchers had gone home. By 3:30 am in Iceland, on a quiet September night, much of that night's auroras had died down. Suddenly, unexpectedly, a new burst of particles streamed down from space, lighting up the Earth's atmosphere once again. This time, surprisingly, pareidoliacally, the night lit up with an  amazing shape reminiscent of a giant phoenix. With camera equipment at the ready, two quick sky images were taken, followed immediately by a third of the land.  The mountain in the background is Helgafell, while the small foreground river is called Kaldá, both located about 30 kilometers north of Iceland's capital Reykjavík. Seasoned skywatchers will note that just above the mountain, toward the left, is the constellation of Orion, while the Pleiades star cluster is also visible just above the frame center.  The 2016 aurora, which lasted only a minute and was soon gone forever --  would possibly be dismissed as a fanciful fable -- were it not captured in the featured, digitally-composed, image mosaic.

Martian Moon Eclipses Martian Moon,"What if there were two moons in the sky -- and they eclipsed each other? This happens on Mars. The featured video shows a version of this unusual eclipse from space. Pictured are the two moons of Mars: the larger Phobos, which orbits closer to the red planet, and the smaller Deimos, which orbits further out. The sequence was captured last year by the ESA’s Mars Express, a robotic spacecraft that itself orbits Mars. A similar eclipse is visible from the Martian surface, although very rarely.  From the surface, though, the closer moon Phobos would appear to pass in front of farther moon Deimos. Most oddly, Phobos orbits Mars so close that it appears to move backwards when compared to Earth's Moon from Earth, rising in west and setting in the east. Phobos, the closer moon, orbits so close and so fast that it passes nearly overhead about three times a day.","martian, moon, eclipse, eclipsed, happens, featured, video, show, version, unusual, space, pictured, larger, phobos, orbit, planet, smaller, deimos, sequence, captured, last, year, robotic, spacecraft, similar, visible, surface, closer, appear, front, close, appears, move, backwards, compared, earth, rising, west, setting, east, fast, pass, overhead, time"
Supernova Remnant Simeis 147,"It's easy to get lost following the intricate, looping, and twisting filaments of supernova remnant Simeis 147.  Also cataloged as Sharpless 2-240, the filamentary nebula goes by the popular nickname the Spaghetti Nebula.  Seen toward the boundary of the constellations of the Bull (Taurus) and the Charioteer (Auriga), the impressive gas structure covers nearly 3 degrees on the sky, equivalent to 6 full moons. That's about 150 light-years at the stellar debris cloud's estimated distance of 3,000 light-years.  This composite image includes data taken through narrow-band filters isolating emission from hydrogen (red) and oxygen (blue) glowing gas. The supernova remnant has an estimated age of about 40,000 years, meaning light from this massive stellar explosion first reached the Earth when woolly mammoths roamed free.  Besides the expanding remnant, this cosmic catastrophe left behind a pulsar, a spinning neutron star that is the remnant of the original star's core.","supernova, remnant, simeis, easy, lost, following, intricate, looping, twisting, filament, cataloged, sharpless, 2-240, filamentary, nebula, popular, nickname, spaghetti, seen, boundary, constellation, bull, taurus, charioteer, impressive, structure, cover, degree, equivalent, full, moon, light-year, stellar, debris, cloud, estimated, distance, composite, image, includes, data, taken, narrow-band, filter, isolating, emission, hydrogen, oxygen, blue, glowing, year, meaning, light, massive, explosion, reached, earth, roamed, free, expanding, cosmic, catastrophe, left, pulsar, spinning, neutron, star, original, core"
Shades of Night,"How does the sky turn dark at night? In stages, and with different characteristic colors rising from the horizon. The featured image shows, left to right, increasingly late twilight times after sunset in 20 different vertical bands. The picture was taken last month in Syracuse, Sicily, Italy, in the direction opposite the Sun. On the far left is the pre-sunset upper sky.  Toward the right, prominent bands include the Belt of Venus, the Blue Band, the Horizon Band, and the Red Band. As the dark shadow of the Earth rises, the colors in these bands are caused by direct sunlight reflecting from air and aerosols in the Earth's atmosphere, multiple reflections sometimes involving a reddened sunset, and refraction. In practice, these bands can be diffuse and hard to discern, and their colors can depend on colors near the setting Sun. Finally, the Sun completely sets and the sky becomes dark. Don't despair -- the whole thing will happen in reverse when the Sun rises again in the morning.","shade, night, turn, dark, stage, different, characteristic, color, rising, horizon, featured, image, show, left, right, twilight, time, sunset, vertical, band, picture, taken, last, month, syracuse, italy, direction, opposite, pre-sunset, upper, prominent, include, belt, blue, shadow, earth, rise, caused, direct, sunlight, reflecting, aerosol, atmosphere, multiple, reflection, involving, reddened, refraction, practice, hard, discern, depend, setting, becomes, despair, whole, thing, happen, reverse, morning"
Julius Caesar and Leap Days,"In 46 BC Julius Caesar reformed the calendar system. Based on advice by astronomer Sosigenes of Alexandria, the Julian calendar included one leap day every four years to account for the fact that an Earth year is slightly more than 365 days long. In modern terms, the time it takes for the planet to orbit the Sun once is 365.24219 mean solar days. So if calendar years contained exactly 365 days they would drift from the Earth's year by about 1 day every 4 years and eventually July (named for Julius Caesar himself) would occur during the northern hemisphere winter. By adopting a leap year with an extra day every four years, the Julian calendar year would drift much less. In 1582 Pope Gregory XIII provided the further fine-tuning that leap days should not occur in years ending in 00, unless divisible by 400. This Gregorian Calendar system is the one in wide use today. Of course, tidal friction in the Earth-Moon system slows Earth's rotation and gradually lengthens the day by about 1.4 milliseconds per century. That means that leap days like today will not be necessary, about 4 million years from now. This Roman silver coin, a denarius, depicts Julius Caesar (left) and Venus, Roman goddess of love.","julius, caesar, leap, reformed, calendar, system, based, astronomer, sosigenes, alexandria, julian, included, year, account, fact, long, modern, term, time, take, planet, orbit, mean, solar, contained, drift, earth, named, occur, winter, adopting, extra, less, pope, gregory, xiii, provided, fine-tuning, ending, divisible, gregorian, wide, today, course, tidal, friction, earth-moon, slows, rotation, lengthens, millisecond, century, necessary, roman, silver, coin, denarius, depicts, left, venus, goddess, love"
Odysseus and The Dish,"Murriyang, the CSIRO’s Parkes Radio Telescope, points toward a nearly Full Moon in this image from New South Wales, Australia, planet Earth. Bathed in moonlight, the 64 meter dish is receiving weak radio signals from Odysseus, following the robotic lander's February 22 touch down some 300 kilometers north of the Moon's south pole. The landing of Odysseus represents the first U.S. landing on the Moon since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. Odysseus' tilted orientation on the lunar surface prevents its high-gain antenna from pointing toward Earth. But the sensitivity of the large, steerable Parkes dish significantly improved the reception of data from the experiments delivered to the lunar surface by the robotic moon lander. Of course the Parkes Radio Telescope dish became famous for its superior lunar television reception during the Apollo 11 mission in 1969, allowing denizens of planet Earth to watch the first moonwalk.","odysseus, dish, murriyang, csiro, parkes, radio, telescope, point, full, moon, image, south, wale, australia, planet, earth, bathed, meter, receiving, weak, signal, following, robotic, lander, february, touch, kilometer, north, pole, landing, represents, first, u.s., apollo, mission, tilted, orientation, lunar, surface, prevents, high-gain, pointing, sensitivity, large, steerable, improved, reception, data, experiment, delivered, course, became, famous, superior, television, allowing, denizen, watch, moonwalk"

A Total Solar Eclipse Close-Up in Real Time,"How would you feel if the Sun disappeared? Many eclipse watchers across the USA surprised themselves in 2017 with the awe that they felt and the exclamations that they made as the Sun momentarily disappeared behind the Moon. Perhaps expecting just a brief moment of dusk, the spectacle of unusually rapid darkness, breathtakingly bright glowing beads around the Moon's edge, shockingly pink solar prominences, and a strangely detailed corona stretching across the sky caught many a curmudgeon by surprise.  Many of these attributes  were captured in the featured real-time, three-minute video of 2017's total solar eclipse. The video frames were acquired in  Warm Springs, Oregon with equipment specifically designed by Jun Ho Oh to track a close-up of the Sun's periphery during eclipse.  As the video ends, the Sun is seen being reborn on the other side of the Moon from where it departed.  Next month, on April 8th, a new total solar eclipse will be visible in a thin band across North America.","total, solar, eclipse, close-up, real, time, feel, disappeared, many, surprised, felt, exclamation, made, moon, expecting, brief, moment, dusk, spectacle, rapid, darkness, bright, glowing, bead, edge, pink, prominence, detailed, corona, stretching, caught, curmudgeon, surprise, attribute, captured, featured, real-time, three-minute, video, frame, acquired, warm, spring, oregon, equipment, designed, track, periphery, seen, reborn, side, departed, next, month, april, visible, thin, band, north, america"
Light Pillars Over Inner Mongolia,"What's happening across that field?  Pictured here are not auroras but nearby light pillars, a phenomenon typically much closer.   In most places on Earth, a lucky viewer can see a Sun pillar, a column of light appearing to extend up from the Sun caused by flat fluttering ice-crystals reflecting sunlight from the upper atmosphere.  Usually, these ice crystals evaporate before reaching the ground.  During freezing temperatures, however, flat fluttering ice crystals may form near the ground in a form of light snow  sometimes known as a crystal fog.  These ice crystals may then reflect ground lights in columns not unlike a Sun pillar.  The featured image was taken last month across the Wulan Butong Grasslands in Inner Mongolia, China.","light, pillar, inner, mongolia, happening, field, pictured, aurora, phenomenon, place, earth, lucky, viewer, column, appearing, extend, caused, flat, fluttering, ice-crystals, reflecting, sunlight, upper, atmosphere, crystal, evaporate, reaching, ground, freezing, temperature, form, snow, known, reflect, featured, image, taken, last, month, wulan, grassland, china"
NGC 2170: Angel Nebula Abstract Art,"Is this a painting or a photograph? In this celestial abstract art composed with a cosmic brush, dusty nebula NGC 2170, also known as the Angel Nebula, shines just above the image center. Reflecting the light of nearby hot stars, NGC 2170 is joined by other bluish reflection nebulae, a red emission region, many dark absorption nebulae, and a backdrop of colorful stars. Like the common household items that abstract painters often choose for their subjects, the clouds of gas, dust, and hot stars featured here are also commonly found in a setting like this one --  a massive, star-forming molecular cloud in the constellation of the Unicorn (Monoceros). The giant molecular cloud, Mon R2, is impressively close, estimated to be only 2,400 light-years or so away. At that distance, this canvas would be over 60 light-years across.","angel, abstract, painting, photograph, celestial, composed, cosmic, brush, dusty, nebula, known, shine, image, center, reflecting, light, star, joined, bluish, reflection, emission, region, many, dark, absorption, backdrop, colorful, common, household, item, painter, choose, subject, cloud, dust, featured, found, setting, massive, star-forming, molecular, constellation, unicorn, monoceros, giant, estimated, light-year, distance, canvas"
M102: Edge-on Disk Galaxy,"What kind of celestial object is this? A relatively normal galaxy -- but seen from its edge.  Many disk galaxies are actually just as thin as NGC 5866, the Spindle galaxy, pictured here, but are not seen edge-on from our vantage point.  A perhaps more familiar galaxy seen edge-on is our own Milky Way galaxy.  Also cataloged as M102, the Spindle galaxy has numerous and complex dust lanes appearing dark and red, while many of the bright stars in the disk give it a more blue underlying hue.  The blue disk of young stars can be seen in this Hubble image extending past the dust in the extremely thin galactic plane. There is evidence that the Spindle galaxy has cannibalized smaller galaxies over the past billion years or so, including multiple streams of faint stars, dark dust that extends away from the main galactic plane, and a surrounding group of galaxies (not shown).  In general, many disk galaxies become thin because the gas that forms them collides with itself as it rotates about the gravitational center. The Spindle galaxy lies about 50 million light years distant toward the constellation of the Dragon (Draco).","m102, edge-on, disk, galaxy, kind, celestial, object, normal, seen, edge, many, thin, spindle, pictured, vantage, point, familiar, milky, cataloged, numerous, complex, dust, lane, appearing, dark, bright, star, give, blue, underlying, young, hubble, image, extending, past, galactic, plane, evidence, cannibalized, smaller, year, including, multiple, stream, faint, extends, main, surrounding, group, shown, general, become, form, collides, rotates, gravitational, center, light, distant, constellation, dragon, draco"
The Crew-8 Nebula,"Not the James Webb Space Telescope's latest view of a distant galactic nebula, this cloud of gas and dust dazzled spacecoast skygazers on March 3. The telephoto snapshot was taken minutes after the launch of a Falcon 9 rocket on the SpaceX Crew-8 mission to the International Space Station. It captures plumes and exhaust from the separated first and second stages, a drifting Rorschach pattern in dark evening skies.  The bright spot near bottom center within the stunning terrestrial nebulosity is the second stage engine firing to carry 4 humans to space in the Crew Dragon spacecraft Endeavour. In sharp silhouette just above it is the Falcon 9 first stage booster orienting itself for return to a landing zone at Cape Canaveral, planet Earth. This reuseable first stage booster was making its first flight. But the Crew Dragon Endeavour capsule has flown humans to low Earth orbit and back again 4 times before. Endeavour, as a name for a spacecraft, has also seen reuse, christening retired Space Shuttle Endeavour and the Apollo 15 command module.","crew-8, nebula, james, webb, space, telescope, latest, view, distant, galactic, cloud, dust, dazzled, spacecoast, skygazers, march, telephoto, snapshot, taken, minute, launch, falcon, rocket, spacex, mission, international, station, capture, plume, exhaust, separated, first, second, stage, drifting, rorschach, pattern, dark, evening, bright, spot, bottom, center, stunning, terrestrial, nebulosity, engine, firing, carry, human, crew, dragon, spacecraft, endeavour, sharp, silhouette, booster, orienting, return, landing, cape, canaveral, planet, earth, reuseable, making, flight, capsule, flown, orbit, time, name, seen, reuse, christening, retired, shuttle, apollo, command, module"
The Tarantula Zone,"The Tarantula Nebula, also known as 30 Doradus, is more than a thousand light-years in diameter, a giant star forming region within nearby satellite galaxy the Large Magellanic Cloud. About 180 thousand light-years away, it's the largest, most violent star forming region known in the whole Local Group of galaxies. The cosmic arachnid sprawls across this magnificent view, an assembly of image data from large space- and ground-based telescopes. Within the Tarantula (NGC 2070), intense radiation, stellar winds, and supernova shocks from the central young cluster of massive stars cataloged as R136 energize the nebular glow and shape the spidery filaments. Around the Tarantula are other star forming regions with young star clusters, filaments, and blown-out bubble-shaped clouds. In fact, the frame includes the site of the closest supernova in modern times, SN 1987A, at lower right. The rich field of view spans about 2 degrees or 4 full moons in the southern constellation Dorado. But were the Tarantula Nebula closer, say 1,500 light-years distant like the Milky Way's own star forming Orion Nebula, it would take up half the sky.","tarantula, nebula, known, doradus, light-year, diameter, giant, star, forming, region, nearby, satellite, galaxy, large, magellanic, cloud, largest, violent, whole, local, group, cosmic, arachnid, sprawl, magnificent, view, image, data, space-, ground-based, telescope, intense, radiation, stellar, wind, supernova, shock, central, young, cluster, massive, cataloged, r136, energize, nebular, glow, shape, spidery, filament, blown-out, bubble-shaped, fact, frame, includes, site, closest, modern, time, lower, right, rich, field, span, degree, full, moon, southern, constellation, dorado, closer, distant, milky, orion, take, half"
Comet Pons-Brooks in Northern Spring,"As spring approaches for northern skygazers, Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks is growing brighter. Currently visible with small telescopes and binoculars, the Halley-type comet could reach naked eye visibility in the coming weeks. Seen despite a foggy atmosphere, the comet's green coma and long tail hover near the horizon in this well-composed deep night skyscape from Revuca, Slovakia recorded on March 5. M31, also known as the Andromeda galaxy, and bright yellowish star Mirach, beta star of the constellation Andromeda, hang in the sky above the comet. The Andromeda galaxy is some 2.5 million light-years beyond the Milky Way. Comet Pons-Brooks is a periodic visitor to the inner Solar System and less than 14 light-minutes away. Reaching its perihelion on April 21, this comet should be visible in the sky during the April 8 total solar eclipse.","comet, pons-brooks, northern, spring, approach, skygazers, 12p/pons-brooks, growing, brighter, visible, small, telescope, binoculars, halley-type, reach, naked, visibility, coming, week, seen, foggy, green, coma, tail, hover, horizon, well-composed, deep, night, skyscape, revuca, slovakia, recorded, march, known, andromeda, galaxy, bright, yellowish, star, mirach, beta, constellation, hang, light-year, milky, periodic, visitor, inner, solar, system, light-minutes, reaching, perihelion, april, total, eclipse"
A Total Eclipse at the End of the World,"Would you go to the end of the world to see a total eclipse of the Sun? If you did, would you be surprised to find someone else there already? In 2003, the Sun, the Moon, Antarctica, and two photographers all lined up in Antarctica during an unusual total solar eclipse.  Even given the extreme location, a group of enthusiastic eclipse chasers ventured near the bottom of the world to experience the surreal momentary disappearance of the Sun behind the Moon.  One of the treasures collected was the featured picture -- a composite of four separate images digitally combined to realistically simulate how the adaptive human eye saw the eclipse.  As the image was taken, both the Moon and the Sun peeked together over an Antarctic ridge.  In the sudden darkness, the magnificent corona of the Sun became visible around the Moon.  Quite by accident, another photographer was caught in one of the images checking his video camera.   Visible to his left are an equipment bag and a collapsible chair.  A more easily visible solar eclipse will occur in just under four weeks and be visible from a long, thin swath of North America.","total, eclipse, world, surprised, find, someone, moon, antarctica, photographer, lined, unusual, solar, given, extreme, location, group, enthusiastic, chaser, ventured, bottom, experience, surreal, momentary, disappearance, treasure, collected, featured, picture, composite, separate, image, combined, simulate, adaptive, human, taken, peeked, antarctic, ridge, sudden, darkness, magnificent, corona, became, visible, accident, caught, checking, video, camera, left, equipment, collapsible, chair, occur, week, thin, swath, north, america"
A Full Plankton Moon,"What glows in the night? This night featured a combination of usual and unusual glows. Perhaps the most usual glow was from the Moon, a potentially familiar object. The full Moon's nearly vertical descent results from the observer being near Earth's equator. As the Moon sets, air and aerosols in Earth's atmosphere preferentially scatter out blue light, making the Sun-reflecting satellite appear reddish when near the horizon.                                                                        Perhaps the most unusual glow was from the bioluminescent plankton, likely less familiar objects. These microscopic creatures glow blue, it is thought, primarily to surprise and deter predators. In this case, the glow was caused primarily by plankton-containing waves crashing onto the beach. The image was taken on Soneva Fushi Island, Maldives just over one year ago.

A Galaxy-Shaped Rocket Exhaust Spiral,"What's that over the horizon? What may look like a strangely nearby galaxy is actually a normal rocket's exhaust plume -- but unusually backlit.  Although the SpaceX Falcon 9 rocket was launched from Vandenberg Space Force Base in California, USA, its burned propellant was visible over a much wider area, with the featured photograph being taken from Akureyri, Iceland. The huge spaceship was lifted off a week ago, and the resulting spectacle was captured soon afterward with a single 10-second smartphone exposure, before it quickly dissipated. Like noctilucent clouds, the plume's brightness is caused by the Twilight Effect, where an object is high enough to be illuminated by the twilight Sun, even when the observer on the ground experiences the darkness of night. The spiral shape is caused by the Falcon  rocket reorienting to release satellites in different directions. Stars and faint green and red aurora appear in the background of this extraordinary image.","galaxy-shaped, rocket, exhaust, spiral, horizon, look, nearby, galaxy, normal, plume, backlit, spacex, falcon, launched, vandenberg, space, force, base, california, burned, propellant, visible, much, wider, area, featured, photograph, taken, akureyri, iceland, huge, spaceship, lifted, week, resulting, spectacle, captured, single, 10-second, smartphone, exposure, dissipated, noctilucent, cloud, brightness, caused, twilight, effect, object, high, illuminated, ground, experience, darkness, night, shape, reorienting, release, satellite, different, direction, star, faint, green, aurora, appear, extraordinary, image"
The Seagull Nebula,"A broad expanse of glowing gas and dust presents a bird-like visage to astronomers from planet Earth, suggesting its popular moniker: the Seagull Nebula. This portrait of the cosmic bird covers a 2.5-degree wide swath across the plane of the Milky Way, near the direction of Sirius, alpha star of the constellation of the Big Dog (Canis Major). Of course, the region includes objects with other catalog designations: notably NGC 2327, a compact, dusty emission and reflection nebula with an embedded massive star that forms the bird's head. Likely part of a larger shell structure swept up by successive supernova explosions, the broad Seagull Nebula is cataloged as Sh2-296 and IC 2177. The prominent bluish arc below and right of center is a bow shock from runaway star FN Canis Majoris. Dominated by the reddish glow of atomic hydrogen, this complex of gas and dust clouds with other stars of the Canis Majoris OB1 association spans over 200 light-years at the Seagull Nebula's estimated 3,800 light-year distance.

Moon Pi and Mountain Shadow,"What phase of the Moon is 3.14 radians from the Sun? The Full Moon, of course. Even though the Moon might look full for several days, the Moon is truly at its full phase when it is Pi radians (aka 180 degrees) from the Sun in ecliptic longitude. That's opposite the Sun in planet Earth's sky. Rising as the Sun set on March 9, 2020, only an hour or so after the moment of its full phase, this orange tinted and slightly flattened Moon still looked full. It was photographed opposite the setting Sun from Teide National Park on the Canary Island of Tenerife. Also opposite the setting Sun, seen from near the Teide volcano peak about 3,500 meters above sea level, is the mountain's rising triangular shadow extending into Earth's dense atmosphere. Below the distant ridge line on the left are the white telescope domes of Teide Observatory. Again Pi radians from the Sun, on March 25 the Full Moon will dim slightly as it glides through Earth's outer shadow in a penumbral lunar eclipse.","moon, mountain, shadow, phase, radian, full, course, look, several, degree, ecliptic, longitude, opposite, planet, earth, rising, march, hour, moment, orange, tinted, flattened, looked, photographed, setting, teide, national, park, canary, island, tenerife, seen, volcano, peak, meter, level, triangular, extending, dense, distant, ridge, line, left, white, telescope, dome, observatory, glide, outer, penumbral, lunar, eclipse"
Portrait of NGC 1055,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy NGC 1055 is a dominant member of a small galaxy group a mere 60 million light-years away toward the aquatically intimidating constellation Cetus. Seen edge-on, the island universe spans over 100,000 light-years, a little larger than our own Milky Way galaxy. The colorful, spiky stars decorating this cosmic portrait of NGC 1055 are in the foreground, well within the Milky Way. But the telltale pinkish star forming regions are scattered through winding dust lanes along the distant galaxy's thin disk. With a smattering of even more distant background galaxies, the deep image also reveals a boxy halo that extends far above and below the central bulge and disk of NGC 1055. The halo itself is laced with faint, narrow structures, and could represent the mixed and spread out debris from a satellite galaxy disrupted by the larger spiral some 10 billion years ago.","portrait, beautiful, spiral, galaxy, dominant, member, small, group, mere, light-year, intimidating, constellation, cetus, seen, edge-on, island, universe, span, little, larger, milky, colorful, spiky, star, decorating, cosmic, foreground, telltale, pinkish, forming, region, scattered, winding, dust, lane, distant, thin, disk, smattering, background, deep, image, reveals, boxy, halo, extends, central, bulge, laced, faint, narrow, structure, represent, mixed, spread, satellite, disrupted, year"
ELT and the Milky Way,"The southern winter Milky Way sprawls across this night skyscape. Looking due south, the webcam view was recorded near local midnight on March 11 in dry, dark skies over the central Chilean Atacama desert. Seen below the graceful arc of diffuse starlight are satellite galaxies of the mighty Milky Way, also known as the Large and Small Magellanic clouds. In the foreground is the site of the European Southern Observatory's 40-metre-class Extremely Large Telescope (ELT).

NGC 7714: Starburst after Galaxy Collision,"Is this galaxy jumping through a giant ring of stars?  Probably not.  Although the precise dynamics behind the featured image is yet unclear, what is clear is that the pictured galaxy, NGC 7714, has been stretched and distorted by a recent collision with a neighboring galaxy. This smaller neighbor, NGC 7715, situated off to the left of the frame, is thought to have charged right through NGC 7714. Observations indicate that the golden ring pictured is composed of millions of older Sun-like stars that are likely co-moving with the interior bluer stars. In contrast, the bright center of NGC 7714 appears to be undergoing a burst of new star formation.  The featured image was captured by the Hubble Space Telescope.  NGC 7714 is located about 130 million light years away toward the constellation of the Two Fish (Pisces).  The interactions between these galaxies likely started about 150 million years ago and should continue for several hundred million years more, after which a single central galaxy may result.","starburst, galaxy, collision, jumping, giant, ring, star, precise, dynamic, featured, image, unclear, clear, pictured, stretched, distorted, recent, neighboring, smaller, neighbor, situated, left, frame, thought, charged, observation, indicate, golden, composed, older, sun-like, likely, co-moving, interior, bluer, contrast, bright, center, appears, undergoing, burst, formation, captured, hubble, space, telescope, located, light, year, constellation, fish, pisces, interaction, started, continue, several, single, central, result"
Comet Pons-Brooks' Swirling Coma,"A bright comet will be visible during next month's total solar eclipse.  This very unusual coincidence occurs because Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks's return to the inner Solar System places it by chance only 25 degrees away from the Sun during Earth's April 8 total solar eclipse.  Currently the comet is just on the edge of visibility to the unaided eye, best visible with binoculars in the early evening sky toward the constellation of the Fish (Pisces). Comet Pons-Brooks, though, is putting on quite a show for deep camera images even now.  The featured image is a composite of three very specific colors, showing the comet's ever-changing ion tail in light blue, its outer coma in green, and highlights some red-glowing gas around the coma in a spiral. The spiral is thought to be caused by gas being expelled by the slowly rotating nucleus of the giant iceberg comet. Although it is always difficult to predict the future brightness of comets, Comet Pons-Brook has been particularly prone to outbursts, making it even more difficult to predict how bright it will actually be as the Moon moves in front of the Sun on April 8.

A Picturesque Equinox Sunset,"What's that at the end of the road? The Sun. Many towns have roads that run east-west, and on two days each year, the Sun rises and sets right down the middle. Today, in some parts of the world (tomorrow in others), is one of those days: an equinox.  Not only is this a day of equal night (""aequus""-""nox"") and day time, but also a day when the sun rises precisely to the east and sets due west. Displayed here is a picturesque rural road in Alberta, Canada that runs approximately east-west. The featured image was taken during the September Equinox of 2021, but the geometry remains the same every year.  In many cultures, this March equinox is taken to be the first day of a season, typically spring in Earth's northern hemisphere, and autumn in the south. Does your favorite street run east-west?

The Eyes in Markarian's Galaxy Chain,"Across the heart of the Virgo Galaxy Cluster lies a string of galaxies known as Markarian's Chain. Prominent in Markarian's Chain are these two interacting galaxies, NGC 4438 (left) and NGC 4435 - also known as The Eyes. About 50 million light-years away, the two galaxies appear to be about 100,000 light-years apart in this sharp close-up, but have likely approached to within an estimated 16,000 light-years of each other in their cosmic past. Gravitational tides from the close encounter have ripped away at their stars, gas, and dust. The more massive NGC 4438 managed to hold on to much of the material torn out in the collision, while material from the smaller NGC 4435 was more easily lost. The remarkably deep image of this crowded region of the universe also includes many more distant background galaxies.","markarian, galaxy, chain, heart, virgo, cluster, string, known, prominent, interacting, left, light-year, appear, sharp, close-up, likely, approached, estimated, cosmic, gravitational, tide, ripped, star, dust, managed, much, material, torn, collision, smaller, lost, deep, image, crowded, region, universe, includes, many, distant, background"
The Leo Trio,"This popular group leaps into the early evening sky around the March equinox and the northern hemisphere spring.  Famous as the Leo Triplet, the three magnificent galaxies found in the prominent constellation Leo gather here in one astronomical field of view. Crowd pleasers when imaged with even modest telescopes, they can be introduced individually as NGC 3628 (left), M66 (bottom right), and M65 (top). All three are large spiral galaxies but tend to look dissimilar, because their galactic disks are tilted at different angles to our line of sight. NGC 3628, also known as the Hamburger Galaxy, is temptingly seen edge-on, with obscuring dust lanes cutting across its puffy galactic plane. The disks of M66 and M65 are both inclined enough to show off their spiral structure.  Gravitational interactions between galaxies in the group have left telltale signs, including the tidal tails and warped, inflated disk of NGC 3628 and the drawn out spiral arms of M66. This gorgeous view of the region spans over 1 degree (two full moons) on the sky in a frame that covers over half a million light-years at the trio's estimated distance of 30 million light-years.","trio, popular, group, leap, evening, march, equinox, northern, spring, famous, triplet, magnificent, galaxy, found, prominent, constellation, astronomical, field, view, crowd, pleaser, imaged, modest, telescope, introduced, left, bottom, right, large, spiral, tend, look, dissimilar, galactic, disk, tilted, different, angle, line, sight, known, hamburger, seen, edge-on, obscuring, dust, lane, cutting, puffy, plane, inclined, enough, show, structure, gravitational, interaction, telltale, sign, including, tidal, tail, warped, inflated, drawn, gorgeous, region, span, degree, full, moon, frame, cover, light-year, estimated, distance"
Phobos: Moon over Mars,"A tiny moon with a scary name, Phobos emerges from behind the Red Planet in this timelapse sequence from the Earth-orbiting Hubble Space Telescope. Over 22 minutes the 13 separate exposures were captured near the 2016 closest approach of Mars to planet Earth. Martians have to look to the west to watch Phobos rise, though. The small moon is closer to its parent planet than any other moon in the Solar System, about 3,700 miles (6,000 kilometers) above the Martian surface. It completes one orbit in just 7 hours and 39 minutes. That's faster than a Mars rotation, which corresponds to about 24 hours and 40 minutes. As a result, seen from the surface of Mars speeding Phobos rises above the western horizon 2 times in a Martian day. Still, Phobos is doomed.","phobos, moon, tiny, scary, name, emerges, planet, timelapse, sequence, earth-orbiting, hubble, space, telescope, minute, separate, exposure, captured, closest, approach, earth, martian, look, west, watch, rise, small, parent, solar, system, mile, kilometer, surface, completes, orbit, hour, faster, rotation, corresponds, result, seen, speeding, western, horizon, time, doomed"
Ares 3 Landing Site: The Martian Revisited,"This close-up from the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter's HiRISE camera shows weathered craters and windblown deposits in southern Acidalia Planitia. A striking shade of blue in standard HiRISE image colors, to the human eye the area would probably look grey or a little reddish. But human eyes have not gazed across this terrain, unless you count the eyes of NASA astronauts in the sci-fi novel, ""The Martian"", by Andy Weir. The novel chronicles the adventures of Mark Watney, an astronaut stranded at the fictional Mars mission Ares 3 landing site, corresponding to the coordinates of this cropped HiRISE frame. For scale, Watney's 6-meter-diameter habitat at the site would be about 1/10th the diameter of the large crater. Of course, the Ares 3 landing coordinates are only about 800 kilometers north of the (real life) Carl Sagan Memorial Station, the 1997 Pathfinder landing site.","landing, site, martian, revisited, close-up, reconnaissance, orbiter, hirise, camera, show, weathered, crater, windblown, deposit, southern, acidalia, planitia, striking, shade, blue, standard, image, color, human, area, look, grey, little, reddish, gazed, terrain, count, nasa, astronaut, sci-fi, novel, andy, chronicle, adventure, mark, watney, stranded, fictional, mission, corresponding, coordinate, cropped, frame, scale, 6-meter-diameter, habitat, diameter, large, course, kilometer, north, real, life, carl, sagan, memorial, station, pathfinder"
Looking Back at an Eclipsed Earth,Here is what the Earth looks like during a solar eclipse. The shadow of the Moon can be seen darkening part of Earth. This shadow moved across the Earth at nearly 2000 kilometers per hour. Only observers near the center of the dark circle see a total solar eclipse - others see a partial eclipse where only part of the Sun appears blocked by the Moon. This spectacular picture of the 1999 August 11 solar eclipse was one of the last ever taken from the Mir space station. The two bright spots that appear on the upper left are thought to be Jupiter and Saturn. Mir was deorbited in a controlled re-entry in 2001.

Sonified: The Jellyfish Nebula Supernova Remnant,"What does a supernova remnant sound like? Although sound is a compression wave in matter and does not carry into empty space, interpretive sound can help listeners appreciate and understand a visual image of a supernova remnant in a new way. Recently, the Jellyfish Nebula (IC 443) has been sonified quite creatively.  In the featured sound-enhanced video, when an imaginary line passes over a star, the sound of a drop falling into water is played, a sound particularly relevant to the nebula's aquatic namesake.  Additionally, when the descending line crosses gas that glows red, a low tone is played, while green sounds a middle tone, and blue produces a tone with a relatively high pitch.

Comet Pons-Brooks' Ion Tail,"Comet Pons-Brooks has quite a tail to tell.  First discovered in 1385, this erupting dirty snowball loops back into our inner Solar System every 71 years and, this time, is starting to put on a show for deep camera exposures.  In the featured picture, the light blue stream is the ion tail which consists of charged molecules pushed away from the comet's nucleus by the solar wind.  The ion tail, shaped by the Sun's wind and the comet's core's rotation, always points away from the Sun.  Comet 12P/Pons–Brooks is now visible with binoculars in the early evening sky toward the northwest, moving perceptibly from night to night.  The frequently flaring comet is expected to continue to brighten, on the average, and may even become visible with the unaided eye --  during the day -- to those in the path of totality of the coming solar eclipse on April 8.","comet, pons-brooks, tail, tell, discovered, erupting, dirty, snowball, loop, inner, solar, system, year, time, starting, show, deep, camera, exposure, featured, picture, light, blue, stream, consists, charged, molecule, pushed, nucleus, wind, shaped, core, rotation, point, visible, binoculars, evening, northwest, moving, night, flaring, expected, continue, brighten, average, become, unaided, path, totality, coming, eclipse, april"
The Coma Cluster of Galaxies,"Almost every object in the featured photograph is a galaxy.  The Coma Cluster of Galaxies pictured here is one of the densest clusters known - it contains thousands of galaxies.  Each of these galaxies houses billions of stars - just as our own Milky Way Galaxy does.  Although nearby when compared to most other clusters, light from the Coma Cluster still takes hundreds of millions of years to reach us.  In fact, the Coma Cluster is so big it takes light millions of years just to go from one side to the other.  Most galaxies in Coma and other clusters are ellipticals, while most galaxies outside of clusters are spirals.  The nature of Coma's X-ray emission is still being investigated.","coma, cluster, galaxy, object, featured, photograph, pictured, densest, known, contains, thousand, house, star, nearby, compared, light, take, year, reach, fact, side, ellipticals, outside, spiral, nature, x-ray, emission, investigated"
Millions of Stars in Omega Centauri,"Globular star cluster Omega Centauri, also known as NGC 5139, is 15,000 light-years away. The cluster is packed with about 10 million stars much older than the Sun within a volume about 150 light-years in diameter. It's the largest and brightest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. With a yellowish hue, Omega Centauri's red giant stars are easy to pick out in this sharp, color telescopic view.","star, omega, centauri, globular, cluster, known, light-year, packed, much, older, volume, diameter, largest, brightest, roam, halo, milky, galaxy, consist, composition, enigmatic, exhibit, presence, different, stellar, population, spread, chemical, abundance, fact, remnant, core, small, merging, yellowish, giant, easy, pick, sharp, color, telescopic, view"
Galileo's Europa,"Looping through the Jovian system in the late 1990s, the Galileo spacecraft recorded stunning views of Europa and uncovered evidence that the moon's icy surface likely hides a deep, global ocean. Galileo's Europa image data has been remastered here, with improved calibrations to produce a color image approximating what the human eye might see. Europa's long curving fractures hint at the subsurface liquid water.  The tidal flexing the large moon experiences in its elliptical orbit around Jupiter supplies the energy to keep the ocean liquid. But more tantalizing is the possibility that even in the absence of sunlight that process could also supply the energy to support life, making Europa one of the best places to look for life beyond Earth. The Juno spacecraft currently in Jovian orbit has also made repeated flybys of the water world, returning images along with data exploring Europa's habitability. This October will see the launch of the NASA's Europa Clipper on a voyage of exploration. The spacecraft will make nearly 50 flybys, approaching to within 25 kilometers of Europa's icy surface.","galileo, europa, looping, jovian, system, late, spacecraft, recorded, stunning, view, uncovered, evidence, moon, surface, likely, hide, deep, global, ocean, image, data, remastered, improved, calibration, produce, color, approximating, human, long, curving, fracture, hint, subsurface, liquid, water, tidal, flexing, large, experience, elliptical, orbit, jupiter, supply, energy, keep, tantalizing, possibility, absence, sunlight, process, support, life, making, best, place, look, earth, juno, made, repeated, flybys, world, returning, exploring, habitability, october, launch, nasa, clipper, voyage, exploration, make, approaching, kilometer"
Medieval Astronomy from Melk Abbey,"Discovered by accident, this manuscript page provides graphical insight to astronomy in medieval times, before the Renaissance and the influence of Nicolaus Copernicus, Tycho Brahe, Johannes Kepler, and Galileo. The intriguing page is from lecture notes on astronomy compiled by the monk Magister Wolfgang de Styria before the year 1490. The top panels clearly illustrate the necessary geometry for a lunar (left) and solar eclipse in the Earth-centered Ptolemaic system. At lower left is a diagram of the Ptolemaic view of the Solar System with text at the upper right to explain the movement of the planets according to Ptolemy's geocentric model.

Total Solar Eclipse Below the Bottom of the World,"In late 2021 there was a total solar eclipse visible only at the end of the Earth.  To capture the unusual phenomenon, airplanes took flight below the clouded seascape of Southern Ocean. The featured image shows one relatively spectacular capture where the bright spot is the outer corona of the Sun and the eclipsing Moon is seen as the dark spot in the center.  A wing and engine of the airplane are visible across the left and bottom of the image, while another airplane observing the eclipse is visible on the far left. The dark area of the sky surrounding the eclipsed Sun is called a shadow cone. It is dark because you are looking down a long corridor of air shadowed by the Moon. A careful inspection of the eclipsed Sun will reveal the planet Mercury just to the right. You won't have to travel to the end of the Earth to see the next total solar eclipse. The total eclipse path will cross North America on 2024 April 8, just over one week from today.

Swirling Magnetic Field around Our Galaxy's Central Black Hole,"What's happening to the big black hole in the center of our galaxy?  It is sucking in matter from a swirling disk -- a disk that is magnetized, it has now been confirmed. Specifically, the black hole's accretion disk has recently been seen to emit polarized light, radiation frequently associated with a magnetized source. Pictured here is a close-up of Sgr A*, our Galaxy's central black hole, taken by radio telescopes around the world participating in the Event Horizon Telescope (EHT) Collaboration.  Superposed are illustrative curved lines indicating polarized light likely emitted from swirling magnetized gas that will soon fall into the 4+ million solar mass central black hole.  The central part of this image is likely dark because little light-emitting gas is visible between us and the dark event horizon of the black hole.  Continued EHT monitoring of this and M87's central black hole may yield new clues about the gravity of black holes and how infalling matter creates disks and jets.

Detailed View of a Solar Eclipse Corona,"Only in the fleeting darkness of a total solar eclipse is the light of the solar corona easily visible. Normally overwhelmed by the bright solar disk, the expansive corona, the sun's outer atmosphere, is an alluring sight. But the subtle details and extreme ranges in the corona's brightness, although discernible to the eye, are notoriously difficult to photograph. Pictured here, however, using multiple images and digital processing, is a detailed image of the Sun's corona taken during the April 20, 2023 total solar eclipse from Exmouth, Australia. Clearly visible are intricate layers and glowing caustics of an ever changing mixture of hot gas and magnetic fields. Bright looping prominences appear pink just around the Sun's limb. A similar solar corona might be visible through clear skies in a narrow swath across the North America during the total solar eclipse that occurs just six days from today  NASA Coverage: Total Solar Eclipse of 2024 April 8","detailed, view, solar, eclipse, corona, fleeting, darkness, total, light, visible, overwhelmed, bright, disk, expansive, outer, alluring, sight, subtle, detail, extreme, range, brightness, discernible, difficult, photograph, pictured, using, multiple, image, digital, processing, taken, exmouth, australia, intricate, layer, glowing, caustic, changing, mixture, magnetic, field, looping, prominence, appear, pink, limb, similar, clear, narrow, swath, north, america, occurs, today, nasa, coverage, april"
Unusual Nebula Pa 30,"What created this unusual celestial firework? The nebula, dubbed Pa 30, appears in the same sky direction now as a bright ""guest star"" did in the year 1181. Although Pa 30's filaments look similar to that created by a nova (for example GK Per), and a planetary nebula (for example NGC 6751), some astronomers now propose that it was created by a rare type of supernova: a thermonuclear Type Iax, and so is (also) named SN 1181.  In this model, the supernova was not the result of the detonation of a single star, but rather a blast that occurred when two white dwarf stars spiraled together and merged.  The blue dot in the center is hypothesized to be a zombie star, the remnant white dwarf that somehow survived this supernova-level explosion.  The featured image combines images and data obtained with infrared (WISE), visible  (MDM, Pan-STARRS), and X-ray (Chandra, XMM) telescopes.  Future observations and analyses may tell us more.

Comet Pons-Brooks at Night,"In dark evening skies over June Lake, northern hemisphere, planet Earth, Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks stood just above the western horizon on March 30. Its twisted turbulent ion tail and diffuse greenish coma are captured in this two degree wide telescopic field of view along with bright yellowish star Hamal also known as Alpha Arietis. Now Pons-Brooks has moved out of the northern night though, approaching perihelion on April 21. On April 8 you might still spot the comet in daytime skies. But to do it, you will have to stand in the path of totality and look away from the spectacle of an alluring solar corona and totally eclipsed Sun.

The Solar Corona Unwrapped,"Changes in the alluring solar corona are detailed in this creative composite image mapping the dynamic outer atmosphere of the Sun during two separate total solar eclipses. Unwrapped from the complete circle of the eclipsed Sun's edge to a rectangle and mirrored, the entire solar corona is shown during the 2017 eclipse (bottom) seen from Jackson Hole, Wyoming, and the 2023 eclipse from Exmouth, Western Australia. While the 2017 eclipse was near a minimum in the Sun's 11 year activity cycle, the 2023 eclipse was closer to solar maximum. The 2023 solar corona hints at the dramatically different character of the active Sun, with many streamers and pinkish prominences arising along the solar limb. Of course, the solar corona is only easily visible to the eye while standing in the shadow of the Moon.

Unwinding M51,"The arms of a grand design spiral galaxy 60,000 light-years across are unwound in this digital transformation of the magnificent 2005 Hubble Space Telescope portrait of M51. In fact, M51 is one of the original spiral nebulae, its winding arms described by a mathematical curve known as a logarithmic spiral, a spiral whose separation grows in a geometric way with increasing distance from the center. Applying logarithms to shift the pixel coordinates in the Hubble image relative to the center of M51 maps the galaxy's spiral arms into diagonal straight lines. The transformed image dramatically shows the arms themselves are traced by star formation, lined with pinkish starforming regions and young blue star clusters. Companion galaxy NGC 5195 (top) seems to alter the track of the arm in front of it though, and itself remains relatively unaffected by this unwinding of M51. Also known as the spira mirabilis, logarthimic spirals can be found in nature on all scales. For example, logarithmic spirals can also describe hurricanes, the tracks of subatomic particles in a bubble chamber and, of course, cauliflower.

A Total Solar Eclipse over Wyoming,"Will the sky be clear enough to see the eclipse? This question is already on the minds of many North Americans hoping to see tomorrow's solar eclipse.  This question was also on the mind of many people attempting to see the total solar eclipse that crossed North America in August 2017.  Then, the path of total darkness shot across the mainland of the USA from coast to coast, from Oregon to South Carolina -- but, like tomorrow's event, a partial eclipse occurred above most of North America.  Unfortunately, in 2017, many locations saw predominantly clouds. One location that did not was a bank of the Green River Lakes, Wyoming.  Intermittent clouds were far enough away to allow the center image of the featured composite sequence to be taken, an image that shows the corona of the Sun extending out past the central dark Moon that blocks our familiar Sun. The surrounding images show the partial phases of the solar eclipse both before and after totality.

The Changing Ion Tail of Comet Pons-Brooks,"How does a comet tail change? It depends on the comet.  The ion tail of Comet 12P/Pons–Brooks has been changing markedly, as detailed in the featured image sequenced over nine days from March 6 to 14 (top to bottom).  On some days, the comet's ion tail was relatively long and complex, but not every day.  Reasons for tail changes include the rate of ejection of material from the comet's nucleus, the strength and complexity of the passing solar wind, and the rotation rate of the comet.  Over the course of a week, apparent changes even include a change of perspective from the Earth. In general, a comet's ion tail will point away from the Sun, as gas expelled is pushed out by the Sun's wind. Today, Pons-Brooks may become a rare comet suddenly visible in the middle of the day for those able to see the Sun totally eclipsed by the Moon.

Moon's Shadow over Lake Magog,"Captured in this snapshot, the shadow of the Moon came to Lake Magog, Quebec, North America, planet Earth on April 8. For the lakeside eclipse chasers, the much anticipated total solar eclipse was a spectacle to behold in briefly dark, but clear skies. Of course Lake Magog was one of the last places to be visited by the Moon's shadow.

Planets Around a Total Eclipse,"What wonders appear when the Moon blocks the Sun? For many eager observers of Monday’s total eclipse of the Sun, the suddenly dark sky included the expected corona and two (perhaps surprise) planets: Venus and Jupiter. Normally, in recent days, Venus is visible only in the morning when the Sun and Jupiter are below the horizon, while Jupiter appears bright only in the evening.  On Monday, though, for well-placed observers, both planets became easily visible during the day right in line with the totally eclipsed Sun.

How a Total Solar Eclipse Ended,"How does a total solar eclipse end? Yes, the Moon moves out from fully blocking the Sun, but in the first few seconds of transition, interesting things appear. The first is called a diamond ring. Light might stream between mountains or through relative lowlands around the Moon's edge, as seen from your location, making this sudden first light, when combined with the corona that surrounds the Moon, look like a diamond ring. Within seconds other light streams appear that are called, collectively, Bailey's beads. In the featured video, it may seem that the pink triangular prominence on the Sun is somehow related to where the Sun begins to reappear, but it is not. Observers from other locations saw Bailey's beads emerge from different places around the Moon, away from the iconic triangular solar prominence visible to all. The video was captured with specialized equipment from New Boston, Texas, USA on April 8, 2024.

The Cigar Galaxy from Hubble and Webb,"Something strange happened to this galaxy, but what? Known as the Cigar Galaxy and cataloged as M82, red glowing gas and dust are being cast out from the center.  Although this starburst galaxy was surely stirred up by a recent pass near its neighbor, large spiral galaxy M81, this doesn't fully explain the source of the red-glowing outwardly expanding gas and dust.  Evidence indicates that this material is being driven out by the combined emerging particle winds of many stars, together creating a galactic superwind. In the featured images, a Hubble Space Telescope image in visible light is shown on the left, while a James Webb Space Telescope image of the central region in infrared light is shown on the right.  Detailed inspection of the new Webb image shows, unexpectedly, that this red-glowing dust is associated with hot plasma.

Filaments of the Vela Supernova Remnant,"The explosion is over, but the consequences continue.  About eleven thousand years ago, a star in the constellation of Vela could be seen to explode, creating a strange point of light briefly visible to humans living near the beginning of recorded history.  The outer layers of the star crashed into the interstellar medium, driving a shock wave that is still visible today.  The featured image captures some of that filamentary and gigantic shock in visible light. As gas flies away from the detonated star, it decays and reacts with the interstellar medium, producing light in many different colors and energy bands. Remaining at the center of the Vela Supernova Remnant is a pulsar, a star as dense as nuclear matter that spins around more than ten times in a single second.

Total Eclipse and Comets,"Not one, but two comets appeared near the Sun during last week's total solar eclipse. The expected comet was Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, but it was disappointingly dimmer than many had hoped. However, relatively unknown Comet SOHO-5008 also appeared in long duration camera exposures. This comet was the 5008th comet identified on images taken by ESA & NASA's Sun-orbiting SOHO spacecraft.  Likely much smaller, Comet SOHO-5008 was a sungrazer which disintegrated within hours as it passed too near the Sun.  The featured image is not only unusual for capturing two comets during an eclipse, but one of the rare times that a sungrazing comet has been photographed from the Earth's surface. Also visible in the image is the sprawling corona of our Sun and the planets Mercury (left) and Venus (right).

Facing NGC 1232,"From our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy, we see NGC 1232 face-on. Nearly 200,000 light-years across, the big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located some 47 million light-years away in the flowing southern constellation of Eridanus. This sharp, multi-color, telescopic image of NGC 1232 includes remarkable details of the distant island universe. From the core outward, the galaxy's colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the grand, sweeping spiral arms. NGC 1232's apparent, small, barred-spiral companion galaxy is cataloged as NGC 1232A. Distance estimates place it much farther though, around 300 million light-years away, and unlikely to be interacting with NGC 1232.  Of course, the prominent bright star with the spiky appearance is much closer than NGC 1232 and lies well within our own Milky Way.","facing, vantage, point, milky, galaxy, face-on, light-year, beautiful, spiral, located, flowing, southern, constellation, eridanus, sharp, multi-color, telescopic, image, includes, remarkable, detail, distant, island, universe, core, outward, color, change, yellowish, light, star, center, young, blue, cluster, reddish, forming, region, grand, sweeping, apparent, small, barred-spiral, companion, cataloged, distance, estimate, place, much, farther, unlikely, interacting, course, prominent, bright, spiky, appearance"
The Great Carina Nebula,"A jewel of the southern sky, the Great Carina Nebula is more modestly known as NGC 3372. One of our Galaxy's largest star forming regions, it spans over 300 light-years. Like the smaller, more northerly Great Orion Nebula, the Carina Nebula is easily visible to the unaided eye. But at a distance of 7,500 light-years it lies some 5 times farther away. This stunning telescopic view reveals remarkable details of the region's glowing filaments of interstellar gas and obscuring cosmic dust clouds. The Carina Nebula is home to young, extremely massive stars, including the still enigmatic variable Eta Carinae, a star with well over 100 times the mass of the Sun.  Eta Carinae is the bright star above the central dark notch in this field and left of the dusty Keyhole Nebula (NGC 3324).","great, carina, nebula, jewel, southern, known, galaxy, largest, star, forming, region, span, light-year, smaller, orion, visible, unaided, distance, time, farther, stunning, telescopic, view, reveals, remarkable, detail, glowing, filament, interstellar, obscuring, cosmic, dust, cloud, home, young, massive, including, enigmatic, variable, mass, bright, central, dark, notch, field, left, dusty, keyhole"
Diamonds in the Sky,"When the dark shadow of the Moon raced across North America on April 8, sky watchers along the shadow's narrow central path were treated to a total solar eclipse. During the New Moon's shadow play diamonds glistened twice in the eclipse-darkened skies. The transient celestial jewels appeared immediately before and after the total eclipse phase. That's when the rays of a vanishing and then emerging sliver of solar disk are just visible behind the silhouetted Moon's edge, creating the appearance of a shiny diamond set in a dark ring. This dramatic timelapse composite from north-central Arkansas captures both diamond ring moments of this total solar eclipse. The diamond rings are separated by the ethereal beauty of the solar corona visible during totality.","diamond, dark, shadow, moon, raced, north, america, april, watcher, narrow, central, path, treated, total, solar, eclipse, play, glistened, eclipse-darkened, transient, celestial, jewel, appeared, phase, vanishing, emerging, sliver, disk, visible, silhouetted, edge, creating, appearance, shiny, ring, dramatic, timelapse, composite, north-central, arkansas, capture, moment, separated, ethereal, beauty, corona, totality"
Perijove 16: Passing Jupiter,"Watch Juno zoom past Jupiter.  NASA's robotic spacecraft Juno is continuing on its now month-long, highly-elongated orbits around our Solar System's largest planet.  The featured video is from perijove 16, the sixteenth time that Juno passed near Jupiter since it arrived in mid-2016. Each perijove passes near a slightly different part of Jupiter's cloud tops.  This color-enhanced video has been digitally composed from 21 JunoCam still images, resulting in a 125-fold time-lapse. The video begins with Jupiter rising as Juno approaches from the north. As Juno reaches its closest view -- from about 3,500 kilometers over Jupiter's cloud tops -- the spacecraft captures the great planet in tremendous detail. Juno passes light zones and dark belts of clouds that circle the planet, as well as numerous swirling circular storms, many of which are larger than hurricanes on Earth.  As Juno moves away, the remarkable dolphin-shaped cloud is visible.  After the perijove, Jupiter recedes into the distance, now displaying the unusual clouds that appear over Jupiter's south.  To get desired science data, Juno swoops so close to Jupiter that its instruments are exposed to very high levels of radiation.","perijove, passing, jupiter, watch, juno, zoom, nasa, robotic, spacecraft, continuing, month-long, highly-elongated, orbit, solar, system, largest, planet, featured, video, sixteenth, time, passed, arrived, mid-2016, pass, different, part, cloud, color-enhanced, composed, junocam, image, resulting, 125-fold, time-lapse, begin, rising, approach, north, reach, closest, view, kilometer, capture, great, tremendous, detail, light, dark, belt, circle, numerous, swirling, circular, storm, many, larger, hurricane, earth, move, remarkable, dolphin-shaped, visible, recedes, distance, displaying, unusual, appear, south, desired, science, data, swoop, close, instrument, exposed, high, level, radiation"
Moon and Smoke Rings from Mt. Etna,"Yes, but can your volcano do this? To the surprise of some, Mt. Etna emits, on occasion, smoke rings. Technically known as vortex rings, the walls of the volcano slightly slow the outside of emitted smoke puffs, causing the inside gas to move faster.  A circle of low pressure develops so that the emitted puff of volcanic gas and ash loops around in a ring, a familiar geometric structure that can be surprisingly stable as it rises. Smoke rings are quite rare and need a coincidence of the right geometry  of the vent, the right speed of ejected smoke, and the relative calmness of the outside atmosphere.  In the featured image taken about two weeks ago from Gangi, Sicily, Italy, multiple volcanic smoke rings are visible.  The scene is shaded by the red light of a dawn Sun, while a crescent Moon is visible in the background.","moon, smoke, ring, volcano, surprise, etna, emits, occasion, known, vortex, wall, slow, emitted, puff, causing, move, circle, pressure, develops, volcanic, loop, familiar, geometric, structure, stable, rise, rare, need, coincidence, right, geometry, vent, speed, ejected, relative, calmness, featured, image, taken, week, gangi, italy, multiple, visible, scene, shaded, light, dawn, crescent, background"
Contrail Shadow X,"What created this giant X in the clouds? It was the shadow of contrails. When airplanes fly, humid engine exhaust may form water droplets that might freeze in Earth's cold upper atmosphere.  These persistent streams of water and ice scatter light from the Sun above and so appear bright. These contrails cast long shadows.  That was just the case over Istanbul, Türkiye, earlier this month. Contrails occur all over planet Earth and, generally, warm the Earth when the trap infrared light but cool the Earth when they efficiently reflect sunlight. The image was taken by a surprised photographer in the morning on the way to work.","contrail, shadow, created, giant, cloud, airplane, humid, engine, exhaust, form, water, droplet, freeze, earth, cold, upper, persistent, stream, scatter, light, appear, bright, cast, case, istanbul, türkiye, month, occur, planet, warm, trap, infrared, cool, reflect, sunlight, image, taken, surprised, photographer, morning, work"
Dragon's Egg Bipolar Emission Nebula,"How did a star form this beautiful nebula?  In the middle of emission nebula NGC 6164 is an unusually massive star.  The central star has been compared to an oyster's pearl and an egg protected by the mythical sky dragons of Ara.  The star, visible in the center of the featured image and catalogued as HD 148937, is so hot that the ultraviolet light it emits heats up gas that surrounds it.  That gas was likely thrown off from the star previously, possibly the result of a gravitational interaction with a looping stellar companion.  Expelled material might have been channeled by the magnetic field of the massive star, in all creating the symmetric shape of the bipolar nebula.  NGC 6164 spans about four light years and is located about 3,600 light years away toward the southern constellation Norma.

NGC 604: Giant Stellar Nursery,"Located some 3 million light-years away in the arms of nearby spiral galaxy M33, giant stellar nursery NGC 604 is about 1,300 light-years across. That's nearly 100 times the size of the Milky Way's Orion Nebula, the closest large star forming region to planet Earth. In fact, among the star forming regions within the Local Group of galaxies, NGC 604 is second in size only to 30 Doradus, also known as the Tarantula Nebula in the Large Magellanic Cloud. Cavernous bubbles and cavities in NGC 604 fill this stunning infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRCam. They are carved out by energetic stellar winds from the region's more than 200 hot, massive, young stars, all still in early stages of their lives.","giant, stellar, nursery, located, light-year, nearby, spiral, galaxy, across, time, size, milky, orion, nebula, closest, large, star, forming, region, planet, earth, fact, local, group, second, doradus, known, tarantula, magellanic, cloud, cavernous, bubble, cavity, fill, stunning, infrared, image, james, webb, space, telescope, nircam, carved, energetic, wind, massive, young, early, stage, life"
Regulus and the Dwarf Galaxy,"In northern hemisphere spring, bright star Regulus is easy to spot above the eastern horizon. The alpha star of the constellation Leo, Regulus is the spiky star centered in this telescopic field of view. A mere 79 light-years distant, Regulus is a hot, rapidly spinning star that is known to be part of a multiple star system. Not quite lost in the glare, the fuzzy patch just below Regulus is diffuse starlight from small galaxy Leo I. Leo I is a dwarf spheroidal galaxy, a member of the Local Group of galaxies dominated by our Milky Way Galaxy and the Andromeda Galaxy (M31). About 800 thousand light-years away, Leo I is thought to be the most distant of the known small satellite galaxies orbiting the Milky Way. But dwarf galaxy Leo I has shown evidence of a supermassive black hole at its center, comparable in mass to the black hole at the center of the Milky Way.","regulus, dwarf, galaxy, northern, spring, bright, star, easy, spot, eastern, horizon, alpha, constellation, spiky, centered, telescopic, field, view, light-year, distant, spinning, known, part, multiple, system, lost, glare, fuzzy, patch, diffuse, starlight, small, spheroidal, member, local, group, dominated, milky, andromeda, thought, satellite, orbiting, shown, evidence, supermassive, black, hole, center, comparable, mass"
All Sky Moon Shadow,"If the Sun is up but the sky is dark and the horizon is bright all around, you might be standing in the Moon's shadow during a total eclipse of the Sun. In fact, the all-sky Moon shadow shown in this composited panoramic view was captured from a farm near Shirley, Arkansas, planet Earth. The exposures were made under clear skies during the April 8 total solar eclipse. For that location near the center line of the Moon's shadow track, totality lasted over 4 minutes. Along with the solar corona surrounding the silhouette of the Moon planets and stars were visible during the total eclipse phase. Easiest to see here are bright planets Venus and Jupiter, to the lower right and upper left of the eclipsed Sun.","moon, shadow, dark, horizon, bright, standing, total, eclipse, fact, all-sky, shown, composited, panoramic, view, captured, farm, shirley, arkansas, planet, earth, exposure, made, clear, april, solar, location, center, line, track, totality, lasted, minute, corona, surrounding, silhouette, star, visible, phase, easiest, venus, jupiter, lower, right, upper, left, eclipsed"
Rings Around the Ring Nebula,"The Ring Nebula (M57) is more complicated than it appears through a small telescope.  The easily visible central ring is about one light-year across, but this remarkably deep exposure - a collaborative effort combining data from three different large telescopes - explores the looping filaments of glowing gas extending much farther from the nebula's central star. This composite image includes red light emitted by hydrogen as well as visible and infrared light. The Ring Nebula is an elongated planetary nebula, a type of nebula created when a Sun-like star evolves to throw off its outer atmosphere and become a white dwarf star.  The Ring Nebula is about 2,500 light-years away toward the musical constellation Lyra.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

The most familiar was the Moon, seen on the upper left in a crescent phase. The rest of the Moon was faintly visible by sunlight first reflected by the Earth. The bright planet Jupiter, the largest planet in the Solar System, is seen to the upper left.  Most unusual was Comet 12P/Pons-Brooks, below the Moon and showing a stubby dust tail on the right but an impressive ion tail extending upwards.  The featured image, a composite of several images taken consecutively at the same location and with the same camera, was taken near the village of Llers, in Spain's Girona province.

GK Per: Nova and Planetary Nebula,"The star system GK Per is known to be associated with only two of the three nebulas pictured.  At 1500 light years distant, Nova Persei 1901 (GK Persei) was the second closest nova yet recorded. At the very center is a white dwarf star, the surviving core of a former Sun-like star. It is surrounded by the circular Firework nebula, gas that was ejected by a thermonuclear explosion on the white dwarf's surface -- a nova -- as recorded in 1901. The red glowing gas surrounding the Firework nebula is the atmosphere that used to surround the central star. This gas was expelled before the nova and appears as a diffuse planetary nebula.  The faint gray gas running across is interstellar cirrus that seems to be just passing through coincidently. In 1901, GK Per's nova became brighter than Betelgeuse. Similarly, star system T CrB is expected to erupt in a nova later this year, but we don't know exactly when nor how bright it will become.","planetary, nebula, star, system, known, associated, pictured, light, year, distant, nova, persei, second, closest, recorded, center, white, dwarf, surviving, core, former, sun-like, surrounded, circular, firework, ejected, thermonuclear, explosion, surface, glowing, surrounding, used, surround, central, expelled, appears, faint, gray, running, interstellar, cirrus, seems, passing, became, brighter, betelgeuse, expected, know, bright, become"
IC 1795: The Fishhead Nebula,"To some, this nebula looks like the head of a fish. However, this colorful cosmic portrait really features glowing gas and obscuring dust clouds in IC 1795, a star forming region in the northern constellation Cassiopeia. The nebula's colors were created by adopting the Hubble color palette for mapping narrowband emissions from oxygen, hydrogen, and sulfur atoms to blue, green and red colors, and further blending the data with images of the region recorded through broadband filters. Not far on the sky from the famous Double Star Cluster in Perseus, IC 1795 is itself located next to IC 1805, the Heart Nebula, as part of a complex of star forming regions that lie at the edge of a large molecular cloud. Located just over 6,000 light-years away, the larger star forming complex sprawls along the Perseus spiral arm of our Milky Way Galaxy.

M100: A Grand Design Spiral Galaxy,"Majestic on a truly cosmic scale, M100 is appropriately known as a grand design spiral galaxy.  The large galaxy of over 100 billion stars has well-defined spiral arms, similar to our own Milky Way.  One of the brightest members of the Virgo Cluster of galaxies, M100, also known as NGC 4321 is 56 million light-years distant toward the well-groomed constellation Coma Berenices.  In this telescopic image, the face-on grand design spiral shares a nearly 1 degree wide field-of-view with slightly less conspicuous edge-on spiral NGC 4312 (at upper right). The 21 hour long equivalent exposure from a dark sky site near Flagstaff, Arizona, planet Earth, reveals M100's bright blue star clusters and intricate winding dust lanes which are hallmarks of this class of galaxies.

Temperatures on Exoplanet WASP-43b,"A mere 280 light-years from Earth, tidally locked, Jupiter-sized exoplanet WASP-43b orbits its parent star once every 0.8 Earth days. That puts it about 2 million kilometers (less than 1/25th the orbital distance of Mercury) from a small, cool sun. Still, on a dayside always facing its parent star, temperatures approach a torrid 2,500 degrees F as measured at infrared wavelengths by the MIRI instrument on board the James Webb Space Telescope. In this illustration of the hot exoplanet's orbit, Webb measurements also show nightside temperatures remain above 1,000 degrees F. That suggests that strong equatorial winds circulate the dayside atmospheric gases to the nightside before they can completely cool off. Exoplanet WASP-43b is now formally known as Astrolábos, and its K-type parent star has been christened Gnomon. Webb's infrared spectra indicate water vapor is present on the nightside as well as the dayside of the planet, providing information about cloud cover on Astrolábos.","temperature, exoplanet, wasp-43b, mere, light-year, earth, locked, jupiter-sized, orbit, parent, star, kilometer, 1/25th, orbital, distance, mercury, small, cool, dayside, facing, approach, torrid, degree, measured, infrared, wavelength, miri, instrument, board, james, webb, space, telescope, illustration, measurement, show, nightside, remain, suggests, strong, equatorial, wind, circulate, known, astrolábos, k-type, christened, gnomon, spectrum, indicate, water, vapor, present, planet, providing, information, cloud, cover"
3 ATs,"Despite their resemblance to R2D2, these three are not the droids you're looking for. Instead, the enclosures house 1.8 meter Auxiliary Telescopes (ATs) at Paranal Observatory in the Atacama Desert region of Chile. The ATs are designed to be used for interferometry, a technique for achieving extremely high resolution observations, in concert with the observatory's 8 meter Very Large Telescope units. A total of four ATs are operational, each fitted with a transporter that moves the telescope along a track allowing different arrays with the large unit telescopes. To work as an interferometer, the light from each telescope is brought to a common focal point by a system of mirrors in underground tunnels. Above these three ATs, the Large and Small Magellanic Clouds are the far, far away satellite galaxies of our own Milky Way. In the clear and otherwise dark southern skies, planet Earth's greenish atmospheric airglow stretches faintly along the horizon.","resemblance, r2d2, droids, looking, enclosure, house, meter, auxiliary, telescope, paranal, observatory, atacama, desert, region, chile, designed, used, interferometry, technique, achieving, high, resolution, observation, concert, large, unit, total, operational, fitted, transporter, move, track, allowing, different, array, work, interferometer, light, brought, common, focal, point, system, mirror, underground, tunnel, small, magellanic, cloud, satellite, galaxy, milky, clear, dark, southern, planet, earth, greenish, atmospheric, airglow, stretch, horizon"
A Black Hole Disrupts a Passing Star,"What happens to a star that goes near a black hole? If the star directly impacts a massive black hole, then the star falls in completely -- and everything vanishes. More likely, though, the star goes close enough to have the black hole's gravity pull away its outer layers, or disrupt, the star. Then, most of the star's gas does not fall into the black hole.  These stellar tidal disruption events can be as bright as a supernova, and an increasing amount of them are being discovered by automated sky surveys. In the featured artist's illustration, a star has just passed a massive black hole and sheds gas that continues to orbit.  The inner edge of a disk of gas and dust surrounding the black hole is heated by the disruption event and may glow long after the star  is gone.

A Total Solar Eclipse from Sliver to Ring,"This is how the Sun disappeared from the daytime sky last month. The featured time-lapse video was created from stills taken from Mountain View, Arkansas, USA on 2024 April 8. First, a small sliver of a normally spotted Sun went strangely dark. Within a few minutes, much of the background Sun was hidden behind the advancing foreground Moon. Within an hour, the only rays from the Sun passing the Moon appeared like a diamond ring. During totality, most of the surrounding sky went dark, making the bright pink prominences around the Sun's edge stand out, and making the amazing corona appear to spread into the surrounding sky.  The central view of the corona shows an accumulation of frames taken during complete totality. As the video ends, just a few minutes later, another diamond ring appeared -- this time on the other side of the Moon. Within the next hour, the sky returned to normal.

Black Hole Accreting with Jet,"What happens when a black hole devours a star?  Many details remain unknown, but observations are providing new clues. In 2014, a powerful explosion was recorded by the ground-based robotic telescopes of the All Sky Automated Survey for SuperNovae (Project ASAS-SN), with followed-up observations by instruments including NASA's Earth-orbiting Swift satellite. Computer modeling of these emissions fit a star being ripped apart by a distant supermassive black hole.  The results of such a collision are portrayed in the featured artistic illustration. The black hole itself is a depicted as a tiny black dot in the center. As matter falls toward the hole, it collides with other matter and heats up. Surrounding the black hole is an accretion disk of hot matter that used to be the star, with a jet emanating from the black hole's spin axis.

Visualization: A Black Hole Accretion Disk,"What would it look like to circle a black hole? If the black hole was surrounded by a swirling disk of glowing and accreting gas, then the great gravity of the black hole would deflect light emitted by the disk to make it look very unusual. The featured animated video gives a visualization. The video starts with you, the observer, looking toward the black hole from just above the plane of the accretion disk.  Surrounding the central black hole is a thin circular image of the orbiting disk that marks the position of the photon sphere -- inside of which lies the black hole's event horizon.  Toward the left, parts of the large main image of the disk appear brighter as they move toward you. As the video continues, you loop over the black hole, soon looking down from the top, then passing through the disk plane on the far side, then returning to your original vantage point. The accretion disk does some interesting image inversions -- but never appears flat. Visualizations such as this are particularly relevant today as black holes are being imaged in unprecedented detail by the Event Horizon Telescope.

"The Galaxy, the Jet, and a Famous Black Hole","Bright elliptical galaxy Messier 87 (M87) is home to the supermassive black hole captured in 2017 by planet Earth's Event Horizon Telescope in the first ever image of a black hole. Giant of the Virgo galaxy cluster about 55 million light-years away, M87 is rendered in blue hues in this infrared image from the Spitzer Space telescope.  Though M87 appears mostly featureless and cloud-like, the Spitzer image does record details of relativistic jets blasting from the galaxy's central region. Shown in the inset at top right, the jets themselves span thousands of light-years. The brighter jet seen on the right is approaching and close to our line of sight. Opposite, the shock created by the otherwise unseen receding jet lights up a fainter arc of material. Inset at bottom right, the historic black hole image is shown in context at the center of giant galaxy, between the relativistic jets. Completely unresolved in the Spitzer image, the supermassive black hole surrounded by infalling material is the source of enormous energy driving the relativistic jets from the center of active galaxy M87.

Simulation: Two Black Holes Merge,"Relax and watch two black holes merge. Inspired by the first direct detection of gravitational waves in 2015, this simulation plays in slow motion but would take about one third of a second if run in real time. Set on a cosmic stage, the black holes are posed in front of stars, gas, and dust. Their extreme gravity lenses the light from behind them into Einstein rings as they spiral closer and finally merge into one. The otherwise invisible gravitational waves generated as the massive objects rapidly coalesce cause the visible image to ripple and slosh both inside and outside the Einstein rings even after the black holes have merged. Dubbed GW150914, the gravitational waves detected by LIGO are consistent with the merger of 36 and 31 solar mass black holes at a distance of 1.3 billion light-years. The final, single black hole has 63 times the mass of the Sun, with the remaining 3 solar masses converted into energy radiated in gravitational waves.

AR 3664: Giant Sunspot Group,"Right now, one of the largest sunspot groups in recent history is crossing the Sun. Active Region 3664 is not only big -- it's violent, throwing off clouds of particles into the Solar System. Some of these CMEs are already impacting the Earth, and others might follow.  At the extreme, these solar storms could cause some Earth-orbiting satellites to malfunction, the Earth's atmosphere to slightly distort, and electrical power grids to surge. When impacting Earth's upper atmosphere, these particles can produce beautiful auroras, with some auroras already being reported unusually far south.  Pictured here, AR3664 and its dark sunspots were captured yesterday in visible light from Rome, Italy. The AR3664 sunspot group is so large that it is visible just with glasses designed to view last month's total solar eclipse.  This weekend, skygazing enthusiasts will be keenly watching the night skies all over the globe for bright and unusual auroras.

Red Aurora over Poland,"Northern lights don't usually reach this far south.  Magnetic chaos in the Sun's huge Active Region 3664, however, produced a surface explosion that sent a burst of electrons, protons, and more massive, charged nuclei into the Solar System. A few days later, that coronal mass ejection (CME) impacted the Earth and triggered auroras that are being reported unusually far from our planet's north and south poles.  The free sky show might not be over -- the sunspot rich AR3664 has ejected even more CMEs that might also impact the Earth tonight or tomorrow. That active region is now near the Sun's edge, though, and will soon be rotating away from the Earth.

AR 3664 on a Setting Sun,"It was larger than the Earth. It was so big you could actually see it on the Sun's surface without magnification. It contained powerful and tangled magnetic fields as well as numerous dark sunspots. Labelled AR 3664, it developed into one of the most energetic areas seen on the Sun in recent years, unleashing a series of explosions that led to a surge of energetic particles striking the Earth, which created beautiful auroras. And might continue.  Although active regions on the Sun like AR 3664 can be quite dangerous, this region's Coronal Mass Ejections have not done, as yet, much damage to Earth-orbiting satellites or Earth-surface electrical grids. Pictured, the enormous active region was captured on the setting Sun a few days ago from  Civitavecchia, Rome, Italy. The composite image includes a very short exposure taken of just the Sun's surface, but mimics what was actually visible.  Finally, AR 3664 is now rotating away from the Earth, although the region may survive long enough to come around again.

The 37 Cluster,"For the mostly harmless denizens of planet Earth, the brighter stars of open cluster NGC 2169 seem to form a cosmic 37. Did you expect 42? From our perspective, the improbable numerical asterism appears solely by chance. It lies at an estimated distance of 3,300 light-years toward the constellation Orion. As far as galactic or open star clusters go, NGC 2169 is a small one, spanning about 7 light-years.  Formed at the same time from the same cloud of dust and gas, the stars of NGC 2169 are only about 11 million years old. Such clusters are expected to disperse over time as they encounter other stars, interstellar clouds, and experience gravitational tides while hitchhiking through the galaxy. Over four billion years ago, our own Sun was likely formed in a similar open cluster of stars.

AR 3664 at the Sun's Edge,"What did the monster active region that created the recent auroras look like when at the Sun's edge? There, AR 3664 better showed its 3D structure. Pictured, a large multi-pronged solar prominence was captured extending from chaotic sunspot region AR 3664 out into space, just one example of the particle clouds ejected from this violent solar region. The Earth could easily fit under this long-extended prominence.  The featured image was captured two days ago from this constantly changing region. Yesterday, the strongest solar flare in years was expelled (not shown), a blast classified in the upper X-class. Ultraviolet light from that flare quickly hit the Earth's atmosphere and caused shortwave radio blackouts across both North and South America. Although now rotated to be facing slightly away from the Earth, particles from AR 3664 and subsequent coronal mass ejections (CMEs) might still follow curved magnetic field lines across the inner Solar System and create more Earthly auroras.

Aurora Georgia,"A familiar sight from Georgia, USA, the Moon sets near the western horizon in this rural night skyscape. Captured on May 10 before local midnight, the image overexposes the Moon's bright waxing crescent at left in the frame. A long irrigation rig stretches across farmland about 15 miles north of the city of Bainbridge. Shimmering curtains of aurora shine across the starry sky, definitely an unfamiliar sight for southern Georgia nights. Last weekend, extreme geomagnetic storms triggered by the recent intense activity from solar active region AR 3664 brought epic displays of aurora, usually seen closer to the poles, to southern Georgia and even lower latitudes on planet Earth. As solar activity ramps up, more storms are possible.

Still, captured on May 11, vibrant aurora australis dominate the starry southern sea and skyscape. The shimmering southern lights were part of extensive auroral displays that entertained skywatchers in northern and southern hemispheres around planet Earth, caused by intense geomagnetic storms.

To create the timelapse composite, on May 12 consecutive exposures were recorded with a camera fixed to a tripod on the shores of the Ashokan Reservoir, in the Catskills region of New York, USA. North star Polaris is near the center of the star trail arcs. The broad trail of a waxing crescent Moon is on the left, casting a strong reflection across the reservoir waters.

Jupiter Diving,"Take this simulated plunge and dive into the upper atmosphere of Jupiter, the Solar System's ruling gas giant. The awesome animation is based on image data from JunoCam, and the microwave radiometer on board the Jupiter-orbiting Juno spacecraft. Your view will start about 3,000 kilometers above the southern Jovian cloud tops, and you can track your progress on the display at the left. As altitude decreases, temperature increases while you dive deeper at the location of Jupiter's famous Great Red Spot. In fact, Juno data indicates the Great Red Spot, the Solar System's largest storm system, penetrates some 300 kilometers into the giant planet's atmosphere.

Aurora Dome Sky,"It seemed like night, but part of the sky glowed purple.  It was the now famous night of May 10, 2024, when people over much of the world reported beautiful aurora-filled skies. The featured image was captured this night during early morning hours from Arlington, Wisconsin, USA. The panorama is a composite of several 6-second exposures covering two thirds of the visible sky, with north in the center, and processed to heighten the colors and remove electrical wires. The photographer (in the foreground) reported that the aurora appeared to flow from a point overhead but illuminated the sky only toward the north. The aurora's energetic particles originated from CMEs ejected from our Sun over sunspot AR 3664 a few days before. This large active region rotated to the far side of the Sun last week, but may well survive to rotate back toward the Earth next week.","aurora, dome, seemed, night, part, glowed, famous, people, much, world, reported, beautiful, aurora-filled, featured, image, captured, morning, hour, arlington, wisconsin, panorama, composite, several, 6-second, exposure, covering, third, visible, north, center, processed, heighten, color, remove, electrical, wire, photographer, foreground, appeared, flow, point, overhead, illuminated, energetic, particle, originated, cmes, ejected, sunspot, large, active, region, rotated, side, last, week, survive, rotate, earth, next"
CG4: The Globule and the Galaxy,"Can a gas cloud eat a galaxy?  It's not even close.  The ""claw"" of this odd looking ""creature"" in the featured photo is a gas cloud known as a cometary globule.  This globule, however, has ruptured.  Cometary globules are typically characterized by dusty heads and elongated tails.  These features cause cometary globules to have visual similarities to comets, but in reality they are very much different.  Globules are frequently the birthplaces of stars, and many show very young stars in their heads. The reason for the rupture in the head of this object is not yet known. The galaxy to the left of the globule is huge, very far in the distance, and only placed near CG4 by chance superposition.","globule, galaxy, cloud, close, claw, looking, creature, featured, photo, known, cometary, ruptured, characterized, dusty, head, elongated, tail, feature, cause, visual, similarity, comet, reality, different, birthplace, many, show, young, star, reason, rupture, object, left, huge, distance, placed, chance, superposition"
Green Aurora over Sweden,"It was bright and green and stretched across the sky. This striking aurora display was captured in 2016 just outside of Östersund, Sweden. Six photographic fields were merged to create the featured panorama spanning almost 180 degrees.  Particularly striking aspects of this aurora include its sweeping arc-like shape and its stark definition.  Lake Storsjön is seen in the foreground, while several familiar constellations and the star Polaris are visible through the aurora, far in the background.  Coincidently, the aurora appears to avoid the Moon visible on the lower left.  The aurora appeared a day after a large hole opened in the Sun's corona, allowing particularly energetic particles to flow out into the Solar System.  The green color of the aurora is caused by oxygen atoms recombining with ambient electrons high in the Earth's atmosphere.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

Unraveling NGC 3169,"Spiral galaxy NGC 3169 looks to be unraveling like a ball of cosmic yarn. It lies some 70 million light-years away, south of bright star Regulus toward the faint constellation Sextans. Wound up spiral arms are pulled out into sweeping tidal tails as NGC 3169 (left) and neighboring NGC 3166 interact gravitationally. Eventually the galaxies will merge into one, a common fate even for bright galaxies in the local universe. Drawn out stellar arcs and plumes are clear indications of the ongoing gravitational interactions across the deep and colorful galaxy group photo. The telescopic frame spans about 20 arc minutes or about 400,000 light-years at the group's estimated distance, and includes smaller, bluish NGC 3165 to the right.

M78 from the Euclid Space Telescope,"Star formation can be messy. To help find out just how messy, ESA's new Sun-orbiting Euclid telescope recently captured the most detailed image ever of the bright star forming region M78. Near the image center, M78 lies at a distance of only about 1,300 light-years away and has a main glowing core that spans about 5 light-years.  The featured image was taken in both visible and infrared light. The purple tint in M78's center is caused by dark dust preferentially reflecting the blue light of hot, young stars.  Complex dust lanes and filaments can be traced through this gorgeous and revealing skyscape. On the upper left is associated star forming region NGC 2071, while a third region of star formation is visible on the lower right.

Manicouagan Impact Crater from Space,"Orbiting 400 kilometers above Quebec, Canada, planet Earth, the International Space Station Expedition 59 crew captured this snapshot of the broad St. Lawrence River and curiously circular Lake Manicouagan on April 11. Right of center, the ring-shaped lake is a modern reservoir within the eroded remnant of an ancient 100 kilometer diameter impact crater. The ancient crater is very conspicuous from orbit, a visible reminder that Earth is vulnerable to rocks from space. Over 200 million years old, the Manicouagan crater was likely caused by the impact of a rocky body about 5 kilometers in diameter.  Currently, there is no known asteroid with a significant probability of impacting Earth in the next century.  Each month, NASA’s Planetary Defense Coordination Office releases an update featuring the most recent figures on near-Earth object close approaches, and other facts about comets and asteroids that could pose a potential impact hazard with Earth.","manicouagan, impact, crater, space, orbiting, kilometer, quebec, canada, planet, earth, international, station, expedition, crew, captured, snapshot, broad, lawrence, river, circular, lake, april, right, center, ring-shaped, modern, reservoir, eroded, remnant, ancient, diameter, conspicuous, orbit, visible, reminder, vulnerable, rock, year, likely, caused, rocky, body, known, asteroid, significant, probability, impacting, next, century, month, nasa, planetary, defense, coordination, office, release, update, featuring, recent, figure, near-earth, object, close, approach, fact, comet, pose, potential, hazard"
A Solar Filament Erupts,"What's happened to our Sun?  Nothing very unusual -- it just threw a filament. Toward the middle of 2012, a long standing solar filament suddenly erupted into space, producing an energetic coronal mass ejection (CME).  The filament had been held up for days by the Sun's ever changing magnetic field and the timing of the eruption was unexpected. Watched closely by the Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory, the resulting explosion shot electrons and ions into the Solar System, some of which arrived at Earth three days later and impacted Earth's magnetosphere, causing visible auroras. Loops of plasma surrounding the active region can be seen above the erupting filament in the featured ultraviolet image. Our Sun is nearing the most active time in its 11-year cycle, creating many coronal holes that allow for the ejection of charged particles into space. As before, these charged particles can create auroras.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

Chamaeleon I Molecular Cloud,"Dark markings and bright nebulae in this telescopic southern sky view are telltale signs of young stars and active star formation. They lie a mere 650 light-years away, at the boundary of the local bubble and the Chamaeleon molecular cloud complex. Regions with young stars identified as dusty reflection nebulae from the 1946 Cederblad catalog include the C-shaped Ced 110 just above and right of center, and bluish Ced 111 below it. Also a standout in the frame, the orange tinted V-shape of the Chamaeleon Infrared Nebula (Cha IRN) was carved by material streaming from a newly formed low-mass star.

Solar X Flare as Famous Active Region Returns,"It's back. The famous active region on the Sun that created auroras visible around the Earth earlier this month has survived its rotation around the far side of the Sun -- and returned.  Yesterday, as it was beginning to reappear on the Earth-facing side, the region formerly labeled AR 3664 threw another major solar flare, again in the highest-energy X-class range. The featured video shows the emerging active region on the lower left, as it was captured by NASA's Earth-orbiting Solar Dynamics Observatory yesterday in ultraviolet light. The video is a time-lapse of the entire Sun rotating over 24 hours.  Watch the lower-left region carefully at about the 2-second mark to see the powerful flare burst out.

Stairway to the Milky Way,"What happens if you ascend this stairway to the Milky Way? Before answering that, let's understand the beautiful sky you will see.  Most eye-catching is the grand arch of the Milky Way Galaxy, the band that is the central disk of our galaxy which is straight but distorted by the wide-angle nature of this composite image.  Many stars well in front of the Milk Way will be visible, with the bright white star just below the stellar arch being Altair, and the bright blue star above it being Vega.  The air glows green on the left, just above the yellow cloud deck.  The featured image was taken last month on Portugal's Madeira Island in the North Atlantic Ocean.

A Lunar Corona over Paris,"Why does a cloudy moon sometimes appear colorful? The effect, called a lunar corona, is created by the quantum mechanical diffraction of light around individual, similarly-sized water droplets in an intervening but mostly-transparent cloud. Since light of different colors has different wavelengths, each color diffracts differently. Lunar coronae are one of the few  quantum mechanical color effects that can be easily seen with the unaided eye.  Solar coronae are also sometimes evident. The featured image was taken last month from Paris, France.  The blue beacon emanating from the Eiffel Tower did not affect the colorful lunar corona.

The Nebulous Realm of WR 134,"Made with narrowband filters, this cosmic snapshot covers a field of view over twice as wide as the full Moon within the boundaries of the constellation Cygnus. It highlights the bright edge of a ring-like nebula traced by the glow of ionized hydrogen and oxygen gas. Embedded in the region's expanse of interstellar clouds, the complex, glowing arcs are sections of shells of material swept up by the wind from Wolf-Rayet star WR 134, brightest star near the center of the frame. Distance estimates put WR 134 about 6,000 light-years away, making the frame over 100 light-years across. Shedding their outer envelopes in powerful stellar winds, massive Wolf-Rayet stars have burned through their nuclear fuel at a prodigious rate and end this final phase of massive star evolution in a spectacular supernova explosion. The stellar winds and final supernova enrich the interstellar material with heavy elements to be incorporated in future generations of stars.","nebulous, realm, made, narrowband, filter, cosmic, snapshot, cover, field, view, wide, full, moon, boundary, constellation, cygnus, highlight, bright, edge, ring-like, nebula, traced, glow, ionized, hydrogen, oxygen, embedded, region, expanse, interstellar, cloud, complex, glowing, section, shell, material, swept, wolf-rayet, star, brightest, center, frame, distance, estimate, light-year, making, shedding, outer, envelope, powerful, stellar, wind, massive, burned, nuclear, fuel, prodigious, rate, final, phase, evolution, spectacular, supernova, explosion, enrich, heavy, element, incorporated, future, generation"
Stereo Helene,"Get out your red/blue glasses and float next to Helene, small, icy moon of Saturn. Appropriately named, Helene is a Trojan moon, so called because it orbits at a Lagrange point. A Lagrange point is a gravitationally stable position near two massive bodies, in this case Saturn and larger moon Dione. In fact, irregularly shaped ( about 36 by 32 by 30 kilometers) Helene orbits at Dione's leading Lagrange point while brotherly ice moon Polydeuces follows at Dione's trailing Lagrange point. The sharp stereo anaglyph was constructed from two Cassini images captured during a close flyby in 2011.

Rotating Moon from LRO,"No one, presently, sees the Moon rotate like this. That's because the Earth's moon is tidally locked to the Earth, showing us only one side.  Given modern digital technology, however, combined with many detailed images returned by the Lunar Reconnaissance Orbiter (LRO), a high resolution virtual Moon rotation movie has been composed. The featured time-lapse video starts with the standard Earth view of the Moon. Quickly, though, Mare Orientale, a large crater with a dark center that is difficult to see from the Earth, rotates into view just below the equator.  From an entire lunar month condensed into 24 seconds, the video clearly shows that the Earth side of the Moon contains an abundance of dark lunar maria, while the lunar far side is dominated by bright lunar highlands. Currently, over 32 new missions to the Moon are under active development from multiple countries and companies, including NASA's Artemis program which aims to land people on the Moon again within the next few years.","rotating, moon, rotate, earth, locked, showing, side, given, modern, digital, technology, combined, many, detailed, image, returned, lunar, reconnaissance, orbiter, high, resolution, virtual, rotation, movie, composed, featured, time-lapse, video, start, standard, view, mare, orientale, large, crater, dark, center, difficult, rotates, equator, entire, month, condensed, second, show, contains, abundance, maria, dominated, bright, highland, mission, active, development, multiple, country, company, including, nasa, artemis, program, land, people, next, year"
NGC 2403 in Camelopardalis,"Magnificent island universe NGC 2403 stands within the boundaries of the long-necked constellation Camelopardalis. Some 10 million light-years distant and about 50,000 light-years across, the spiral galaxy also seems to have more than its fair share of giant star forming HII regions, marked by the telltale reddish glow of atomic hydrogen gas. The giant HII regions are energized by clusters of hot, massive stars that explode as bright supernovae at the end of their short and furious lives. A member of the M81 group of galaxies, NGC 2403 closely resembles a galaxy in our own local galaxy group with an abundance of star forming regions, M33, the Triangulum Galaxy. Spiky in appearance, bright stars in this portrait of NGC 2403 are in the foreground, within our own Milky Way. Also in the foreground of the deep, wide-field, telescopic image are the Milky Way's dim and dusty interstellar clouds also known as galactic cirrus or integrated flux nebulae. But faint features that seem to extend from NGC 2403 itself are likely tidal stellar streams drawn out by gravitational interactions with neighboring galaxies.","camelopardalis, magnificent, island, universe, stand, boundary, long-necked, constellation, light-year, distant, spiral, galaxy, seems, fair, share, giant, star, forming, region, marked, telltale, reddish, glow, atomic, hydrogen, energized, cluster, massive, explode, bright, supernova, short, furious, life, member, group, resembles, local, abundance, triangulum, spiky, appearance, portrait, foreground, milky, deep, wide-field, telescopic, image, dusty, interstellar, cloud, known, galactic, cirrus, integrated, flux, nebula, faint, feature, seem, likely, tidal, stellar, stream, drawn, gravitational, interaction, neighboring"
Comet Pons-Brooks Develops Opposing Tails,"Why does Comet Pons-Brooks now have tails pointing in opposite directions?  The most spectacular tail is the blue-glowing ion tail that is visible flowing down the image.  The ion tail is pushed directly out from the Sun by the solar wind. On the upper right is the glowing central coma of Comet 12P/Pons–Brooks. Fanning out from the coma, mostly to the left, is the comet's dust tail. Pushed out and slowed down by the pressure of sunlight, the dust tail tends to trail the comet along its orbit and, from some viewing angles, can appear opposite to the ion tail.  The distant, bright star Alpha Leporis is seen at the bottom of the featured image captured last week from Namibia. Two days ago, the comet passed its closest to the Earth and is now best visible from southern skies as it dims and glides back to the outer Solar System.","comet, pons-brooks, develops, opposing, tail, pointing, opposite, direction, spectacular, blue-glowing, visible, flowing, image, pushed, solar, wind, upper, right, glowing, central, coma, fanning, left, dust, slowed, pressure, sunlight, tends, trail, orbit, viewing, angle, appear, distant, bright, star, alpha, leporis, seen, bottom, featured, captured, last, week, namibia, passed, closest, earth, southern, dims, glide, system"
Shadow of a Martian Robot,"What if you saw your shadow on Mars and it wasn't human?  Then you might be the Perseverance rover exploring Mars.  Perseverance has been examining the Red Planet since 2021, finding evidence of its complex history of volcanism and ancient flowing water, and sending breathtaking images across the inner Solar System.

NGC 4565: Galaxy on Edge,"Magnificent spiral galaxy NGC 4565 is viewed edge-on from planet Earth. Also known as the Needle Galaxy for its narrow profile, bright NGC 4565 is a stop on many telescopic tours of the northern sky, in the faint but well-groomed constellation Coma Berenices. This sharp, colorful image reveals the galaxy's boxy, bulging central core cut by obscuring dust lanes that lace NGC 4565's thin galactic plane. NGC 4565 itself lies about 40 million light-years distant and spans some 100,000 light-years.  Easily spotted with small telescopes, sky enthusiasts consider NGC 4565 to be a prominent celestial masterpiece Messier missed.","galaxy, edge, magnificent, spiral, viewed, edge-on, planet, earth, known, needle, narrow, profile, bright, stop, many, tour, northern, faint, well-groomed, constellation, coma, berenices, sharp, colorful, image, reveals, boxy, bulging, central, core, obscuring, dust, lane, lace, thin, galactic, plane, light-year, distant, span, spotted, small, telescope, enthusiast, consider, prominent, celestial, masterpiece, messier, missed"
SH2-308: The Dolphin Head Nebula,"Blown by fast winds from a hot, massive star, this cosmic bubble is huge. Cataloged as Sharpless 2-308 it lies some 5,000 light-years away toward the well-trained constellation Canis Major and covers slightly more of the sky than a Full Moon. That corresponds to a diameter of 60 light-years at its estimated distance. The massive star that created the bubble, a Wolf-Rayet star, is the bright one near the center of the nebula. Wolf-Rayet stars have over 20 times the mass of the Sun and are thought to be in a brief, pre-supernova phase of massive star evolution. Fast winds from this Wolf-Rayet star create the bubble-shaped nebula as they sweep up slower moving material from an earlier phase of evolution. The windblown nebula has an age of about 70,000 years. Relatively faint emission captured by narrowband filters in the deep image is dominated by the glow of ionized oxygen atoms mapped to a blue hue. Presenting a mostly harmless outline, SH2-308 is also known as The Dolphin-head Nebula.","sh2-308, dolphin, head, blown, massive, star, cosmic, bubble, huge, cataloged, sharpless, 2-308, light-year, well-trained, constellation, canis, major, cover, full, moon, corresponds, diameter, estimated, distance, created, wolf-rayet, bright, center, nebula, time, mass, thought, brief, pre-supernova, phase, evolution, create, bubble-shaped, sweep, slower, moving, material, year, faint, emission, captured, filter, deep, image, dominated, glow, ionized, oxygen, atom, mapped, blue, presenting, harmless, outline, known, dolphin-head"
Pandora's Cluster of Galaxies,"This deep field mosaicked image presents a stunning view of galaxy cluster Abell 2744 recorded by the James Webb Space Telescope's NIRCam. Also dubbed Pandora's Cluster, Abell 2744 itself appears to be a ponderous merger of three different massive galaxy clusters. It lies some 3.5 billion light-years away, toward the constellation Sculptor. Dominated by dark matter, the mega-cluster warps and distorts the fabric of spacetime, gravitationally lensing even more distant objects. Redder than the Pandora cluster galaxies many of the lensed sources are very distant galaxies in the early Universe, their lensed images stretched and distorted into arcs. Of course distinctive diffraction spikes mark foreground Milky Way stars. At the Pandora Cluster's estimated distance this cosmic box spans about 6 million light-years. But don't panic.

How to Identify that Light in the Sky,"What is that light in the sky? The answer to one of humanity's more common questions may emerge from a few quick observations.  For example -- is it moving or blinking? If so, and if you live near a city, the answer is typically an airplane, since planes are so numerous and so few stars and satellites are bright enough to be seen over the glare of artificial city lights. If not, and if you live far from a city, that bright light is likely a planet such as Venus or Mars -- the former of which is constrained to appear near the horizon just before dawn or after dusk.  Sometimes the low apparent motion of a distant airplane near the horizon makes it hard to tell from a bright planet, but even this can usually be discerned by the plane's motion over a few minutes. Still unsure?   The featured chart gives a sometimes-humorous but mostly-accurate assessment.  Dedicated sky enthusiasts will likely note -- and are encouraged to provide -- polite corrections.

Sh2-132: The Lion Nebula,"Is the Lion Nebula the real ruler of the constellation Cepheus?  This powerful feline appearing nebula is powered by two massive stars, each with a mass over 20 times greater than our Sun.  Formed from shells of ionized gas that have expanded, the nebula's energetic matter not only glows, but is dense enough to contract gravitationally and form stars.  The angular size of the Lion Nebula, officially named Sh2-132,  is slightly greater than that of the full moon.  The gaseous iconic region resides about 10,000 light years away in a constellation named after the King of Aethopia in Greek mythology.

Colorful Stars and Clouds near Rho Ophiuchi,"Why is the sky near Antares and Rho Ophiuchi so colorful, yet dusty?  The colors result from a mixture of objects and processes.  Fine dust -- illuminated by starlight -- produces blue reflection nebulae. Gaseous clouds whose atoms are excited by ultraviolet starlight produce reddish emission nebulae. Backlit dust clouds block starlight and so appear dark.   Antares, a red supergiant and one of the brighter stars in the night sky, lights up the yellow-red clouds on the upper right of the featured image. The Rho Ophiuchi star system lies at the center of the blue reflection nebula on the left, while a different reflection nebula, IC 4605, lies just below and right of the image center.  These star clouds are even more colorful than humans can see, emitting light across the electromagnetic spectrum.

Aurora over Karkonosze Mountains,"It was the first time ever. At least, the first time this photographer had ever seen aurora from his home mountains.  And what a spectacular aurora it was. The Karkonosze Mountains in Poland are usually too far south to see any auroras.  But on the amazing night of May 10 - 11, purple and green colors lit up much of the night sky, a surprising spectacle that  also appeared over many mid-latitude locations around the Earth.  The featured image is a composite of six vertical exposures taken during the auroral peak. The futuristic buildings on the right are part of a meteorological observatory located on the highest peak of the Karkonosze Mountains.  The purple color is primarily due to Sun-triggered, high-energy electrons impacting nitrogen molecules in Earth's atmosphere.  Our Sun is reaching its maximum surface activity over the next two years, and although many more auroras are predicted, most will occur over regions closer to the Earth's poles.","karkonosze, mountain, first, time, least, photographer, seen, aurora, home, spectacular, poland, south, amazing, night, purple, green, color, surprising, spectacle, appeared, many, mid-latitude, location, earth, featured, image, composite, vertical, exposure, taken, auroral, peak, futuristic, building, right, part, meteorological, observatory, located, highest, sun-triggered, high-energy, electron, impacting, nitrogen, molecule, atmosphere, reaching, maximum, surface, activity, year, predicted, occur, region, pole"
Messier 66 Close Up,"Big, beautiful spiral galaxy Messier 66 lies a mere 35 million light-years away. The gorgeous island universe is about 100 thousand light-years across, similar in size to the Milky Way. This Hubble Space Telescope close-up view spans a region about 30,000 light-years wide around the galactic core. It shows the galaxy's disk dramatically inclined to our line-of-sight. Surrounding its bright core, the likely home of a supermassive black hole, obscuring dust lanes and young, blue star clusters sweep along spiral arms dotted with the tell-tale glow of pinkish star forming regions.

RCW 85,"From the 1960 astronomical catalog of Rodgers, Campbell and Whiteoak, emission region RCW 85 shines in southern night skies between bright stars Alpha and Beta Centauri. About 5,000 light years distant, the hazy interstellar cloud of glowing hydrogen gas and dust is faint. But detailed structures along well-defined rims within RCW 85 are traced in this cosmic skyscape composed of 28 hours of narrow and broadband exposures. Suggestive of dramatic shapes in other stellar nurseries where natal clouds of gas and dust are sculpted by energetic winds and radiation from newborn stars, the tantalizing nebula has been called the Devil's Tower.

Prominences and Filaments on the Active Sun,"This colorized and digitally sharpened image of the Sun is composed of frames recording emission from hydrogen atoms in the solar chromosphere on May 15. Approaching the maximum of solar cycle 25, a multitude of planet-dwarfing active regions and twisting, snake-like solar filaments are seen to sprawl across the surface of the active Sun.  Suspended in the active regions' strong magnetic fields, the filaments of plasma lofted beyond the Sun's edge appear as bright solar prominences. The large prominences seen near 4 o'clock, and just before 9 o'clock around the solar limb are post flare loops from two powerful X-class solar flares that both occurred on that day. In fact, the 4 o'clock prominence is associated with the monster active region AR 3664 just rotating off the Sun's edge.","prominence, filament, active, colorized, sharpened, image, composed, frame, recording, emission, hydrogen, solar, chromosphere, approaching, maximum, cycle, multitude, planet-dwarfing, region, twisting, snake-like, seen, sprawl, surface, suspended, strong, magnetic, field, plasma, lofted, edge, appear, bright, large, o'clock, limb, post, flare, loop, powerful, x-class, occurred, fact, associated, rotating"
Animation: Black Hole Destroys Star,"What happens if a star gets too close to a black hole? The black hole can rip it apart -- but how? It's not the high gravitational attraction itself that's the problem -- it's the difference in gravitational pull across the star that creates the destruction.  In the featured animated video illustrating this disintegration, you first see a star approaching the black hole.  Increasing in orbital speed, the star's outer atmosphere is ripped away during closest approach.  Much of the star's atmosphere disperses into deep space, but some continues to orbit the black hole and forms an accretion disk. The animation then takes you into the accretion disk while looking toward the black hole. Including the strange visual effects of gravitational lensing, you can even see the far side of the disk.  Finally, you look along one of the jets being expelled along the spin axis.  Theoretical models indicate that these jets not only expel energetic gas, but also create energetic neutrinos -- one of which may have been seen recently on Earth.

Ou4: The Giant Squid Nebula,"Squids on Earth aren't this big.  This mysterious squid-like cosmic cloud spans nearly three full moons on planet Earth's sky. Discovered in 2011 by French astro-imager Nicolas Outters, the Squid Nebula's bipolar shape is distinguished here by the telltale blue emission from doubly ionized oxygen atoms. Though apparently surrounded by the reddish hydrogen emission region Sh2-129, the true distance and nature of the Squid Nebula have been difficult to determine. Still, one investigation suggests Ou4 really does lie within Sh2-129 some 2,300 light-years away. Consistent with that scenario, the cosmic squid would represent a spectacular outflow of material driven by a triple system of hot, massive stars, cataloged as HR8119, seen near the center of the nebula. If so, this truly giant squid nebula would physically be over 50 light-years across.","giant, squid, nebula, earth, mysterious, squid-like, cosmic, cloud, span, full, moon, planet, discovered, french, astro-imager, nicolas, outters, bipolar, shape, distinguished, telltale, blue, emission, ionized, oxygen, atom, surrounded, reddish, hydrogen, region, sh2-129, true, distance, nature, difficult, determine, investigation, suggests, light-year, consistent, scenario, represent, spectacular, material, driven, triple, system, massive, star, cataloged, hr8119, seen, center"
Gigantic Jets over Himalayan Mountains,"Yes, but can your thunderstorm do this? Pictured here are gigantic jets shooting up from a thunderstorm last week toward the Himalayan Mountains in China and Bhutan. The composite image captured four long jets that occurred only minutes apart. Gigantic jets, documented only in this century, are a type of lightning discharge that occurs between some thunderstorms and the Earth's ionosphere high above them.  They are an unusual type of lightning that is much different from regular cloud-to-cloud and cloud-to-ground lightning. The bottoms of gigantic jets appear similar to a  cloud-to-above strike called blue jets, while the tops appear similar to upper-atmosphere red sprites. Although the mechanism and trigger that cause gigantic jets remains a topic of research, it is clear that the jets reduce charge imbalance between different parts of Earth's atmosphere.  A good way to look for gigantic jets is to watch a powerful but distant thunderstorm from a clear location.","gigantic, himalayan, mountain, thunderstorm, pictured, shooting, last, week, china, composite, image, captured, long, occurred, minute, documented, century, type, lightning, discharge, occurs, earth, ionosphere, high, unusual, much, different, regular, cloud-to-cloud, cloud-to-ground, bottom, similar, cloud-to-above, strike, called, blue, appear, upper-atmosphere, sprite, mechanism, trigger, cause, remains, topic, research, clear, reduce, charge, imbalance, part, good, look, watch, powerful, distant, location"
NGC 6188: Dragons of Ara,"Do dragons fight on the altar of the sky?  Although it might appear that way, these dragons are illusions made of thin gas and dust. The emission nebula NGC 6188, home to the glowing clouds, is found about 4,000 light years away near the edge of a large molecular cloud, unseen at visible wavelengths, in the southern constellation Ara (the Altar). Massive, young stars of the embedded Ara OB1 association were formed in that region only a few million years ago, sculpting the dark shapes and powering the nebular glow with stellar winds and intense ultraviolet radiation. The recent star formation itself was likely triggered by winds and supernova explosions from previous generations of massive stars, that swept up and compressed the molecular gas. This impressively detailed image spans over 2 degrees (four full Moons), corresponding to over 150 light years at the estimated distance of NGC 6188.","dragon, fight, altar, appear, illusion, made, thin, dust, emission, nebula, home, glowing, cloud, found, light, year, edge, large, molecular, unseen, visible, wavelength, southern, constellation, massive, young, star, embedded, association, formed, region, sculpting, dark, shape, powering, nebular, glow, stellar, wind, intense, ultraviolet, radiation, recent, formation, triggered, supernova, explosion, previous, generation, swept, compressed, detailed, image, span, degree, full, moon, corresponding, estimated, distance"
Sandy and the Moon Halo,"Last April's Full Moon shines through high clouds near the horizon, casting shadows in this garden-at-night skyscape. Along with canine sentinel Sandy watching the garden gate, the wide-angle snapshot also captured the bright Moon's 22 degree ice halo. But June's bright Full Moon will cast shadows too. This month, the Moon's exact full phase occurs at 01:08 UTC June 22. That's a mere 28 hours or so after today's June solstice (at 20:51 UTC June 20), the moment when the Sun reaches its maximum northern declination. Known to some as a Strawberry Moon, June's Full Moon is at its southernmost declination, and of course will create its own 22 degree halos in hazy night skies.","sandy, moon, halo, last, april, full, shine, high, cloud, horizon, casting, shadow, garden-at-night, skyscape, canine, sentinel, watching, garden, gate, wide-angle, snapshot, captured, bright, degree, june, cast, month, exact, phase, occurs, mere, hour, today, solstice, moment, reach, maximum, northern, declination, known, strawberry, southernmost, course, create, hazy, night"
Hubble's NGC 1546,"Returning to science operations on June 14, the Hubble Space Telescope used its new pointing mode to capture this sharp image of spiral galaxy NGC 1546. A member of the Dorado galaxy group, the island universe lies a mere 50 million light-years away. The galactic disk of NGC 1546 is tilted to our line-of-sight, with the yellowish light of the old stars and bluish regions of newly formed stars shining through the galaxy's dust lanes. More distant background galaxies are scattered throughout this Hubble view. Launched in 1990, Hubble has been exploring the cosmos for more than three decades, recently celebrating its 34th anniversary.","hubble, returning, science, operation, june, space, telescope, used, pointing, mode, capture, sharp, image, spiral, galaxy, member, dorado, group, island, universe, light-year, galactic, disk, tilted, line-of-sight, yellowish, light, star, bluish, region, formed, shining, dust, lane, distant, background, scattered, view, launched, exploring, cosmos, decade, celebrating, anniversary"

About 1,000 light-years away and drifting above the plane of our Milky Way galaxy, LDN 1251 is also less appetizingly known as ""The Rotten Fish Nebula."" The dusty molecular cloud is part of a complex of dark nebulae mapped toward the Cepheus flare region. Across the spectrum, astronomical explorations of the obscuring interstellar clouds reveal energetic shocks and outflows associated with newborn stars, including the telltale reddish glow from scattered Herbig-Haro objects hiding in the image.

The Colors of Saturn from Cassini,"What creates Saturn's colors?  The featured picture of Saturn only slightly exaggerates what a human would see if hovering close to the giant ringed world.   The image was taken in 2005 by the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Here Saturn's majestic rings appear directly only as a curved line, appearing brown, in part from its infrared glow.  The rings best show their complex structure in the dark shadows they create across the upper part of the planet.   The northern hemisphere of Saturn can appear partly blue for the same reason that Earth's skies can appear blue -- molecules in the cloudless portions of both planet's atmospheres are better at scattering blue light than red.  When looking deep into Saturn's clouds, however, the natural gold hue of Saturn's clouds becomes dominant.   It is not known why southern Saturn does not show the same blue hue -- one hypothesis holds that clouds are higher there.   It is also not known why some of Saturn's clouds are colored gold.","color, saturn, cassini, creates, featured, picture, exaggerates, human, hovering, close, giant, ringed, world, image, taken, robot, spacecraft, orbited, majestic, ring, appear, curved, line, appearing, brown, part, infrared, glow, best, show, complex, structure, dark, shadow, create, upper, planet, northern, blue, reason, earth, molecule, cloudless, portion, atmosphere, scattering, light, looking, deep, cloud, natural, gold, becomes, dominant, known, southern, hypothesis, hold, higher, colored"
JADES-GS-z14-0: A New Farthest Object,"What if we could see back to the beginning of the universe?  We could see galaxies forming.  But what did galaxies look like back then?  These questions took a step forward recently with the release of the analysis of a James Webb Space Telescope (JWST) image that included the most distant object yet discovered.  Most galaxies formed at about 3 billion years after the Big Bang, but some formed earlier. Pictured in the inset box is JADES-GS-z14-0, a faint smudge of a galaxy that formed only 300 million years after the universe started.

The Dark Doodad Nebula,"What is that strange brown ribbon on the sky?  When observing the star cluster NGC 4372, observers frequently take note of an unusual dark streak nearby running about three degrees in length. The streak, actually a long molecular cloud, has become known as the Dark Doodad Nebula.  (Doodad is slang for a thingy or a whatchamacallit.)  Pictured here, the Dark Doodad Nebula sweeps across the center of a rich and colorful starfield.  Its dark color comes from a high concentration of interstellar dust that preferentially scatters visible light.  The globular star cluster NGC 4372 is visible as the fuzzy white spot on the far left, while the bright blue star gamma Muscae is seen to the cluster's upper right. The Dark Doodad Nebula can be found with strong binoculars toward the southern constellation of the Fly (Musca).","dark, doodad, nebula, strange, brown, ribbon, observing, star, cluster, observer, take, note, unusual, streak, nearby, running, degree, length, molecular, cloud, become, known, slang, thingy, whatchamacallit, pictured, sweep, center, rich, colorful, starfield, color, come, high, concentration, interstellar, dust, visible, light, globular, fuzzy, white, spot, left, bright, blue, gamma, muscae, seen, upper, right, found, strong, binoculars, southern, constellation, musca"
"Timelapse: Aurora, SAR, and the Milky Way","What's happening in the sky this unusual night? Most striking in the featured 4.5-hour 360-degree panoramic video, perhaps, is the pink and purple aurora. That's because this night, encompassing May 11, was famous for its auroral skies around the world. As the night progresses, auroral bands shimmer, the central band of our Milky Way Galaxy rises, and stars shift as the Earth rotates beneath them.  Captured here simultaneously is a rare red band running above the aurora: a SAR arc, seen to change only slightly. The flashing below the horizon is caused by passing cars, while the moving spots in the sky are satellites and airplanes.  The featured video was captured from Xinjiang, China with four separate cameras.","timelapse, aurora, milky, happening, unusual, night, striking, featured, 4.5-hour, 360-degree, panoramic, video, pink, purple, encompassing, famous, auroral, world, progress, band, shimmer, central, galaxy, rise, star, shift, earth, rotates, captured, rare, running, seen, change, flashing, horizon, caused, passing, moving, spot, satellite, airplane, xinjiang, china, separate, camera"
Protostellar Outflows in Serpens,"Jets of material blasting from newborn stars, are captured in this James Webb Space Telescope close-up of the Serpens Nebula. The powerful protostellar outflows are bipolar, twin jets spewing in opposite directions. Their directions are perpendicular to accretion disks formed around the spinning, collapsing stellar infants. In the NIRcam image, the reddish color represents emission from molecular hydrogen and carbon monoxide produced as the jets collide with the surrounding gas and dust. The sharp image shows for the first time that individual outflows detected in the Serpens Nebula are generally aligned along the same direction. That result was expected, but has only now come into clear view with Webb's detailed exploration of the active young star-forming region. Brighter foreground stars exhibit Webb's characteristic diffraction spikes. At the Serpens Nebula's estimated distance of 1,300 light-years, this cosmic close-up frame is about 1 light-year across.","protostellar, outflow, serpens, material, blasting, newborn, star, captured, james, webb, space, telescope, close-up, powerful, bipolar, twin, spewing, opposite, direction, perpendicular, accretion, disk, formed, spinning, collapsing, stellar, infant, nircam, image, reddish, color, represents, emission, molecular, hydrogen, carbon, monoxide, produced, collide, surrounding, dust, sharp, show, first, time, individual, detected, aligned, result, expected, come, clear, view, detailed, exploration, active, young, star-forming, region, brighter, foreground, exhibit, characteristic, diffraction, spike, nebula, estimated, distance, light-year, cosmic, frame"
Comet 13P/Olbers,"Not a paradox, Comet 13P/Olbers is returning to the inner Solar System after 68 years. The periodic, Halley-type comet will reach its next perihelion or closest approach to the Sun on June 30 and has become a target for binocular viewing low in planet Earth's northern hemisphere night skies. But this sharp telescopic image of 13P is composed of stacked exposures made on the night of June 25. It easily reveals shifting details in the bright comet's torn and tattered ion tail buffeted by the wind from an active Sun, along with a broad, fanned-out dust tail and slightly greenish coma.

A Solstice Moon,"Rising opposite the setting Sun, June's Full Moon occurred within about 28 hours of the solstice. The Moon stays close to the Sun's path along the ecliptic plane and so while the solstice Sun climbed high in daytime skies, June's Full Moon remained low that night as seen from northern latitudes. In fact, the Full Moon hugs the horizon in this June 21 rooftop night sky view from Bursa, Turkey, constructed from exposures made every 10 minutes between moonrise and moonset. In 2024 the Moon also reached a major lunar standstill, an extreme in the monthly north-south range of moonrise and moonset caused by the precession of the Moon's orbit over an 18.6 year cycle. As a result, this June solstice Full Moon was at its southernmost moonrise and moonset along the horizon.","solstice, moon, rising, opposite, setting, june, full, occurred, hour, stay, path, ecliptic, plane, climbed, high, daytime, remained, night, seen, northern, latitude, fact, horizon, rooftop, view, turkey, constructed, exposure, made, minute, moonrise, moonset, reached, major, lunar, standstill, extreme, monthly, north-south, range, caused, precession, orbit, year, cycle, result, southernmost"
Earthrise: A Video Reconstruction,"About 12 seconds into this video, something unusual happens. The Earth begins to rise.  Never seen by humans before, the rise of the Earth over the limb of the Moon occurred about 55.5 years ago and surprised and amazed the crew of Apollo 8. The crew immediately scrambled to take still images of the stunning vista caused by Apollo 8's orbit around the Moon. The featured video is a modern reconstruction of the event as it would have looked were it recorded with a modern movie camera. The colorful orb of our Earth stood out as a familiar icon rising above a distant and unfamiliar moonscape, the whole scene the conceptual reverse of a more familiar moonrise as seen from Earth. To many, the scene also spoke about the unity of humanity: that big blue marble -- that's us -- we all live there. The two-minute video is not time-lapse -- this is the real speed of the Earth rising through the windows of Apollo 8. Seven months and three missions later, Apollo 11 astronauts would not only circle Earth's moon, but land on it.

Time Spiral,"What's happened since the universe started? The time spiral shown here features a few notable highlights. At the spiral's center is the Big Bang, the place where time, as we know it, began about 13.8 billion years ago. Within a few billion years atoms formed, then stars formed from atoms, galaxies formed from stars and gas, our Sun formed, soon followed by our Earth, about 4.6 billion years ago.  Life on Earth begins about 3.8 billion years ago, followed by cells, then photosynthesis within a billion years.  About 1.7 billion years ago, multicellular life on Earth began to flourish.  Fish began to swim about 500 million years ago, and mammals began walking on land about 200 million years ago. Humans first appeared only about 6 million years ago, and made the first cities only about 10,000 years ago.  The time spiral illustrated stops there, but human spaceflight might be added, which started only 75 years ago, and useful artificial intelligence began to take hold within only the past few years.

NGC 602: Oyster Star Cluster,"The clouds may look like an oyster, and the stars like pearls, but look beyond. Near the outskirts of the Small Magellanic Cloud, a satellite galaxy some 200 thousand light-years distant, lies this 5 million year old star cluster NGC 602. Surrounded by its birth shell of gas and dust, star cluster NGC 602 is featured in this stunning Hubble image, augmented in a rollover by images in the X-ray by the Chandra Observatory and in the infrared by Spitzer Telescope. Fantastic ridges and swept back gas strongly suggest that energetic radiation and shock waves from NGC 602's massive young stars have eroded the dusty material and triggered a progression of star formation moving away from the star cluster's center. At the estimated distance of the Small Magellanic Cloud, the featured picture spans about 200 light-years, but a tantalizing assortment of background galaxies are also visible in this sharp view. The background galaxies are hundreds of millions of light-years -- or more -- beyond NGC 602.","oyster, star, cluster, cloud, look, pearl, small, magellanic, satellite, galaxy, light-year, distant, year, surrounded, birth, shell, dust, featured, stunning, hubble, image, augmented, rollover, x-ray, chandra, observatory, infrared, spitzer, telescope, fantastic, ridge, swept, suggest, energetic, radiation, shock, wave, massive, young, eroded, dusty, material, triggered, progression, formation, moving, center, estimated, distance, picture, span, tantalizing, assortment, background, visible, sharp, view"
M83: Star Streams and a Thousand Rubies,"Big, bright, and beautiful, spiral galaxy M83 lies a mere twelve million light-years away, near the southeastern tip of the very long constellation Hydra. About 40,000 light-years across, M83 is known as the Southern Pinwheel for its pronounced spiral arms. But the wealth of reddish star forming regions found near the edges of the arms' thick dust lanes, also suggest another popular moniker for M83, the Thousand-Ruby Galaxy. This new deep telescopic digital image also records the bright galaxy's faint, extended halo. Arcing toward the bottom of the cosmic frame lies a stellar tidal stream, debris drawn from massive M83 by the gravitational disruption of a smaller, merging satellite galaxy. Astronomers David Malin and Brian Hadley found the elusive star stream in the mid 1990s by enhancing photographic plates.","star, stream, ruby, bright, beautiful, spiral, galaxy, mere, light-year, southeastern, long, constellation, hydra, known, southern, pinwheel, pronounced, wealth, reddish, forming, region, found, edge, thick, dust, lane, suggest, popular, moniker, thousand-ruby, deep, telescopic, digital, image, record, faint, extended, halo, arcing, bottom, cosmic, frame, stellar, tidal, debris, drawn, massive, gravitational, disruption, smaller, merging, satellite, astronomer, david, malin, brian, hadley, elusive, enhancing, photographic, plate"
A Beautiful Trifid,"The beautiful Trifid Nebula is a cosmic study in contrasts. Also known as M20, it lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. But the red emission region, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its popular name. Pillars and jets sculpted by newborn stars, above and right of the emission nebula's center, appear in famous Hubble Space Telescope close-up images of the region. The Trifid Nebula is about 40 light-years across. Too faint to be seen by the unaided eye, it almost covers the area of a full moon on planet Earth's sky.","beautiful, trifid, nebula, cosmic, study, contrast, known, light-year, rich, constellation, sagittarius, star, forming, region, plane, galaxy, illustrate, different, astronomical, emission, dominated, light, hydrogen, atom, blue, reflection, produced, dust, reflecting, starlight, dark, dense, cloud, appear, silhouette, separated, part, obscuring, lane, lends, popular, name, pillar, sculpted, newborn, right, center, famous, hubble, space, telescope, close-up, image, faint, seen, unaided, cover, area, full, moon, planet, earth"
Mount Etna Milky Way,"A glow from the summit of Mount Etna, famous active stratovolcano of planet Earth, stands out along the horizon in this mountain and night skyscape. Bands of diffuse light from congeries of innumerable stars along the Milky Way galaxy stretch across the sky above. In silhouette, the Milky Way's massive dust clouds are clumped along the galactic plane. Also familiar to northern skygazers are bright stars Deneb, Vega, and Altair, the Summer Triangle straddling dark nebulae and luminous star clouds poised over the volcanic peak. The deep combined exposures reveal the light of active star forming regions along the Milky Way, echoing Etna's ruddy hue in the northern hemisphere summer's night.","mount, etna, milky, glow, summit, famous, active, stratovolcano, planet, earth, stand, horizon, mountain, night, skyscape, band, diffuse, light, congeries, innumerable, star, galaxy, stretch, silhouette, massive, dust, cloud, clumped, galactic, plane, familiar, northern, skygazers, bright, deneb, vega, altair, summer, straddling, dark, luminous, poised, volcanic, peak, deep, combined, exposure, reveal, forming, region, echoing, ruddy"
NGC 7789: Caroline's Rose,"Found among the rich starfields of the Milky Way, star cluster NGC 7789 lies about 8,000 light-years away toward the constellation Cassiopeia. A late 18th century deep sky discovery of astronomer Caroline Lucretia Herschel, the cluster is also known as Caroline's Rose. Its visual appearance in small telescopes, created by the cluster's complex of stars and voids, is suggestive of nested rose petals. Now estimated to be 1.6 billion years young, the galactic or open cluster of stars also shows its age. All the stars in the cluster were likely born at the same time, but the brighter and more massive ones have more rapidly exhausted the hydrogen fuel in their cores. These have evolved from main sequence stars like the Sun into the many red giant stars shown with a yellowish cast in this color composite. Using measured color and brightness, astronomers can model the mass and hence the age of the cluster stars just starting to ""turn off"" the main sequence and become red giants. Over 50 light-years across, Caroline's Rose spans about half a degree (the angular size of the Moon) near the center of the sharp telescopic image.","caroline, rose, found, rich, starfields, milky, star, cluster, light-year, constellation, cassiopeia, 18th, century, deep, discovery, astronomer, lucretia, herschel, known, visual, appearance, small, telescope, created, complex, void, suggestive, nested, petal, estimated, year, young, galactic, open, show, likely, born, time, massive, exhausted, hydrogen, fuel, core, evolved, main, sequence, many, giant, shown, yellowish, cast, color, composite, using, measured, brightness, model, mass, hence, starting, turn, become, span, half, degree, angular, size, moon, center, sharp, telescopic, image"
Iridescent Clouds over Sweden,"Why are these clouds multi-colored?  A relatively rare phenomenon in clouds known as iridescence can bring up unusual colors vividly -- or even a whole spectrum of colors simultaneously. These polar stratospheric clouds also, known as nacreous and mother-of-pearl clouds,  are formed of small water droplets of nearly uniform size. When the Sun is in the right position and, typically, hidden from direct view, these thin clouds can be seen significantly diffracting sunlight in a nearly coherent manner, with different colors being deflected by different amounts. Therefore, different colors will come to the observer from slightly different directions. Many clouds start with uniform regions that could show iridescence but quickly become too thick, too mixed, or too angularly far from the Sun to exhibit striking colors. The featured image and an accompanying video were taken late in 2019 over Ostersund, Sweden.","iridescent, cloud, sweden, multi-colored, rare, phenomenon, known, iridescence, bring, unusual, color, whole, spectrum, polar, stratospheric, nacreous, mother-of-pearl, formed, small, water, droplet, uniform, size, right, position, hidden, direct, view, thin, seen, diffracting, sunlight, coherent, manner, different, deflected, amount, come, direction, many, start, region, show, become, thick, mixed, exhibit, striking, featured, image, accompanying, taken, late"
Exoplanet Zoo: Other Stars,"Do other stars have planets like our Sun? Surely they do, and evidence includes slight star wobbles created by the gravity of orbiting exoplanets and slight star dimmings caused by orbiting planets moving in front. In all, there have now been over 5,500 exoplanets discovered, including thousands by NASA's space-based Kepler and TESS missions, and over 100 by ESO's ground-based HARPS instrument.  Featured here is an illustrated guess as to what some of these exoplanets might look like. Neptune-type planets occupy the middle and are colored blue because of blue-scattering atmospheric methane they might contain. On the sides of the illustration, Jupiter-type planets are shown, colored tan and red from the scatterings of atmospheric gases that likely include small amounts of carbon.  Interspersed are many Earth-type rocky planets of many colors. As more exoplanets are discovered and investigated, humanity is developing a better understanding of how common Earth-like planets are, and how common life might be in the universe.","exoplanet, star, planet, evidence, includes, slight, wobble, created, gravity, orbiting, exoplanets, dimmings, caused, moving, front, discovered, including, thousand, nasa, space-based, kepler, tess, mission, ground-based, harp, instrument, featured, illustrated, guess, look, neptune-type, occupy, middle, colored, blue, blue-scattering, atmospheric, methane, contain, side, illustration, jupiter-type, shown, scattering, likely, include, small, amount, carbon, interspersed, many, earth-type, rocky, color, investigated, humanity, developing, better, understanding, common, earth-like, life, universe"
Noctilucent Clouds over Florida,"These clouds are doubly unusual. First, they are rare noctilucent clouds, meaning that they are visible at night -- but only just before sunrise or just after sunset.  Second, the source of these noctilucent clouds is actually known. In this rare case, the source of the sunlight-reflecting ice-crystals in the upper atmosphere can be traced back to the launch of a nearby SpaceX rocket about 30 minutes earlier.  Known more formally as polar mesospheric clouds, the vertex of these icy wisps happens to converge just in front of a rising crescent Moon. The featured image -- and accompanying video -- were captured over Orlando, Florida, USA about a week ago.  The bright spot to the right of the Moon is the planet Jupiter, while the dotted lights above the horizon on the right are from an airplane.","noctilucent, cloud, florida, unusual, first, rare, meaning, visible, night, sunrise, sunset, second, source, known, case, sunlight-reflecting, ice-crystals, atmosphere, traced, launch, spacex, rocket, minute, polar, mesospheric, vertex, wisp, happens, converge, front, rising, crescent, moon, featured, image, accompanying, video, captured, orlando, week, bright, spot, planet, jupiter, dotted, light, horizon, airplane"
A Sagittarius Triplet,"These three bright nebulae are often featured on telescopic tours of the constellation Sagittarius and the crowded starfields of the central Milky Way. In fact, 18th century cosmic tourist Charles Messier cataloged two of them; M8, the large nebula above center, and colorful M20 below and left in the frame. The third emission region includes NGC 6559, right of M8 and separated from the larger nebula by a dark dust lane. All three are stellar nurseries about five thousand light-years or so distant. Over a hundred light-years across the expansive M8 is also known as the Lagoon Nebula. M20's popular moniker is the Trifid. Glowing hydrogen gas creates the dominant red color of the emission nebulae. But for striking contrast, blue hues in the Trifid are due to dust reflected starlight. The broad interstellar skyscape spans almost 4 degrees or 8 full moons on the sky.","sagittarius, triplet, bright, featured, telescopic, tour, constellation, crowded, starfields, central, milky, fact, 18th, century, cosmic, tourist, charles, cataloged, large, center, colorful, left, frame, third, emission, region, includes, right, separated, larger, nebula, dark, dust, lane, stellar, thousand, light-year, distant, hundred, expansive, known, lagoon, popular, moniker, trifid, glowing, hydrogen, creates, dominant, color, striking, contrast, blue, reflected, starlight, broad, interstellar, skyscape, span, degree, full, moon"
Globular Cluster Omega Centauri,"Globular star cluster Omega Centauri packs about 10 million stars much older than the Sun into a volume some 150 light-years in diameter. Also known as NGC 5139, at a distance of 15,000 light-years it's the largest and brightest of 200 or so known globular clusters that roam the halo of our Milky Way galaxy. Though most star clusters consist of stars with the same age and composition, the enigmatic Omega Cen exhibits the presence of different stellar populations with a spread of ages and chemical abundances. In fact, Omega Cen may be the remnant core of a small galaxy merging with the Milky Way. With a yellowish hue, Omega Centauri's red giant stars are easy to pick out in this sharp telescopic view. A two-decade-long exploration of the dense star cluster with the Hubble Space Telescope has revealed evidence for a massive black hole near the center of Omega Centauri.","globular, cluster, omega, centauri, star, pack, much, older, volume, light-year, diameter, known, distance, largest, brightest, roam, halo, milky, galaxy, consist, composition, enigmatic, exhibit, presence, different, stellar, population, spread, chemical, abundance, fact, remnant, core, small, merging, yellowish, giant, easy, pick, sharp, telescopic, view, two-decade-long, exploration, dense, hubble, space, telescope, revealed, evidence, massive, black, hole, center"
Jones-Emberson 1,"Planetary nebula Jones-Emberson 1 is the death shroud of a dying Sun-like star. It lies some 1,600 light-years from Earth toward the sharp-eyed constellation Lynx. About 4 light-years across, the expanding remnant of the dying star's atmosphere was shrugged off into interstellar space, as the star's central supply of hydrogen and then helium for fusion was depleted after billions of years. Visible near the center of the planetary nebula is what remains of the stellar core, a blue-hot white dwarf star.  Also known as PK 164 +31.1, the nebula is faint and very difficult to glimpse at a telescope's eyepiece. But this deep image combining over 12 hours of exposure time does show it off in exceptional detail. Stars within our own Milky Way galaxy as well as background galaxies across the universe are scattered through the clear field of view. Ephemeral on the cosmic stage, Jones-Emberson 1 will fade away over the next few thousand years. Its hot, central white dwarf star will take billions of years to cool.","jones-emberson, planetary, death, shroud, dying, sun-like, star, light-year, earth, sharp-eyed, constellation, lynx, expanding, remnant, atmosphere, shrugged, interstellar, space, central, supply, hydrogen, helium, fusion, depleted, year, visible, center, nebula, remains, stellar, core, blue-hot, white, dwarf, known, +31.1, faint, difficult, glimpse, telescope, eyepiece, deep, image, combining, hour, exposure, time, show, exceptional, detail, milky, galaxy, universe, scattered, clear, field, view, ephemeral, cosmic, stage, fade, next, take, cool"
Solar System Family Portrait,"In 1990, cruising four billion miles from the Sun, the Voyager 1 spacecraft looked back to make this first ever Solar System family portrait. The complete portrait is a 60 frame mosaic made from a vantage point 32 degrees above the ecliptic plane. In it, Voyager's wide-angle camera frames sweep through the inner Solar System at the left, linking up with ice giant Neptune, the Solar System's outermost planet, at the far right. Positions for Venus, Earth, Jupiter, Saturn, Uranus, and Neptune are indicated by letters, while the Sun is the bright spot near the center of the circle of frames. The inset frames for each of the planets are from Voyager's narrow-field camera. Unseen in the portrait are Mercury, too close to the Sun to be detected, and Mars, unfortunately hidden by sunlight scattered in the camera's optical system. Closer to the Sun than Neptune at the time, small, faint Pluto's position was not covered.

Meteor Misses Galaxy,"The galaxy was never in danger. For one thing, the Triangulum galaxy (M33), pictured, is much bigger than the tiny grain of rock at the head of the meteor. For another, the galaxy is much farther away -- in this instance 3 million light years as opposed to only about 0.0003 light seconds.  Even so, the meteor's path took it angularly below the galaxy. Also the wind high in Earth's atmosphere blew the meteor's glowing evaporative molecule train away from the galaxy, in angular projection.  Still, the astrophotographer was quite lucky to capture both a meteor and a galaxy in a single exposure -- which was subsequently added to two other images of M33 to bring up the spiral galaxy's colors.  At the end, the meteor was gone in a second, but the galaxy will last billions of years.   Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

The Tadpole Galaxy from Hubble,"Why does this galaxy have such a long tail?  In this stunning vista, based on image data from the Hubble Legacy Archive, distant galaxies form a dramatic backdrop for disrupted spiral galaxy Arp 188, the Tadpole Galaxy. The cosmic tadpole is a mere 420 million light-years distant toward the northern constellation of the Dragon (Draco). Its eye-catching tail is about 280 thousand light-years long and features massive, bright blue star clusters. One story goes that a more compact intruder galaxy crossed in front of Arp 188 - from right to left in this view - and was slung around behind the Tadpole by their gravitational attraction. During the close encounter, tidal forces drew out the spiral galaxy's stars, gas, and dust forming the spectacular tail. The intruder galaxy itself, estimated to lie about 300 thousand light-years behind the Tadpole, can be seen through foreground spiral arms at the upper right. Following its terrestrial namesake, the Tadpole Galaxy will likely lose its tail as it grows older, the tail's star clusters forming smaller satellites of the large spiral galaxy.

Cometary Globules,"What are these unusual interstellar structures? Bright-rimmed, flowing shapes gather near the center of this rich starfield toward the borders of the nautical southern constellations Pupis and Vela. Composed of interstellar gas and dust, the grouping of light-year sized cometary globules is about 1300 light-years distant. Energetic ultraviolet light from nearby hot stars has molded the globules and ionized their bright rims. The globules also stream away from the Vela supernova remnant which may have influenced their swept-back shapes. Within them, cores of cold gas and dust are likely collapsing to form low mass stars, whose formation will ultimately cause the globules to disperse. In fact, cometary globule CG 30 (on the upper left) sports a small reddish glow near its head, a telltale sign of energetic jets from a star in the early stages of formation.","cometary, globule, unusual, interstellar, structure, bright-rimmed, flowing, shape, gather, center, rich, starfield, border, nautical, southern, constellation, pupis, vela, composed, dust, grouping, light-year, sized, distant, energetic, ultraviolet, light, star, molded, ionized, bright, stream, supernova, remnant, influenced, swept-back, core, cold, likely, collapsing, form, mass, formation, cause, disperse, fact, upper, left, sport, small, reddish, glow, head, telltale, sign, early, stage"
Villarrica Volcano Against the Sky,"When Vulcan, the Roman god of fire, swings his blacksmith's hammer, the sky is lit on fire. A recent eruption of Chile's Villarrica volcano shows the delicate interplay between this fire -- actually glowing steam and ash from melted rock -- and the light from distant stars in our Milky Way galaxy and the Magellanic Clouds galaxies. In the featured timelapse video, the Earth rotates under the stars as Villarrica erupts.  With about 1350 volcanoes, our planet Earth rivals Jupiter's moon Io as the most geologically active place in the Solar System. While both have magnificent beauty, the reasons for the existence of volcanoes on both worlds are different. Earth's volcanoes typically occur between slowly shifting outer shell plates, while Io's volcanoes are caused by gravitational flexing resulting from Jupiter's tidal gravitational pull.","villarrica, volcano, vulcan, roman, fire, swing, blacksmith, hammer, recent, eruption, chile, show, delicate, interplay, glowing, steam, melted, rock, light, distant, star, milky, galaxy, magellanic, cloud, featured, timelapse, video, earth, rotates, erupts, planet, rival, jupiter, moon, active, place, solar, system, magnificent, beauty, reason, existence, world, different, occur, shifting, outer, shell, plate, caused, gravitational, flexing, resulting, tidal, pull"
Messier 24: Sagittarius Star Cloud,"Unlike most entries in Charles Messier's famous catalog of deep sky objects, M24 is not a bright galaxy, star cluster, or nebula. It's a gap in nearby, obscuring interstellar dust clouds that allows a view of the distant stars in the Sagittarius spiral arm of our Milky Way galaxy. Direct your gaze through this gap with binoculars or small telescope and you are looking through a window over 300 light-years wide at stars some 10,000 light-years or more from Earth. Sometimes called the Small Sagittarius Star Cloud, M24's luminous stars are left of center in this gorgeous starscape.

Anticrepuscular Rays at the Planet Festival,"For some, these subtle bands of light and shadow stretched across the sky as the Sun set on July 11. Known as anticrepuscular rays, the bands are formed as a large cloud bank near the western horizon cast long shadows through the atmosphere at sunset. Due to the camera's perspective, the bands of light and shadow seem to converge toward the eastern (opposite) horizon at a point seen just above a 14th century hilltop castle in Brno, Czech Republic. In the foreground, denizens of planet Earth are enjoying the region's annual Planet Festival in the park below the Brno Observatory and Planetarium. And while crepuscular and anticrepuscular rays are a relatively common atmospheric phenomenon, this festival's 10 meter diameter inflatable spheres representing bodies of the Solar System are less often seen on planet Earth.","anticrepuscular, planet, festival, subtle, band, light, stretched, known, formed, large, cloud, bank, western, horizon, cast, long, shadow, sunset, camera, perspective, seem, converge, eastern, opposite, point, seen, 14th, century, hilltop, castle, brno, czech, republic, foreground, denizen, earth, enjoying, region, annual, park, observatory, planetarium, crepuscular, common, atmospheric, phenomenon, meter, diameter, inflatable, representing, body, solar, system"
Apollo 11 Landing Panorama,"Have you seen a panorama from another world lately? Assembled from high-resolution scans of the original film frames, this one sweeps across the magnificent desolation of the Apollo 11 landing site on the Moon's Sea of Tranquility. The images were taken 55 years ago by Neil Armstrong looking out his window on the Eagle Lunar Module shortly after the July 20, 1969 landing. The frame at the far left (AS11-37-5449) is the first picture taken by a person on another world. Thruster nozzles can be seen in the foreground on the left (toward the south), while at the right (west), the shadow of the Eagle is visible. For scale, the large, shallow crater on the right has a diameter of about 12 meters. Frames taken from the Lunar Module windows about an hour and a half after landing, before walking on the lunar surface, were intended to document the landing site in case an early departure was necessary.","landing, panorama, seen, world, assembled, high-resolution, scan, original, film, frame, sweep, magnificent, desolation, apollo, site, moon, tranquility, image, taken, year, armstrong, looking, window, eagle, lunar, module, left, as11-37-5449, first, picture, person, thruster, nozzle, foreground, south, right, west, shadow, visible, scale, large, shallow, crater, meter, hour, half, walking, surface, intended, document, case, early, departure, necessary"
King of Wings Hoodoo under the Milky Way,"This rock structure is not only surreal -- it's real.  Perhaps the reason it's not more famous is that it is smaller than one might guess: the capstone rock overhangs only a few meters.  Even so, the King of Wings outcrop, located in New Mexico, USA, is a fascinating example of an unusual type of rock structure called a hoodoo. Hoodoos may form when a layer of hard rock overlays a layer of eroding softer rock. Figuring out the details of incorporating this hoodoo into a night-sky photoshoot took over a year. Besides waiting for a suitably picturesque night behind a sky with few clouds, the foreground had to be artificially lit just right relative to the natural glow of the background.  After much planning and waiting, the final shot, featured here, was taken in May 2016. Mimicking the horizontal bar, the background sky features the band of our Milky Way Galaxy stretching overhead.","king, wing, hoodoo, milky, rock, structure, surreal, real, reason, famous, smaller, guess, capstone, overhang, outcrop, located, mexico, fascinating, example, unusual, type, called, form, layer, hard, overlay, eroding, softer, figuring, detail, incorporating, night-sky, photoshoot, took, year, waiting, picturesque, night, cloud, foreground, relative, natural, glow, background, planning, final, shot, featured, taken, mimicking, horizontal, feature, band, galaxy, stretching, overhead"
Chamaeleon Dark Nebulas,"Sometimes the dark dust of interstellar space has an angular elegance.  Such is the case toward the far-south constellation of Chamaeleon. Normally too faint to see, dark dust is best known for blocking visible light from stars and galaxies behind it. In this 36.6-hour exposure, however, the dust is seen mostly in light of its own, with its strong red and near-infrared colors creating a brown hue. Contrastingly blue, the bright star Beta Chamaeleontis is visible on the upper right, with the dust that surrounds it preferentially reflecting blue light from its primarily blue-white color.  All of the pictured stars and dust occur in our own Milky Way Galaxy with one notable exception: the white spot just below Beta Chamaeleontis is the galaxy IC 3104 which lies far in the distance.  Interstellar dust is mostly created in the cool atmospheres of giant stars and dispersed into space by stellar light, stellar winds, and stellar explosions such as supernovas.","chamaeleon, dark, nebula, dust, interstellar, space, angular, elegance, case, far-south, constellation, faint, best, known, blocking, visible, light, star, galaxy, 36.6-hour, exposure, seen, strong, near-infrared, color, creating, brown, blue, bright, beta, chamaeleontis, upper, right, surround, reflecting, blue-white, pictured, occur, milky, notable, exception, white, spot, distance, created, cool, giant, dispersed, stellar, explosion, supernova"
The Crab Nebula from Visible to X-Ray,"What powers the Crab Nebula? A city-sized magnetized neutron star spinning around 30 times a second. Known as the Crab Pulsar, it is the bright spot in the center of the gaseous swirl at the nebula's core.  About 10 light-years across, the spectacular picture of the Crab Nebula (M1) frames a swirling central disk and complex filaments of surrounding and expanding glowing gas. The picture combines visible light from the Hubble Space Telescope in red and blue with X-ray light from the Chandra X-ray Observatory shown in white, and diffuse X-ray emission detected by Imaging X-ray Polarimetry Explorer (IXPE) in diffuse purple.  The central pulsar powers the Crab Nebula's emission and expansion by slightly slowing its spin rate, which drives out a wind of energetic electrons.

Exaggerated Moon,"Our Moon doesn't really have craters this big.  Earth's Moon, Luna, also doesn't naturally show this spikey texture, and its colors are more subtle. But this digital creation is based on reality.  The featured image is a digital composite of a good Moon image and surface height data taken from NASA's Lunar Orbiter Laser Altimeter (LOLA) mission -- and then exaggerated for educational understanding.  The digital enhancements, for example, accentuate lunar highlands and show more clearly craters that illustrate the tremendous bombardment our Moon has been through during its 4.6-billion-year history.  The dark areas, called maria, have fewer craters and were once seas of molten lava. Additionally, the image colors, although based on the moon's real composition, are changed and exaggerated.  Here, a blue hue indicates a region that is iron rich, while orange indicates a slight excess of aluminum.  Although the Moon has shown the same side to the Earth for billions of years, modern technology is allowing humanity to learn much more about it -- and how it affects the Earth.","exaggerated, moon, crater, earth, luna, show, spikey, texture, color, subtle, digital, creation, based, reality, featured, image, composite, good, surface, height, data, taken, nasa, lunar, orbiter, laser, altimeter, lola, mission, educational, understanding, enhancement, example, accentuate, highland, illustrate, tremendous, bombardment, 4.6-billion-year, history, dark, area, called, maria, fewer, lava, real, composition, changed, blue, indicates, region, iron, rich, orange, slight, aluminum, shown, side, year, modern, technology, allowing, humanity, much, affect"
NGC 7023: The Iris Nebula,"These cosmic clouds have blossomed 1,300 light-years away in the fertile starfields of the constellation Cepheus. Called the Iris Nebula, NGC 7023 is not the only nebula to evoke the imagery of flowers. Still, this deep telescopic image shows off the Iris Nebula's range of colors and symmetries embedded in surrounding fields of interstellar dust. Within the Iris itself, dusty nebular material surrounds a hot, young star. The dominant color of the brighter reflection nebula is blue, characteristic of dust grains reflecting starlight. Central filaments of the reflection nebula glow with a faint reddish photoluminescence as some dust grains effectively convert the star's invisible ultraviolet radiation to visible red light. Infrared observations indicate that this nebula contains complex carbon molecules known as PAHs. The dusty blue petals of the Iris Nebula span about six light-years.","iris, nebula, cosmic, cloud, blossomed, light-year, fertile, starfields, constellation, cepheus, called, evoke, imagery, flower, deep, telescopic, image, show, range, color, symmetry, embedded, surrounding, field, interstellar, dust, dusty, nebular, material, surround, young, star, dominant, brighter, reflection, blue, characteristic, grain, reflecting, starlight, central, filament, glow, faint, reddish, photoluminescence, convert, invisible, ultraviolet, radiation, visible, light, infrared, observation, indicate, contains, complex, carbon, molecule, known, pahs, petal, span"
Facing NGC 6946,"From our vantage point in the Milky Way Galaxy, we see NGC 6946 face-on. The big, beautiful spiral galaxy is located just 20 million light-years away, behind a veil of foreground dust and stars in the high and far-off constellation Cepheus. In this sharp telescopic portrait, from the core outward the galaxy's colors change from the yellowish light of old stars in the center to young blue star clusters and reddish star forming regions along the loose, fragmented spiral arms. NGC 6946 is also bright in infrared light and rich in gas and dust, exhibiting a high star birth and death rate. In fact, since the early 20th century ten confirmed supernovae, the death explosions of massive stars, were discovered in NGC 6946. Nearly 40,000 light-years across, NGC 6946 is also known as the Fireworks Galaxy.","facing, vantage, point, milky, galaxy, face-on, beautiful, spiral, located, light-year, veil, foreground, dust, star, high, far-off, constellation, cepheus, sharp, telescopic, portrait, core, outward, color, change, yellowish, light, center, young, blue, cluster, reddish, forming, region, fragmented, bright, infrared, rich, exhibiting, death, rate, fact, 20th, century, confirmed, supernova, explosion, massive, discovered, known, firework"
Saturn at the Moon's Edge,"Saturn now rises before midnight in planet Earth's sky. On July 24, the naked-eye planet was in close conjunction, close on the sky, to a waning gibbous Moon. But from some locations on planet Earth the ringed gas giant was occulted, disappearing behind the Moon for about an hour from skies over parts of Asia and Africa. Because the Moon and bright planets wander through the sky near the ecliptic plane, such occultation events are not uncommon, but they can be dramatic. In this telescopic view from Nanjing, Jiangsu, China, Saturn is caught moments before its disappearance behind the lunar disk. The snapshot gives the illusion that Saturn hangs just above Glushko crater, a 43 kilometer diameter, young, ray crater near the Moon's western edge. Of course, the Moon is 400 thousand kilometers away, compared to Saturn's distance of 1.4 billion kilometers.","saturn, moon, edge, rise, midnight, planet, earth, july, naked-eye, close, conjunction, waning, gibbous, location, ringed, giant, occulted, disappearing, hour, part, asia, africa, bright, wander, ecliptic, plane, occultation, event, uncommon, dramatic, telescopic, view, nanjing, jiangsu, china, caught, moment, disappearance, lunar, disk, snapshot, give, illusion, hang, glushko, crater, kilometer, diameter, young, western, course, thousand, compared, distance"
Sun Dance,"Sometimes, the surface of our Sun seems to dance. In the middle of 2012, for example, NASA's Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamic Observatory spacecraft imaged an impressive prominence that seemed to perform a running dive roll like an acrobatic dancer.  The dramatic explosion was captured in ultraviolet light in the featured time-lapse video covering about three hours. A looping magnetic field directed the flow of hot plasma on the Sun. The scale of the   dancing prominence is huge -- the entire Earth would easily fit under the flowing   arch of hot gas.  A quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month and may erupt in a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME), expelling hot gas into the Solar System.  The energy mechanism that creates a solar prominence is still a topic of research.  Like in 2012, this year the Sun's surface is again quite active and features many filaments and prominences.","dance, surface, seems, middle, example, nasa, sun-orbiting, solar, dynamic, observatory, spacecraft, imaged, impressive, prominence, seemed, perform, running, dive, roll, acrobatic, dancer, dramatic, explosion, captured, ultraviolet, light, featured, time-lapse, video, covering, hour, looping, magnetic, field, directed, flow, plasma, scale, dancing, huge, entire, earth, flowing, arch, quiescent, last, month, erupt, coronal, mass, ejection, expelling, system, energy, mechanism, creates, topic, research, year, active, feature, many, filament"
Milky Way over Uluru,"What's happening above Uluru?  A United Nations World Heritage Site, Uluru  is an extraordinary 350-meter high mountain in central Australia that rises sharply from nearly flat surroundings. Composed of sandstone, Uluru has slowly formed over the past 300 million years as softer rock eroded away.  The Uluru region has been a home to humans for over 22,000 years. Recorded  last month, the starry sky above Uluru includes the central band of our Milky Way galaxy, complete with complex dark filaments of dust, bright red emission nebulas, and billions of stars.","milky, uluru, happening, united, nation, world, heritage, site, extraordinary, 350-meter, high, mountain, central, australia, rise, flat, surroundings, composed, sandstone, formed, past, year, softer, rock, eroded, region, home, human, recorded, last, month, starry, includes, band, galaxy, complete, complex, dark, filament, dust, bright, emission, star"
Arp 142: Interacting Galaxies from Webb,"To some, it looks like a penguin. But to people who study the universe, it is an interesting example of two big galaxies interacting. Just a few hundred million years ago, the upper NGC 2936 was likely a normal spiral galaxy: spinning, creating stars, and minding its own business.  Then it got too close to the massive elliptical galaxy NGC 2937, below, and took a dive.  Together known as Arp 142, they are featured in this new Webb infrared image, while a visible light Hubble image appears in comparison.  NGC 2936 is not only being deflected, but distorted, by this close gravitational interaction.  When massive galaxies pass near each other, gas is typically condensed from which new stars form.  A young group of stars appears as the nose of the penguin toward the right of the upper galaxy, while in the center of the spiral, bright stars together appear as an eye.  Before a billion years, the two galaxies will likely merge into one larger galaxy.

Leopard Spots on Martian Rocks,"What is creating these unusual spots? Light-colored spots on Martian rocks, each surrounded by a dark border, were discovered earlier this month by NASA's Perseverance Rover currently exploring Mars.  Dubbed leopard spots because of their seemingly similarity to markings on famous Earth-bound predators, these curious patterns are being studied with the possibility they were created by ancient Martian life.  The pictured spots measure only millimeters across and were discovered on a larger rock named Cheyava Falls.  The exciting but unproven speculation is that long ago, microbes generated energy with chemical reactions that turned rock from red to white while leaving a dark ring, like some similarly appearing spots on Earth rocks. Although other non-biological explanations may ultimately prevail, speculation focusing on this potential biological origin is causing much intrigue.

Comet Olbers over Kunetice Castle,"A visitor to the inner solar system every 70 years or so, Comet 13P/Olbers reached its most recent perihelion, or closest approach to the Sun, on June 30. Now on a return voyage to the distant Oort Cloud, the Halley-type comet is recorded here sweeping through northern summer night skies over historic Kunetice Castle, Czech Republic. The composite of tracked exposures for comet and sky, showing the comet's broad dust tail, brighter coma, and long ion tail buffeted by storms and winds from the Sun, and fixed exposures for foreground landscape was recorded on July 28. The comet is about 16 light-minutes beyond the castle and seen against faint background stars below the northern constellation Ursa Major. The hilltop castle dates to the 15th century, while Heinrich Olbers discovered the comet in 1815. Captured here low in northwestern skies just after sunset Comet Olbers, for now, offers skywatchers on planet Earth rewarding telescopic and binocular views.

Mars Passing By,"As Mars wanders through Earth's night, it passes about 5 degrees south of the Pleiades star cluster in this composite astrophoto. The skyview was constructed from a series of images captured over a run of 16 consecutive clear nights beginning on July 12. Mars' march across the field of view begins at the far right, the planet's ruddy hue showing a nice contrast with the blue Pleiades stars. Moving much faster across the sky against the distant stars, the fourth planet from the Sun easily passes seventh planet Uranus. Red planet Mars and the ice giant world were in close conjunction, about 1/2 degree apart, on July 16. Continuing its rapid eastward trek, Mars has now left the sister stars and outer planet behind though, passing north of red giant star Aldebaran. Mars will come within about 1/3 degree of Jupiter in planet Earth's sky on August 14.","passing, wanders, earth, night, pass, degree, south, pleiades, star, cluster, composite, astrophoto, skyview, constructed, series, image, captured, consecutive, clear, beginning, march, field, view, begin, right, planet, ruddy, showing, nice, contrast, blue, moving, much, distant, fourth, seventh, uranus, giant, world, close, conjunction, july, continuing, rapid, trek, left, sister, outer, north, aldebaran, come, jupiter, august"
Glory and Fog Bow,"On a road trip up Mount Uludağ in Bursa province, Turkey these motorcyclists found themselves above low clouds and fog in late June. With the bright Sun directly behind them, the view down the side of the great mountain revealed a beautiful, atmospheric glory and fog bow. Known to some as the heiligenschein or the Specter of the Brocken, a glory can also sometimes be seen from airplanes or even high buildings. It often appears to be a dark giant surrounded by a bright halo. Of course the dark giant is just the shadow of the observer (90MB video) cast opposite the Sun. The clouds and fog are composed of very small water droplets, smaller than rain drops, that refract and reflect sunlight to create the glory's colorful halo and this more extensive fog bow.","glory, road, trip, mount, uludağ, bursa, province, turkey, motorcyclist, found, cloud, late, june, bright, view, side, great, mountain, revealed, beautiful, atmospheric, known, heiligenschein, specter, brocken, seen, airplane, high, building, appears, dark, giant, surrounded, halo, course, shadow, video, cast, opposite, composed, small, water, droplet, smaller, rain, drop, refract, reflect, sunlight, create, colorful, extensive"
Gaia: Here Comes the Sun,"What would it look like to return home from outside our galaxy? Although designed to answer greater questions, data from ESA's robotic Gaia mission is helping to provide a uniquely modern perspective on humanity's place in the universe.  Gaia orbits the Sun near the Earth and resolves stars' positions so precisely that it can determine a slight shift from its changing vantage point over the course of a year, a shift that is proportionately smaller for more distant stars -- and so determines distance.  In the first sequence of the video, an illustration of the Milky Way is shown that soon resolves into a three-dimensional visualization of Gaia star data.  A few notable stars are labelled with their common names, while others stars are labelled with numbers from a Gaia catalog. Eventually, the viewer arrives in our stellar neighborhood where many stars were tracked by Gaia, and soon at our home star Sol, the Sun. At the video's end, the reflective glow of Sol's third planet becomes visible: Earth.","gaia, come, look, return, home, galaxy, designed, answer, greater, question, data, robotic, mission, helping, provide, modern, perspective, humanity, place, universe, orbit, earth, resolve, star, position, determine, slight, shift, changing, vantage, point, course, year, smaller, distant, determines, distance, sequence, video, illustration, shown, three-dimensional, visualization, notable, labelled, common, name, others, number, catalog, viewer, arrives, stellar, neighborhood, many, tracked, reflective, glow, third, planet, becomes, visible"
Milky Way Over Tunisia,"That's no moon. On the ground, that's the Lars Homestead in Tunisia. And that's not just any galaxy. That's the central band of our own Milky Way galaxy. Last, that's not just any meteor. It is a bright fireball likely from last year's Perseids meteor shower. The featured image composite combines consecutive exposures taken by the same camera from the same location.

Storm Cloud Over Texas,"What makes this storm cloud so colorful?  First, the cloud itself is composed of millions of tiny droplets of water and ice.  Its bottom is almost completely flat -- but this isn't unusual.  Bottom flatness in clouds is generally caused by air temperature dropping as you go up, and that above a specific height, water-saturated air condenses out water droplets.  The shape of the cloud middle is caused by a water-droplet-laden column of air being blown upward.  Most unusual, though, are the orange and yellow colors.  Both colors are caused by the cloud's water drops reflecting sunlight. The orange color in the cloud's middle and bottom sections are reflections of a nearly red sunset.  In contrast, the yellow color of the cloud's top results from reflection of light from a not-yet-setting Sun, where some -- but less -- blue light is being scattered away. Appearing to float above the plains in Texas, the featured impressive image of a dynamic cumulonimbus cloud was captured in 2021 while investigating a tornado.","storm, cloud, texas, make, colorful, composed, tiny, droplet, water, bottom, flat, unusual, flatness, caused, temperature, dropping, specific, height, water-saturated, condenses, shape, middle, water-droplet-laden, column, blown, upward, orange, yellow, color, drop, reflecting, sunlight, section, reflection, sunset, contrast, result, light, not-yet-setting, blue, scattered, appearing, float, plain, featured, impressive, image, dynamic, cumulonimbus, captured, investigating, tornado"
Milky Way Behind Three Merlons,"To some, they look like battlements, here protecting us against the center of the Milky Way. The Three Merlons, also called the Three Peaks of Lavaredo, stand tall today because they are made of dense dolomite rock which has better resisted erosion than surrounding softer rock. They formed about 250 million years ago and so are comparable in age with one of the great extinctions of life on Earth. A leading hypothesis is that this great extinction was triggered by an asteroid about 10-km across, larger in size than Mount Everest, impacting the Earth. Humans have gazed up at the stars in the Milky Way and beyond for centuries, making these battlefield-like formations, based in the Sexten Dolomites, a popular place for current and ancient astronomers.","milky, merlon, look, battlement, protecting, center, called, peak, lavaredo, stand, tall, today, made, dense, dolomite, rock, resisted, erosion, surrounding, softer, formed, year, comparable, great, extinction, life, earth, leading, hypothesis, triggered, asteroid, 10-km, larger, size, mount, everest, impacting, human, gazed, star, century, making, battlefield-like, formation, based, sexten, popular, place, current, ancient, astronomer"
Periodic Comet Swift-Tuttle,"A Halley-type comet with an orbital period of about 133 years, Comet 109P/Swift-Tuttle is recognized as the parent of the annual Perseid Meteor Shower. The comet's last visit to the inner Solar System was in 1992. Then, it did not become easily visible to the naked eye, but it did become bright enough to see from most locations with binoculars and small telescopes. This stunning color image of Swift-Tuttle's greenish coma, long ion tail and dust tail was recorded using film on November 24, 1992. That was about 16 days after the large periodic comet's closest approach to Earth. Comet Swift-Tuttle is expected to next make an impressive appearance in night skies in 2126. Meanwhile, dusty cometary debris left along the orbit of Swift-Tuttle will continue to be swept up creating planet Earth's best-known July and August meteor shower.","periodic, comet, swift-tuttle, halley-type, orbital, period, year, 109p/swift-tuttle, recognized, parent, annual, perseid, meteor, shower, last, visit, inner, solar, system, become, visible, naked, bright, location, binoculars, small, telescope, stunning, color, image, greenish, coma, long, tail, dust, recorded, using, film, large, closest, approach, earth, expected, next, make, impressive, appearance, night, dusty, cometary, debris, left, along, orbit, continue, swept, creating, planet, best-known, july, august"
A Perseid Below,"Denizens of planet Earth typically watch meteor showers by looking up. But this remarkable view, captured on August 13, 2011 by astronaut Ron Garan, caught a Perseid meteor by looking down. From Garan's perspective on board the International Space Station orbiting at an altitude of about 380 kilometers, the Perseid meteors streak below, swept up dust from comet Swift-Tuttle. The vaporizing comet dust grains are traveling at about 60 kilometers per second through the denser atmosphere around 100 kilometers above Earth's surface. In this case, the foreshortened meteor flash is near frame center, below the curving limb of the Earth and a layer of greenish airglow, just below bright star Arcturus. Want to look up at a meteor shower?  You're in luck, as the 2024 Perseid meteor shower is active now and predicted to peak near August 12. With interfering bright moonlight absent, this year you'll likely see many Perseid meteors under clear, dark skies after midnight.","perseid, denizen, planet, earth, watch, meteor, shower, looking, remarkable, view, captured, astronaut, garan, caught, perspective, board, international, space, station, orbiting, altitude, kilometer, streak, swept, dust, comet, swift-tuttle, vaporizing, grain, traveling, second, denser, surface, case, foreshortened, flash, frame, center, curving, limb, layer, greenish, airglow, bright, star, arcturus, want, look, luck, active, predicted, peak, august, interfering, moonlight, absent, year, many, clear, dark, midnight"
"The Light, Dark, and Dusty Trifid","Messier 20, popularly known as the Trifid Nebula, lies about 5,000 light-years away toward the nebula rich constellation Sagittarius. A star forming region in the plane of our galaxy, the Trifid does illustrate three different types of astronomical nebulae; red emission nebulae dominated by light from hydrogen atoms, blue reflection nebulae produced by dust reflecting starlight, and dark nebulae where dense dust clouds appear in silhouette. The reddish emission region, roughly separated into three parts by obscuring dust lanes, is what lends the Trifid its popular name. The cosmic cloud complex is over 40 light-years across and would cover the area of a full moon on planet Earth's sky. But the Trifid Nebula is too faint to be seen by the unaided eye. Over 75 hours of image data captured under dark night skies was used to create this stunning telescopic view.

Animation: Perseid Meteor Shower,"Where do Perseid meteors come from? Mostly small bits of stony grit, Perseid meteoroids were once expelled from Comet Swift-Tuttle and continue to follow this comet's orbit as they slowly disperse.  The featured animation depicts the entire meteoroid stream as it orbits our Sun.  When the Earth nears this stream, as it does every year, the Perseid Meteor Shower occurs.  Highlighted as bright in the animation, comet debris this size is usually so dim it is practically undetectable.  Only a small fraction of this debris will enter the Earth's atmosphere, heat up and disintegrate brightly.  Tonight and the next few nights promise some of the better skies to view the Perseid shower as well as other active showers because the first quarter moon will be absent from the sky from midnight onward.

Perseid Meteors over Stonehenge,"What's happening in the sky above Stonehenge? A meteor shower: specifically, the Perseid meteor shower. A few nights ago, after the sky darkened, many images of meteors from this year's Perseids were captured separately and merged into a single frame. Although the meteors all traveled on straight paths, these paths appear slightly curved by the wide-angle lens of the capturing camera. The meteor streaks can all be traced back to a single point on the sky called the radiant, here just off the top of the frame in the constellation of Perseus. The same camera took a deep image of the background sky that brought up the central band of our Milky Way galaxy running nearly vertical through the image center. The featured image was taken from Wiltshire, England, being careful to include, at the bottom, the famous astronomical monument of Stonehenge. Although the Perseids peaked last night, some Perseid meteors should still be visible for a few more nights.","perseid, meteor, stonehenge, happening, shower, night, darkened, many, image, year, perseids, captured, merged, single, frame, traveled, straight, path, appear, curved, wide-angle, lens, capturing, camera, streak, traced, point, called, radiant, constellation, perseus, took, deep, background, brought, central, band, milky, galaxy, running, vertical, center, featured, taken, wiltshire, england, careful, include, bottom, famous, astronomical, monument, peaked, last, visible"
Giant Jet from the International Space Station,"What's that on the horizon? When circling the Earth on the International Space Station early last month, astronaut Matthew Dominick saw an unusual type of lightning just beyond the Earth's edge: a gigantic jet. The powerful jet appears on the left of the featured image in red and blue. Giant jet lightning has only been known about for the past 23 years. The atmospheric jets are associated with thunderstorms and extend upwards towards Earth's ionosphere.  The lower part of the frame shows the Earth at night, with Earth's thin atmosphere tinted green from airglow. City lights are visible, sometimes resolved, but usually creating diffuse white glows in intervening clouds.  The top of the frame reveals distant stars in the dark night sky. The nature of gigantic jets and their possible association with other types of Transient Luminous Events (TLEs) such as blue jets and red sprites remains an active topic of research.

Meteors and Aurora over Germany,"This was an unusual night. For one thing, the night sky of August 11 and 12, earlier this week, occurred near the peak of the annual Perseid Meteor Shower. Therefore, meteors streaked across the dark night as small bits cast off from Comet Swift-Tuttle came crashing into the Earth's atmosphere. Even more unusually, for central Germany at least, the night sky glowed purple. The red-blue hue was due to aurora caused by an explosion of particles from the Sun a few days before. This auroral storm was so intense that it was seen as far south as Texas and Italy, in Earth's northern hemisphere.  The featured image composite was built from 7 exposures taken over 26 minutes from Ense, Germany. The Perseids occur predictably every August, but auroras visible this far south are more unusual and less predictable.

Late Night Vallentuna,"Bright Mars and even brighter Jupiter are in close conjunction just above the pine trees in this post-midnight skyscape from Vallentuna, Sweden. Taken on August 12 during a geomagnetic storm, the snapshot records the glow of aurora borealis or northern lights, beaming from the left side of the frame. Of course on that date Perseid meteors rained through planet Earth's skies, grains of dust from the shower's parent, periodic comet Swift-Tuttle. The meteor streak at the upper right is a Perseid plowing through the atmosphere at about 60 kilometers per second. Also well-known in Earth's night sky, the bright Pleiades star cluster shines below the Perseid meteor streak. In Greek myth, the Pleiades were seven daughters of the astronomical titan Atlas and sea-nymph Pleione. The Pleiades and their parents' names are given to the cluster's nine brightest stars.

Meteor Borealis,"A single exposure made with a camera pointed almost due north on August 12 recorded this bright Perseid meteor in the night sky west of Halifax, Nova Scotia, Canada. The meteor's incandescent trace is fleeting. It appears to cross the stars of the Big Dipper, famous northern asterism and celestial kitchen utensil, while shimmering curtains of aurora borealis, also known as the northern lights, dance in the night. Doubling the wow factor for night skywatchers near the peak of this year's Perseid meteor shower auroral activity on planet Earth was enhanced by geomagnetic storms.

Sky Full of Arcs,"On August 11 a Rocket Lab Electron rocket launched from a rotating planet. With a small satellite on board its mission was dubbed A Sky Full of SARs (Synthetic Aperture Radar satellites), departing for low Earth orbit from Mahia Peninsula on New Zealand's north island. The fiery trace of the Electron's graceful launch arc is toward the east in this southern sea and skyscape, a composite of 50 consecutive frames taken over 2.5 hours. Fixed to a tripod, the camera was pointing directly at the South Celestial Pole, the extension of planet Earth's axis of rotation in to space. But no bright star marks that location in the southern hemisphere's night sky. Still, the South Celestial Pole is easy to spot. It lies at the center of the concentric star trail arcs that fill the skyward field of view.

A Solar Prominence Eruption from SDO,"One of the most spectacular solar sights is an erupting prominence. In 2011, NASA's Sun-orbiting Solar Dynamic Observatory spacecraft imaged an impressively large prominence erupting from the surface. The dramatic explosion was captured in ultraviolet light in the featured time lapse video covering 90 minutes, where a new frame was taken every 24 seconds.  The scale of the prominence is huge -- the entire Earth would easily fit under the flowing  curtain of hot gas.  A solar prominence is channeled and sometimes held above the Sun's surface by the Sun's magnetic field. A quiescent prominence typically lasts about a month and may erupt in a Coronal Mass Ejection (CME) expelling hot gas into the Solar System.  The energy mechanism that creates a solar prominence is a continuing topic of research.  Our Sun is again near solar maximum and so very active, featuring numerous erupting prominences and CMEs, one of which resulted in picturesque auroras just over the past week.","solar, prominence, eruption, spectacular, sight, erupting, nasa, sun-orbiting, dynamic, observatory, spacecraft, imaged, large, surface, dramatic, explosion, captured, ultraviolet, light, featured, time, lapse, video, covering, minute, frame, taken, second, scale, huge, entire, earth, flowing, curtain, channeled, held, magnetic, field, quiescent, last, month, erupt, coronal, mass, ejection, expelling, system, energy, mechanism, creates, continuing, topic, research, maximum, active, featuring, numerous, cmes, resulted, picturesque, aurora, week"
IC 5146: The Cocoon Nebula,"Inside the Cocoon Nebula is a newly developing cluster of stars. Cataloged as IC 5146, the beautiful nebula is nearly 15 light-years wide. Soaring high in northern summer night skies, it's located some 4,000 light years away toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus).  Like other star forming regions, it stands out in red, glowing, hydrogen gas excited by young, hot stars, and dust-reflected starlight at the edge of an otherwise invisible molecular cloud.  In fact, the bright star found near the center of this nebula is likely only a few hundred thousand years old, powering the nebular glow as it clears out a cavity in the molecular cloud's star forming dust and gas. A 48-hour long integration resulted in this exceptionally deep color view tracing tantalizing features within and surrounding the dusty stellar nursery.","cocoon, nebula, developing, cluster, star, cataloged, beautiful, light-year, wide, soaring, high, northern, summer, night, located, light, year, constellation, swan, cygnus, forming, region, stand, glowing, hydrogen, excited, young, dust-reflected, starlight, edge, invisible, molecular, cloud, fact, bright, found, center, powering, nebular, glow, clear, cavity, dust, long, integration, resulted, deep, color, view, tracing, tantalizing, feature, surrounding, dusty, stellar, nursery"
Supermoon Beyond the Temple of Poseidon,"A supermoon occurred yesterday. And tonight's moon should also look impressive.  Supermoons appear slightly larger and brighter than most full moons because they reach their full phase when slightly nearer to the Earth -- closer than 90 percent of all full moons.  This supermoon was also a blue moon given the definition that it is the third of four full moons occurring during a single season.  Blue moons are not usually blue, and a different definition holds that a blue moon is the second full moon that occurs during a single month.  The featured image captured the blue supermoon right near its peak size yesterday as it was rising beyond the Temple of Poseidon in Greece. This supermoon is particularly unusual in that it is the first of four successive supermoons, the next three occurring in September, October, and November.","supermoon, temple, poseidon, occurred, yesterday, tonight, moon, look, impressive, supermoons, appear, larger, brighter, full, reach, phase, nearer, earth, closer, percent, blue, given, definition, third, occurring, single, season, different, hold, second, occurs, month, featured, image, captured, peak, size, rising, greece, unusual, successive, september, october, november"
Fermi's 12-year All-Sky Gamma-ray Map,"Forget X-ray vision — imagine what you could see with gamma-ray vision!  The featured all-sky map shows what the universe looks like to NASA's Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope.  Fermi sees light with energies about a billion times what the human eye can see, and the map combines 12 years of Fermi observations.  The colors represent the brightness of the gamma-ray sources, with brighter sources appearing lighter in color.  The prominent stripe across the middle is the central plane of our Milky Way galaxy.  Most of the red and yellow dots scattered above and below the Milky Way’s plane are very distant galaxies, while most of those within the plane are nearby pulsars.  The blue background that fills the image is the diffuse glow of gamma-rays from distant sources that are too dim to be detected individually.  Some gamma-ray sources remain unidentified and topics of research — currently no one knows what they are.","fermi, 12-year, all-sky, gamma-ray, forget, x-ray, vision, imagine, featured, show, universe, look, nasa, space, telescope, light, energy, time, human, combine, year, observation, color, represent, brightness, source, brighter, appearing, lighter, prominent, stripe, middle, central, plane, milky, galaxy, yellow, scattered, distant, nearby, pulsar, blue, background, fill, image, diffuse, glow, gamma-rays, detected, remain, unidentified, topic, research, know"
The Dark Tower in Scorpius,"In silhouette against a crowded star field along the tail of the arachnological constellation Scorpius, this dusty cosmic cloud evokes for some the image of an ominous dark tower. In fact, monstrous clumps of dust and molecular gas collapsing to form stars may well lurk within the dark nebula, a structure that spans almost 40 light-years across this gorgeous telescopic portrait. A cometary globule, the swept-back cloud is shaped by intense ultraviolet radiation from the OB association of very hot stars in NGC 6231, off the upper right corner of the scene. That energetic ultraviolet light also powers the globule's bordering reddish glow of hydrogen gas. Hot stars embedded in the dust can be seen as bluish reflection nebulae. This dark tower and associated nebulae are about 5,000 light-years away.

Supernova Remnant CTA 1,"There is a quiet pulsar at the heart of CTA 1. The supernova remnant was discovered as a source of emission at radio wavelengths by astronomers in 1960 and since identified as the result of the death explosion of a massive star. But no radio pulses were detected from the expected pulsar, the rotating neutron star remnant of the massive star's collapsed core. Seen about 10,000 years after the initial supernova explosion, the interstellar debris cloud is faint at optical wavelengths. CTA 1's visible wavelength emission from still expanding shock fronts is revealed in this deep telescopic image, a frame that spans about 2 degrees across a starfield in the northern constellation of Cepheus. While no pulsar has since been found at radio wavelengths, in 2008 the Fermi Gamma-ray Space Telescope detected pulsed emission from CTA 1, identifying the supernova remnant's rotating neutron star. The source has been recognized as the first in a growing class of pulsars that are quiet at radio wavelengths but pulse in high-energy gamma-rays.","supernova, remnant, quiet, pulsar, heart, discovered, source, emission, radio, wavelength, astronomer, identified, result, death, explosion, massive, star, detected, expected, rotating, neutron, collapsed, core, seen, year, initial, interstellar, debris, cloud, faint, optical, visible, expanding, shock, front, revealed, deep, telescopic, image, frame, span, degree, starfield, northern, constellation, cepheus, found, fermi, gamma-ray, space, telescope, pulsed, identifying, recognized, growing, class, pulse, high-energy, gamma-rays"
South Pacific Shadowset,"The full Moon and Earth's shadow set together in this island skyscape. The alluring scene was captured Tuesday morning, August 20, from Fiji, South Pacific Ocean, planet Earth. For early morning risers shadowset in the western sky is a daily apparition. Still, the grey-blue shadow is often overlooked in favor of a brighter eastern horizon. Extending through the dense atmosphere, Earth's setting shadow is bounded above by a pinkish glow or anti-twilight arch. Known as the Belt of Venus, the arch's lovely color is due to backscattering of reddened light from the opposite horizon's rising Sun. Of course, the setting Moon's light is reddened by the long sight-line through the atmosphere. But on that date the full Moon could be called a seasonal Blue Moon, the third full Moon in a season with four full Moons. And even though the full Moon is always impressive near the horizon, August's full Moon is considered by some the first of four consecutive full Supermoons in 2024.","pacific, shadowset, full, moon, earth, shadow, island, skyscape, alluring, scene, captured, tuesday, morning, august, fiji, south, ocean, planet, early, riser, western, daily, apparition, grey-blue, overlooked, favor, brighter, eastern, horizon, extending, dense, setting, bounded, pinkish, glow, anti-twilight, arch, known, belt, venus, lovely, color, backscattering, reddened, light, opposite, rising, course, long, sight-line, atmosphere, date, called, seasonal, blue, third, season, impressive, considered, consecutive, supermoons"
Fresh Tiger Stripes on Saturn's Enceladus,"Do underground oceans vent through canyons on Saturn's moon Enceladus?  Long features dubbed tiger stripes are known to be spewing ice from the moon's icy interior into space, creating a cloud of fine ice particles over the moon's South Pole and creating Saturn's mysterious E-ring.  Evidence for this has come from the robot Cassini spacecraft that orbited Saturn from 2004 to 2017.  Pictured here, a high resolution image of Enceladus is shown from a close flyby.  The unusual surface features dubbed tiger stripes are visible in false-color blue.  Why Enceladus is active remains a mystery, as the neighboring moon Mimas, approximately the same size, appears quite dead. An analysis of ejected ice grains has yielded evidence that complex organic molecules exist inside Enceladus. These large carbon-rich molecules bolster -- but do not prove -- that oceans under Enceladus' surface could contain life.

Perseid Meteors Over Inner Mongolia,"Did you see it?  One of the more common questions during a meteor shower occurs because the time it takes for a meteor to flash is similar to the time it takes for a head to turn.  Possibly, though, the glory of seeing bright meteors shoot across the sky -- while knowing that they were once small pebbles on another world -- might make it all worthwhile, even if your observing partner(s) can't always share in your experience. The featured video is composed of short clips taken in Inner Mongolia, China during the 2023 Perseid Meteor Shower. Several bright meteors were captured while live-reaction audio was being recorded -- just as the meteors flashed.  This year's 2024 Perseids also produced many beautiful meteors. Another good meteor shower to watch for is the Geminids which peak yearly in mid-December, this year with relatively little competing glow from a nearly new Moon.

Moon Eclipses Saturn,"What if Saturn disappeared?  Sometimes, it does.  It doesn't really go away, though, it just disappears from view when our Moon moves in front.  Such a Saturnian eclipse, more formally called an occultation, was visible along a long swath of Earth -- from Peru, across the Atlantic Ocean, to Italy -- only a few days ago.  The featured color image is a digital fusion of the clearest images captured during the event and rebalanced for color and relative brightness between the relatively dim Saturn and the comparatively bright Moon. Saturn and the comparative bright Moon.  The exposures were all taken from Breda, Catalonia, Spain, just before occultation. Eclipses of Saturn by our Moon will occur each month for the rest of this year. Each time, though, the fleeting event will be visible only to those with clear skies -- and the right location on Earth.

Tulip Nebula and Black Hole Cygnus X-1,"When can you see a black hole, a tulip, and a swan all at once? At night -- if the timing is right, and if your telescope is pointed in the right direction.  The complex and beautiful Tulip Nebula blossoms about 8,000 light-years away toward the constellation of Cygnus the Swan.  Ultraviolet radiation from young energetic stars at the edge of the Cygnus OB3 association, including O star HDE 227018, ionizes the atoms and powers the emission from the Tulip Nebula.  Stewart Sharpless cataloged this nearly 70 light-years across reddish glowing cloud of interstellar gas and dust in 1959, as Sh2-101. Also in the featured field of view is the black hole Cygnus X-1, which is also a microquasar because it is one of strongest X-ray sources in planet Earth's sky. Blasted by powerful jets from a lurking black hole, its fainter bluish curved shock front is only faintly visible beyond the cosmic Tulip's petals, near the right side of the frame.   Back to School?

Star Factory Messier 17,"A nearby star factory known as Messier 17 lies some 5,500 light-years away in the nebula-rich constellation Sagittarius. At that distance, this 1.5 degree wide field-of-view would span about 150 light-years. In the sharp color composite image faint details of the region's gas and dust clouds are highlighted with narrowband image data against a backdrop of central Milky Way stars. The stellar winds and energetic radiation from hot, massive stars already formed from M17's stock of cosmic gas and dust have slowly carved away at the remaining interstellar material, producing the nebula's cavernous appearance and the undulating shapes within. A popular stop on telescopic tours of the cosmos, M17 is also known as the Omega or the Swan Nebula.","star, factory, nearby, known, light-year, nebula-rich, constellation, sagittarius, distance, degree, wide, field-of-view, span, sharp, color, composite, image, faint, detail, region, dust, cloud, highlighted, narrowband, data, central, milky, stellar, wind, energetic, radiation, massive, formed, stock, cosmic, carved, remaining, interstellar, material, producing, nebula, cavernous, appearance, undulating, shape, popular, stop, telescopic, tour, cosmos, omega, swan"
Southern Moonscape,"The Moon's south pole is toward the top left of this detailed telescopic moonscape. Captured on August 23, it looks across the rugged southern lunar highlands. The view's foreshortened perspective heightens the impression of a dense field of craters and makes the craters themselves appear more oval shaped close to the lunar limb. Prominent near center is 114 kilometer diameter crater Moretus. Moretus is young for a large lunar crater and features terraced inner walls and a 2.1 kilometer high, central peak, similar in appearance to the more northerly young crater Tycho. Mountains visible along the lunar limb at the top can rise about 6 kilometers or so above the surrounding terrain. Close to the lunar south pole, permanently shadowed crater floors with expected reservoirs of water-ice have made the rugged south polar region of the Moon a popular target for exploration.","southern, moonscape, moon, south, pole, left, detailed, telescopic, captured, august, look, rugged, lunar, highland, view, foreshortened, perspective, heightens, impression, dense, field, crater, make, appear, oval, shaped, close, limb, prominent, center, kilometer, diameter, moretus, young, large, feature, terraced, inner, wall, high, central, peak, similar, appearance, tycho, mountain, visible, rise, surrounding, terrain, shadowed, floor, expected, reservoir, water-ice, made, polar, region, popular, target, exploration"
IFN and the NGC 7771 Group,"Galaxies of the NGC 7771 Group are featured in this intriguing skyscape. Some 200 million light-years distant toward the constellation Pegasus, NGC 7771 is the large, edge-on spiral near center, about 75,000 light-years across, with two smaller galaxies below it. Large spiral NGC 7769 is seen face-on to the right. Galaxies of the NGC 7771 group are interacting, making repeated close passages that will ultimately result in galaxy-galaxy mergers on a cosmic timescale. The interactions can be traced by distortions in the shape of the galaxies themselves and faint streams of stars created by their mutual gravitational tides. But a clear view of this galaxy group is difficult to come by as the deep image also reveals extensive clouds of foreground dust sweeping across the field of view. The dim, dusty galactic cirrus clouds are known as Integrated Flux Nebulae. The faint IFN reflect starlight from our own Milky Way Galaxy and lie only a few hundred light-years above the galactic plane.","group, galaxy, featured, intriguing, skyscape, light-year, distant, constellation, pegasus, large, edge-on, spiral, center, smaller, seen, face-on, right, interacting, making, repeated, close, passage, result, galaxy-galaxy, merger, cosmic, timescale, interaction, traced, distortion, shape, faint, stream, star, created, mutual, gravitational, tide, clear, view, difficult, come, deep, image, reveals, extensive, cloud, foreground, dust, sweeping, field, dusty, galactic, cirrus, known, integrated, flux, nebula, reflect, starlight, milky, hundred, plane"
The Moon Dressed Like Saturn,"Why does Saturn appear so big? It doesn't -- what is pictured are foreground clouds on Earth crossing in front of the Moon. The Moon shows a slight crescent phase with most of its surface visible by reflected Earthlight, known as Da Vinci glow. The Sun directly illuminates the brightly lit lunar crescent from the bottom, which means that the Sun must be below the horizon and so the image was taken before sunrise.  This double take-inducing picture was captured on 2019 December 24, two days before the Moon slid in front of the Sun to create a solar eclipse. In the foreground, lights from small Guatemalan towns are visible behind the huge volcano Pacaya.    Your Sky Surprise: What picture did APOD feature on your birthday?

A Triangular Prominence Hovers Over the Sun,"Why is there a triangle hovering over the Sun?  Although the shape is unusual, the type of structure is not: it is part of an evolving solar prominence.  Looping magnetic fields on the Sun channel the flow of energetic particles, sometimes holding glowing gaseous structures aloft for months.  A prominence glows brightly because it contains particularly hot, dense, or opaque solar plasma. The surprising triangular structure occurred last week. Larger than our Earth, the iconic prominence was imaged by several solar photographers and documented by NASA's Solar Dynamic Observatory to form and violently dissipate in about a day. The featured image was captured in a color of red light emitted strongly by hydrogen.  Below, solar fibrils carpet the Sun's chromosphere, while the background sky is so faint in comparison that no stars are visible.

Quarter Moon and Sister Stars,"Nine days ago, two quite different sky icons were imaged rising together. Specifically, Earth's Moon shared the eastern sky with the sister stars of the Pleiades cluster, as viewed from Alberta, Canada.  Astronomical images of the well-known Pleiades often show the star cluster's alluring blue reflection nebulas, but here they are washed-out by the orange moonrise sky. The half-lit Moon, known as a quarter moon, is overexposed, although the outline of the dim lunar night side can be seen by illuminating earthshine, light first reflected from the Earth. The featured image is a composite of eight successive exposures with brightnesses adjusted to match what the human eye would see.  The Moon passes nearly -- or directly -- in front of the Pleaides once a month.","quarter, moon, sister, star, different, icon, imaged, rising, earth, shared, eastern, pleiades, cluster, viewed, canada, astronomical, image, well-known, show, alluring, blue, reflection, washed-out, orange, moonrise, half-lit, known, overexposed, outline, lunar, night, side, seen, illuminating, earthshine, light, reflected, featured, composite, successive, exposure, brightness, adjusted, match, human, pass, front, pleaides, month"
NGC 6995: The Bat Nebula,"Can you see the bat?  It haunts this cosmic close-up of the eastern Veil Nebula.  The Veil Nebula itself is a large supernova remnant, the expanding debris cloud from the death explosion of a massive star. While the Veil is roughly circular in shape and covers nearly 3 degrees on the sky toward the constellation of the Swan (Cygnus), NGC 6995, known informally as the Bat Nebula, spans only 1/2 degree, about the apparent size of the Moon. That translates to 12 light-years at the Veil's estimated distance, a reassuring 1,400 light-years from planet Earth. In the composite of image data recorded through narrow band filters, emission from hydrogen atoms in the remnant is shown in red with strong emission from oxygen atoms shown in hues of blue. Of course, in the western part of the Veil lies another seasonal apparition: the Witch's Broom Nebula.

NGC 247 and Friends,"About 70,000 light-years across, NGC 247 is a spiral galaxy smaller than our Milky Way. Measured to be only 11 million light-years distant it is nearby though. Tilted nearly edge-on as seen from our perspective, it dominates this telescopic field of view toward the southern constellation Cetus. The pronounced void on one side of the galaxy's disk recalls for some its popular name, the Needle's Eye galaxy. Many background galaxies are visible in this sharp galaxy portrait, including the remarkable string of four galaxies just below and left of NGC 247 known as Burbidge's Chain.

Ringed Ice Giant Neptune,"Ringed ice giant Neptune lies near the center of this sharp near-infrared image from the James Webb Space Telescope. The dim and distant world is the farthest planet from the Sun, about 30 times farther away than planet Earth. But in the stunning Webb view, the planet's dark and ghostly appearance is due to atmospheric methane that absorbs infrared light. High altitude clouds that reach above most of Neptune's absorbing methane easily stand out in the image though. Coated with frozen nitrogen, Neptune's largest moon Triton is brighter than Neptune in reflected sunlight, seen at the upper left sporting the Webb telescope's characteristic diffraction spikes. Including Triton, seven of Neptune's 14 known moons can be identified in the field of view. Neptune's faint rings are striking in this space-based planetary portrait.

Small Moon Deimos,"Mars has two tiny moons, Phobos and Deimos, named for the figures in Greek mythology Fear and Panic. Detailed surface views of smaller moon Deimos are shown in both these panels. The images were taken in 2009, by the HiRISE camera on board the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter spacecraft, NASA's long-lived interplanetary internet satellite. The outermost of the two Martian moons, Deimos is one of the smallest known moons in the Solar System, measuring only about 15 kilometers across.  Both Martian moons were discovered in 1877 by Asaph Hall, an American astronomer working at the US Naval Observatory in Washington D.C. But their existence was postulated around 1610 by Johannes Kepler, the astronomer who derived the laws of planetary motion. In this case, Kepler's prediction was not based on scientific principles, but his writings and ideas were so influential that the two Martian moons are discussed in works of fiction such as Jonathan Swift's Gulliver's Travels, written in 1726, over 150 years before their discovery.","small, moon, deimos, tiny, phobos, named, figure, greek, mythology, fear, panic, detailed, surface, view, smaller, shown, panel, image, taken, hirise, camera, board, reconnaissance, orbiter, spacecraft, nasa, long-lived, interplanetary, internet, satellite, outermost, martian, smallest, known, solar, system, measuring, kilometer, discovered, asaph, hall, american, astronomer, working, naval, observatory, washington, d.c., existence, postulated, johannes, kepler, derived, planetary, motion, case, prediction, based, scientific, principle, writing, idea, influential, discussed, work, fiction, jonathan, swift, gulliver, travel, written, year, discovery"
M31: The Andromeda Galaxy,"The most distant object easily visible to the unaided eye is M31, the great Andromeda Galaxy. Even at some two and a half million light-years distant, this immense spiral galaxy -- spanning over 200,000 light years -- is visible, although as a faint, nebulous cloud in the constellation Andromeda. A bright yellow nucleus, dark winding dust lanes, and expansive spiral arms dotted with blue star clusters and red nebulae, are recorded in this stunning telescopic image which combines data from orbiting Hubble with ground-based images from Subaru and Mayall.

Impressively, this image was timed to capture the dark and doomed Martian moon Phobos, visible just left of center.  The surface feature on the lower left, known as Orcus Patera, is unusual for its large size and oblong shape, and mysterious because the processes that created it still remain unknown.  ESA's robotic Mars Express spacecraft was launched in 2003 and, among many notable science discoveries, bolstered evidence that Mars was once home to large bodies of water.","moon, crater, volcano, featured, image, show, form, express, vista, captured, interesting, region, july, picture, famous, feature, olympus, largest, solar, system, visible, upper, right, large, martian, horizon, pavonis, several, circular, impact, seen, surface, named, planet, timed, capture, dark, doomed, phobos, left, center, known, orcus, patera, unusual, size, oblong, shape, mysterious, process, created, remain, unknown, robotic, spacecraft, launched, many, notable, science, discovery, bolstered, evidence, home, body, water"
Horsehead and Orion Nebulas,"The dark Horsehead Nebula and the glowing Orion Nebula are contrasting cosmic vistas. Adrift 1,500 light-years away in one of the night sky's most recognizable constellations, they appear in opposite corners of the above stunning mosaic. The familiar Horsehead nebula appears as a dark cloud, a small silhouette notched against the long glow of hydrogen -- here shown in gold -- at the lower left. Alnitak is the easternmost star in Orion's belt and is seen as the bright star to the left of the Horsehead. Just below Alnitak is the Flame Nebula, with clouds of bright emission and dramatic dark dust lanes. The magnificent emission region, the Orion Nebula (aka M42), lies at the upper right. Immediately to its left is a prominent reflection nebula sometimes called the Running Man. Pervasive tendrils of glowing hydrogen gas are easily traced throughout the region.

A Night Sky over the Tatra Mountains,"A natural border between Slovakia and Poland is the Tatra Mountains. A prominent destination for astrophotographers, the Tatras are the highest mountain range in the Carpathians. In the featured image taken in May, one can see the center of our Milky Way galaxy with two of its famous stellar nurseries, the Lagoon and Omega Nebula, just over the top of the Tatras. Stellar nurseries are full of ionized hydrogen, a fundamental component for the formation of Earth-abundant water. As a fundamental ingredient in all known forms of life, water is a crucial element in the Universe. Such water can be seen in the foreground in the form of the Bialka River.

Young Star Cluster NGC 1333,"This spectacular mosaic of images from the James Webb Space Telescope peers into the heart of young star cluster NGC 1333. A mere 1,000 light-years distant toward the heroic constellation Perseus, the nearby star cluster lies at the edge of the large Perseus molecular cloud. Part of Webb's deep exploration of the region to identify low mass brown dwarf stars and free floating planets, the space telescope's combined field of view spans nearly 2 light-years across the dusty cluster's turbulent stellar nursery. In fact, NGC 1333 is known to harbor stars less than a million years old, though most are hidden from optical telescopes by the pervasive stardust. The chaotic environment may be similar to one in which our own Sun formed over 4.5 billion years ago.","young, star, cluster, spectacular, mosaic, image, james, webb, space, telescope, peer, heart, mere, light-year, distant, heroic, constellation, perseus, nearby, edge, large, molecular, cloud, part, deep, exploration, region, identify, mass, brown, dwarf, free, floating, planet, combined, field, view, span, dusty, turbulent, stellar, nursery, fact, known, harbor, less, year, hidden, optical, pervasive, stardust, chaotic, environment, similar, formed"
Aurora Australis and the International Space Station,"This snapshot from the International Space Station was taken on August 11 while orbiting about 430 kilometers above the Indian Ocean, Southern Hemisphere, planet Earth. The spectacular view looks south and east, down toward the planet's horizon and through red and green curtains of aurora australis. The auroral glow is caused by emission from excited oxygen atoms in the extremely rarefied upper atmosphere still present at the level of the orbiting outpost. Green emission from atomic oxygen dominates this scene at altitudes of 100 to 250 kilometers, while red emission from atomic oxygen can extend as high as 500 kilometers altitude. Beyond the glow of these southern lights, this view from low Earth orbit reveals the starry sky from a southern hemisphere perspective. Stars in Orion's belt and the Orion Nebula are near the Earth's limb just left of center. Sirius, alpha star of Canis Major and brightest star in planet Earth's night is above center along the right edge of the southern orbital skyscape.

The Moona Lisa,"Only natural colors of the Moon in planet Earth's sky appear in this creative visual presentation. Arranged as pixels in a framed image, the lunar disks were photographed at different times. Their varying hues are ultimately due to reflected sunlight affected by changing atmospheric conditions and the alignment geometry of Moon, Earth, and Sun. Here, the darkest lunar disks are the colors of earthshine. A description of earthshine, in terms of sunlight reflected by Earth's oceans illuminating the Moon's dark surface, was written over 500 years ago by Leonardo da Vinci.  But stand farther back from your screen or just shift your gaze to the smaller versions of the image. You might also see one of da Vinci's most famous works of art.

Find the Man in the Moon,"Have you ever seen the Man in the Moon? This common question plays on the ability of humans to see pareidolia -- imagining familiar icons where they don't actually exist. The textured surface of Earth's full Moon is home to numerous identifications of iconic objects, not only in modern western culture but in world folklore throughout history. Examples, typically dependent on the Moon's perceived orientation, include the Woman in the Moon and the Rabbit in the Moon. One facial outline commonly identified as the Man in the Moon starts by imagining the two dark circular areas -- lunar maria -- here just above the Moon's center, to be the eyes.  Surprisingly, there actually is a man in this Moon image -- a close look will reveal a real person -- with a telescope -- silhouetted against the Moon. This well-planned image was taken in 2016 in Cadalso de los Vidrios in Madrid, Spain.

Mercury's Vivaldi Crater from BepiColombo,"Why does this large crater on Mercury have two rings and a smooth floor?  No one is sure.  The unusual feature called Vivaldi Crater spans 215 kilometers and was imaged again in great detail by ESA's and JAXA's robotic BepiColombo spacecraft on a flyby earlier this month. A large circular feature on a rocky planet or moon is usually caused by either an impact by a small asteroid or a comet fragment, or a volcanic eruption. In the case of Vivaldi, it is possible that both occurred -- a heavy strike that caused a smooth internal lava flow.  Double-ringed craters are rare, and the cause of the inner rings remains a topic of research.  The speed-slowing gravity-assisted flyby of Mercury by BepiColombo was in preparation for the spacecraft entering orbit around the Solar System's innermost planet in 2026.","mercury, vivaldi, crater, bepicolombo, large, ring, smooth, floor, sure, unusual, feature, called, span, kilometer, imaged, great, detail, jaxa, robotic, spacecraft, month, circular, rocky, planet, moon, caused, impact, small, asteroid, comet, fragment, volcanic, eruption, case, possible, occurred, heavy, strike, internal, lava, flow, double-ringed, rare, cause, inner, remains, topic, research, speed-slowing, gravity-assisted, flyby, preparation, entering, orbit, solar, system, innermost"
Melotte 15 in the Heart Nebula,"Cosmic clouds form fantastic shapes in the central regions of emission nebula IC 1805. The clouds are sculpted by stellar winds and radiation from massive hot stars in the nebula's newborn star cluster, Melotte 15. About 1.5 million years young, the cluster stars are scattered in this colorful skyscape, along with dark dust clouds in silhouette against glowing atomic gas. A composite of narrowband and broadband telescopic images, the view spans about 15 light-years and includes emission from ionized hydrogen, sulfur, and oxygen atoms mapped to green, red, and blue hues in the popular Hubble Palette. Wider field images reveal that IC 1805's simpler, overall outline suggests its popular name - the Heart Nebula.

The Mermaid Nebula Supernova Remnant,"New stars are born from the remnants of dead stars. The gaseous remnant of the gravitational collapse and subsequent death of a very massive star in our Milky Way created the G296.5+10.0 supernova remnant, of which the featured Mermaid Nebula is part. Also known as the Betta Fish Nebula, the Mermaid Nebula makes up part of an unusual subclass of supernova remnants that are two-sided and nearly circular. Originally discovered in X-rays, the filamentary nebula is a frequently studied source also in radio and gamma-ray light.  The blue color visible here originates from doubly ionized oxygen (OIII), while the deep red is emitted by hydrogen gas. The nebula's mermaid-like shape has proven to be useful for measurements of the interstellar magnetic field.

The Dark Seahorse of Cepheus,"Spanning light-years, this suggestive shape known as the Seahorse Nebula floats in silhouette against a rich, luminous background of stars. Seen toward the royal northern constellation of Cepheus, the dusty, dark nebula is part of a Milky Way molecular cloud some 1,200 light-years distant. It is also listed as Barnard 150 (B150), one of 182 dark markings of the sky cataloged in the early 20th century by astronomer E. E. Barnard. Packs of low mass stars are forming within, but their collapsing cores are only visible at long infrared wavelengths.

A Hazy Harvest Moon,"For northern hemisphere dwellers, September's Full Moon was the Harvest Moon. On September 17/18 the sunlit lunar nearside passed into shadow, just grazing Earth's umbra, the planet's dark, central shadow cone, in a partial lunar eclipse. Over the two and a half hours before dawn a camera fixed to a tripod was used to record this series of exposures as the eclipsed Harvest Moon set behind Spiš Castle in the hazy morning sky over eastern Slovakia. Famed in festival, story, and song, Harvest Moon is just the traditional name of the full moon nearest the autumnal equinox.  According to lore the name is a fitting one. Despite the diminishing daylight hours as the growing season drew to a close, farmers could harvest crops by the light of a full moon shining on from dusk to dawn. This September's Harvest Moon was also known to some as a supermoon, a term becoming a traditional name for a full moon near perigee.","hazy, harvest, moon, northern, dweller, september, full, sunlit, lunar, passed, shadow, grazing, earth, umbra, planet, dark, central, cone, partial, eclipse, half, hour, dawn, camera, fixed, tripod, used, record, series, exposure, eclipsed, spiš, castle, morning, eastern, slovakia, famed, festival, story, song, traditional, name, nearest, autumnal, equinox, according, fitting, diminishing, daylight, growing, season, drew, close, farmer, crop, light, shining, dusk, known, supermoon, term, becoming, perigee"
Sunrise Shadows in the Sky,"The defining astronomical moment of this September's equinox is at 12:44 UTC on September 22, when the Sun crosses the celestial equator moving south in its yearly journey through planet Earth's sky. That marks the beginning of fall for our fair planet in the northern hemisphere and spring in the southern hemisphere, when day and night are nearly equal around the globe.  Of course, if you celebrate the astronomical change of seasons by watching a sunrise you can also look for crepuscular rays. Outlined by shadows cast by clouds, crepuscular rays can have a dramatic appearance in the twilight sky during any sunrise (or sunset). Due to perspective, the parallel cloud shadows will seem to point back to the rising Sun and a place due east on your horizon on the equinox date. But in this spectacular sunrise skyscape captured in early June, the parallel shadows and crepuscular rays appear to converge toward an eastern horizon's more northerly sunrise.  The well-composed photo places the rising Sun just behind the bell tower of a church in the town of Vic, province of Barcelona, Catalonia, Spain.","sunrise, shadow, defining, astronomical, moment, september, equinox, cross, celestial, equator, moving, journey, planet, earth, mark, beginning, fall, fair, northern, spring, southern, night, equal, globe, course, celebrate, change, season, watching, look, crepuscular, outlined, cast, cloud, dramatic, appearance, twilight, sunset, perspective, parallel, seem, point, rising, place, horizon, date, spectacular, skyscape, captured, early, june, appear, converge, eastern, northerly, well-composed, photo, bell, church, town, province, barcelona, catalonia, spain"
Chicagohenge: Equinox in an Aligned City,"Chicago, in a way, is like a modern Stonehenge. The way is east to west, and the time is today.  Today, and every equinox, the Sun will set exactly to the west, everywhere on Earth. Therefore, today in Chicago, the Sun will set directly down the long equatorially-aligned grid of streets and buildings, an event dubbed #chicagohenge.  Featured here is a Chicago Henge picture taken during the  equinox in mid-September of 2017 looking along part of Upper Wacker Drive.

Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS Approaches,"What will happen as this already bright comet approaches?  Optimistic predictions have Comet C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS) briefly becoming easily visible to the unaided eye -- although the future brightness of comets are notoriously hard to predict, and this comet may even break up in warming sunlight. What is certain is that the comet is now unexpectedly bright and is on track to pass its closest to the Sun (0.39 AU) later this week and closest to the Earth (0.47 AU) early next month.  The featured image was taken in late May as Comet Tsuchinshan–ATLAS, discovered only last year, passed nearly in front of two distant galaxies.  The comet can now be found with binoculars in the early morning sky rising just before the Sun, while over the next few weeks it will brighten as it moves to the early evening sky.

NGC 6727: The Rampaging Baboon Nebula,"This dusty region is forming stars. Part of a sprawling molecular cloud complex that resembles, to some, a rampaging baboon, the region is a relatively close by 500 light-years away toward the constellation Corona Australis. That's about one third the distance of the more famous stellar nursery known as the Orion Nebula.  Mixed with bright nebulosities, the brown dust clouds effectively block light from more distant background stars in the Milky Way and obscure from view embedded stars still in the process of formation.  The eyes of the dust creature in the featured image are actually blue reflection nebulas cataloged as NGC 6726, 6727, 6729, and IC 4812, while the red mouth glows with light emitted by hydrogen gas.

Comet A3 Through an Australian Sunrise,"Comet Tsuchinshan-ATLAS is now visible in the early morning sky.  Diving into the inner Solar System at an odd angle, this large dirty iceberg will pass its closest to the Sun -- between the orbits of Mercury and Venus -- in just two days. Long camera exposures are now capturing C/2023 A3 (Tsuchinshan–ATLAS), sometimes abbreviated as just A3, and its dust tail before and during sunrise.  The featured image composite was taken four days ago and captured the comet as it rose above Lake George, NSW, Australia.  Vertical bands further left are images of the comet as the rising Sun made the predawn sky increasingly bright and colorful. Just how bright the comet will become over the next month is currently unknown as it involves how much gas and dust the comet's nucleus will expel.

The Great Globular Cluster in Hercules,"In 1716, English astronomer Edmond Halley noted, ""This is but a little Patch, but it shows itself to the naked Eye, when the Sky is serene and the Moon absent."" Of course, M13 is now less modestly recognized as the Great Globular Cluster in Hercules, one of the brightest globular star clusters in the northern sky. Sharp telescopic views like this one reveal the spectacular cluster's hundreds of thousands of stars. At a distance of 25,000 light-years, the cluster stars crowd into a region 150 light-years in diameter. Approaching the cluster core, upwards of 100 stars could be contained in a cube just 3 light-years on a side. For comparison, the closest star to the Sun is over 4 light-years away.

Stellar Streams in the Local Universe,"The twenty galaxies arrayed in these panels are part of an ambitious astronomical survey of tidal stellar streams. Each panel presents a composite view; a deep, inverted image taken from publicly available imaging surveys of a field that surrounds a nearby massive galaxy image. The inverted images reveal faint cosmic structures, star streams hundreds of thousands of light-years across, that result from the gravitational disruption and eventual merger of satellite galaxies in the local universe. Such surveys of mergers and gravitational tidal interactions between massive galaxies and their dwarf satellites are crucial guides for current models of galaxy formation and cosmology. Of course, the detection of stellar streams in the neighboring Andromeda Galaxy and our own Milky Way also offers spectacular evidence for ongoing satellite galaxy disruption within our more local galaxy group.","stellar, stream, local, universe, twenty, galaxy, arrayed, panel, part, ambitious, astronomical, survey, tidal, present, composite, view, inverted, image, taken, available, imaging, field, surround, massive, reveal, faint, cosmic, structure, star, hundred, light-year, result, gravitational, disruption, eventual, merger, satellite, interaction, dwarf, crucial, guide, current, model, formation, cosmology, course, detection, neighboring, andromeda, milky, offer, spectacular, evidence, ongoing, group"
